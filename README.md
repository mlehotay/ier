## Notes

* `IER-paper/` and `IER-book/` are **in-corpus but non-canonical**
* They introduce no new theory claims
* They exist for dissemination and publication only

**Informational Experiential Realism**

*Experience is real by identity.
Reality remains singular.
Ethics begins wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.*
