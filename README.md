# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**

This repository contains the materials for **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** —
a strictly physicalist identity framework for experience, agency, and moral standing.

---

## Repository Structure

```
IER/          ← Canonical IER corpus (source of truth)
IER-paper/    ← Paper source and submission materials
IER-book/     ← Book assembly, publishing, and legal materials
```

Only these directories are part of the IER project.
Other folders are out of scope.

## Where Authority Lives

* **Normative authority:** [`IER/IER-specification.md`](IER/IER-specification.md)
* **Canon and governance:** [`IER/IER-canon.md`](IER/IER-canon.md)
* **Corpus inventory:** [`IER/IER-manifest.md`](IER/IER-manifest.md)

All interpretation, ordering disputes, and conflict resolution defer to the canon.

## Roles of the Non-Canonical Directories

* **`IER-paper/`**

  * Contains a paper derived from the canonical corpus
  * Introduces no new theory
  * Serves as the **Preface** of the book

* **`IER-book/`**

  * Contains structural and publishing materials for the book
  * Assembles canonical content into book form
  * Introduces no new theory

Both directories are **in-corpus but non-canonical**.

## How to Start

If you are new to IER:

1. Open [`IER/`](IER/)
2. Read [`IER/README.md`](IER/README.md)
3. Follow a suggested reading path

You do not need to read everything.

## Notes

* Canonical content lives **only** in `IER/`
* `IER-paper/` contains source material, not generated artifacts
* `IER-book/` contains assembly structure, not theory
* Publication formats do not define content or authority

**Informational Experiential Realism**

*Experience is real by identity.
Reality remains singular.
Ethics begins wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.*
