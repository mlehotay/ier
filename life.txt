So I was just thinking that the "overflow" region of an infinite digit is makes it like complex numbers.
there is a real part and an imaginary part
you can do a something like a fourrier transformation to decompose a number into its prime components
also the imaginary part is like the information dimension. you can store data there
the value of the int can be kept constant and you can alter the overflow digits to store data
in them. You can manipulate the information bits in the information dimension by performing mathemetical operations.
I can find a sequence of addions and subtrracts that leave secret ASCII messages in the info bits
Write a hello world app. If somebody has my sequence of operations they can perfrom it anywhere
an produce their own copy of the data.
the information dimension can be used to transmit information across space.
i could write a game like conways game of life but the cells have programmed behaviour!
start small by just giving them a one bit flag that affects the cell adjacency & interaction rules.
