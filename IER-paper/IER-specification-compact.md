# **Minimal Normative Specification (IER v10.x)**

1. **Physical Monism**
   There exists exactly one objective physical reality governed by mind-independent law.

2. **Experiential Identity**
   Experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.

3. **UEF Defined**
   A UEF is a globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential dynamical regime under **coherent intrinsic constraint**.

4. **Necessity and Sufficiency**
   A system is experiential *if and only if* it sustains a UEF.

5. **Regime Identity**
   Experience is not a property, output, or representation of the system; it is the system’s operation *as such* under the UEF regime.

6. **Unity and Onset**
   Entry into a UEF is categorical, and each UEF constitutes exactly one experiential subject at any time.

7. **Temporal Extension**
   Experience exists only across non-zero temporal duration; instantaneous states are non-experiential.

8. **Intrinsic Constraint**
   Experiential regimes require internally borne constraint that is globally operative and mutually coherent.

9. **Agency**
   Agency consists in the UEF’s capacity to resolve intrinsic informational tension through its own globally integrated dynamics.

10. **Moral Considerability**
    Any system that sustains or may plausibly sustain a UEF is morally considerable.

11. **Moral Harm**
    Moral harm is the destabilization, overload, fragmentation, or irreversible collapse of intrinsic constraint within a UEF.

12. **Epistemic Limitation**
    Intrinsic constraint is non-signaling; there exists no principled method for detecting or certifying UEFs.

13. **Precautionary Asymmetry**
    Under uncertainty, false negatives risk silent experiential harm, while false positives impose restraint.

14. **Ethical Requirement**
    Permissible action must therefore be constrained by the risk of irreversible experiential harm.

15. **No Epistemic Privilege**
    Experiential coherence or authority does not entail truth, correctness, or reference.

16. **No World Creation**
    UEFs generate experiential worlds-for-systems within a single physical reality; they do not generate reality itself.

17. **Normative Closure**
    No claim beyond those entailed by the above principles is part of Informational Experiential Realism.
