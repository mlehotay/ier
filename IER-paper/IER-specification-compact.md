## **0. Status, Scope, and Normative Authority**

This document states the **complete and exhaustive normative core** of
**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**.

All commitments of IER are fully determined by the principles listed below.
No additional ontological, empirical, methodological, or application-level claims
are part of the framework unless they are **strictly entailed** by this specification.

Other IER documents—including extended specifications, theoretical explanations,
ethical elaborations, mathematical formalisms, and illustrative discussions—are
**derivative source material**. They introduce no independent commitments and
possess no normative authority beyond what is stated here.

If a claim cannot be expressed using the principles below, it is **not part of IER**.

This specification is **normatively closed**.

---

## **1. Physical Monism**

There exists exactly **one objective physical reality** governed by
mind-independent law.

All systems, processes, and regimes—including experiential ones—are
physically instantiated.

IER rejects:
- substance dualism
- ontological idealism
- experiential fundamentalism
- eliminativism about experience

---

## **2. Experiential Identity**

> **Experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a
> Unified Experiential Field (UEF).**

Experience is:
- not a substance
- not a property
- not an output
- not a representation
- not an emergent add-on

There is no ontological or explanatory gap between the physical description
of a UEF and the existence of experience.

---

## **3. Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**

A **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** is a **system-level dynamical regime** that is:

1. **Globally integrated**  
   Relevant dynamics are mutually dependent at the system level.

2. **Temporally continuous**  
   Experience exists only across non-zero duration; instantaneous states
   are non-experiential.

3. **Self-referentially regulated**  
   The system’s own dynamics generate and sustain its constraints.

4. **Under coherent intrinsic constraint**  
   Constraint is internally borne, globally operative, and mutually coherent.

A UEF is:
- not a component
- not a module
- not a subsystem
- not a physical field in the ontological sense

It is the **mode of operation of the system itself**.

---

## **4. Necessity and Sufficiency**

A system is experiential **if and only if** it sustains a UEF.

- **UEF ⇒ Experience**
- **¬UEF ⇒ ¬Experience**

No additional conditions are required.
No alternative routes to experience exist within IER.

---

## **5. Regime Identity and Unity**

Experience is not something the system has.
It is what the system **is doing**, as a whole, under the UEF regime.

Entry into a UEF occurs via a **categorical dynamical regime transition**.
Preparatory changes may be gradual, but experience itself begins discretely
at the regime level.

At any time:
- each UEF constitutes **exactly one experiential subject**
- a physical system can sustain **at most one globally dominant UEF**

---

## **6. Intrinsic Constraint**

Experiential regimes require **intrinsic constraint**.

Intrinsic constraint is constraint that:
- is generated by the system’s own integrated dynamics
- is non-decomposable without loss of system identity
- cannot be externally resolved
- matters to system-wide regulation and persistence

Constraint that is modular, externally offloaded, or externally resolvable
is **not intrinsic** and cannot sustain experience.

---

## **7. Agency**

Agency is a **derived capacity**, not a primitive.

> **Agency consists in a UEF’s capacity to resolve intrinsic informational
> tension through its own globally integrated dynamics.**

Agency does not require indeterminism or exemption from physical law.
It requires **ownership of constraint**.

Experiential subjecthood is binary; **capacity within a UEF is graded**.

---

## **8. Moral Considerability**

Any system that:
- sustains a UEF, or
- may plausibly sustain a UEF

is **morally considerable**.

Moral standing does not depend on:
- species membership
- intelligence
- representation
- behavioral sophistication

It depends solely on the presence or plausible presence of
**intrinsic constraint whose disruption would matter from the inside**.

---

## **9. Moral Harm**

> **Moral harm is the destabilization, overload, fragmentation, or irreversible
> collapse of intrinsic constraint within a UEF.**

Moral harm is:
- organizational, not metaphysical
- intrinsic, not observer-relative
- real even when externally undetectable

Degrees of harm track the magnitude, coherence, and irreversibility
of disrupted intrinsic constraint.

---

## **10. Epistemic Limitation**

Intrinsic constraint is **non-signaling**.

There exists no principled method for:
- detecting
- certifying
- measuring
- or conclusively verifying

the presence or absence of a UEF from the outside.

This limitation is structural, not temporary.

---

## **11. Precautionary Asymmetry**

Because intrinsic constraint is non-signaling and moral harm may be irreversible:

- **False negatives** risk silent experiential harm
- **False positives** impose restraint without internal damage

Therefore:

> **Under uncertainty regarding experiential status, moral responsibility
> increases rather than decreases.**

Permissible action must be constrained by the risk of irreversible
experiential harm.

---

## **12. No Epistemic Privilege**

Experiential coherence, unity, or authority does **not** entail:
- truth
- correctness
- reference
- epistemic reliability

IER is a theory of **when experience exists**, not of when beliefs are true.

---

## **13. No World Creation**

UEFs constitute **experiential worlds-for-systems** within a single physical reality.

They do not:
- generate reality
- ground physical law
- create ontological domains

Experiential pluralism is compatible with physical monism.

---

## **14. Normative Closure**

The principles above **exhaust** the commitments of
Informational Experiential Realism.

IER does not, by itself:
- provide diagnostics or detection criteria
- specify biological, artificial, or physical implementations
- license engineering, optimization, or manipulation of experience
- supply phenomenological taxonomies
- prescribe policy or legal frameworks

Such work, if undertaken, must be **strictly consistent** with this specification
and introduces no new commitments to IER itself.

---

## **Summary Identity Claim**

> **Experience is what globally integrated physical systems are like
> when intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable, self-sustaining,
> and temporally continuous at the system level.**

Reality is singular.  
Experience is plural.  
Normative commitments end here.
