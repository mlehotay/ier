## Identity Theory & Physicalism

1. **Smart, J. J. C. (1959).**
   *Sensations and brain processes.*
   *Philosophical Review, 68*(2), 141–156.
   **Tag:** **CRITICAL**
   **Why:** Canonical mind–brain identity theory. Citing this establishes that IER is in dialogue with, not ignorant of, classical identity claims—while differing in *what* is identified.

2. **Place, U. T. (1956).**
   *Is consciousness a brain process?*
   *British Journal of Psychology, 47*(1), 44–50.
   **Tag:** **CRITICAL**
   **Why:** The other foundational identity text. Helps distinguish your **system-level dynamical identity** from early state-based views.

## Dynamical / Organizational Accounts of Mind

3. **Thompson, E. (2007).**
   *Mind in Life: Biology, Phenomenology, and the Sciences of Mind.*
   Harvard University Press.
   **Tag:** **CRITICAL**
   **Why:** Establishes legitimacy of *organizational* and *dynamical* approaches without representational functionalism. You diverge, but the lineage is clear.

4. **Kelso, J. A. S. (1995).**
   *Dynamic Patterns: The Self-Organization of Brain and Behavior.*
   MIT Press.
   **Tag:** **OPTIONAL**
   **Why:** Supports talk of regime transitions and global dynamical organization, but not required if you want to stay purely conceptual.

## Constraint-Based Organization

5. **Moreno, A., & Mossio, M. (2015).**
   *Biological Autonomy: A Philosophical and Theoretical Enquiry.*
   Springer.
   **Tag:** **CRITICAL**
   **Why:** This is the strongest existing framework for **intrinsic constraint** and self-maintaining organization. You are not adopting their theory wholesale, but this citation legitimizes your core vocabulary.

6. **Hooker, C. A. (2011).**
   *Philosophy of Complex Systems.*
   Elsevier.
   **Tag:** **OPTIONAL**
   **Why:** Broad systems-theoretic background for global constraint and integration; not consciousness-specific.

## Consciousness Theories You Explicitly Diverge From

7. **Baars, B. J. (1988).**
   *A Cognitive Theory of Consciousness.*
   Cambridge University Press.
   **Tag:** **CRITICAL**
   **Why:** Canonical Global Workspace Theory. Citing it clarifies that IER does **not** ground experience in access, broadcast, or reportability.

8. **Dennett, D. C. (1991).**
   *Consciousness Explained.*
   Little, Brown and Company.
   **Tag:** **CRITICAL**
   **Why:** Representative of eliminativist / deflationary approaches you explicitly reject.

9. **Chalmers, D. J. (1996).**
   *The Conscious Mind.*
   Oxford University Press.
   **Tag:** **CRITICAL**
   **Why:** Frames the hard problem and property dualism you deny. Including this shows you are not sidestepping the central debate.

## Panpsychism and Restrictive Alternatives

10. **Goff, P. (2017).**
    *Consciousness and Fundamental Reality.*
    Oxford University Press.
    **Tag:** **CRITICAL**
    **Why:** Representative modern panpsychism. Citing this allows you to explicitly contrast your **restrictive criterion** with ubiquitous experience views.

11. **Strawson, G. (2006).**
    *Realistic monism: Why physicalism entails panpsychism.*
    *Journal of Consciousness Studies, 13*(10–11), 3–31.
    **Tag:** **OPTIONAL**
    **Why:** Useful if you want to pre-empt “identity → panpsychism” objections, but not strictly necessary.

12. **Kastrup, B. (2018).**
    *The universe in consciousness.*
    *Journal of Consciousness Studies, 25*(5–6), 125–155.
    **Tag:** **CRITICAL (Contrastive)**
    **Why:** * Author is a well-known contemporary philosopher of mind

## Ethics of Consciousness & Moral Considerability

13. **Birch, J. (2020).**
    *Animal sentience and the precautionary principle.*
    *Animal Sentience, 29*(1).
    **Tag:** **CRITICAL**
    **Why:** Directly supports your **precautionary asymmetry** argument, without committing you to behavioral or species-based criteria.

14. **Nagel, T. (1974).**
    *What is it like to be a bat?*
    *Philosophical Review, 83*(4), 435–450.
    **Tag:** **OPTIONAL**
    **Why:** Classic subjectivity paper. Helpful for readers, but your framework does not depend on it.
