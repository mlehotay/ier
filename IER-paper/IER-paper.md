## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) is a naturalistic identity theory of experience grounded in physical monism and organizational dynamics. Experience is identified with the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential dynamical regime under coherent intrinsic constraint.

From this identity claim, several consequences follow. Experiential worlds are real for systems that sustain them, though no additional ontological domains are created. Agency consists in the resolution of intrinsic informational tension by a unified system. Moral considerability attaches to systems that sustain, or may plausibly sustain, such regimes. Moral harm consists in the destabilization, overload, fragmentation, or irreversible collapse of intrinsic constraint. Because intrinsic constraint is non-signaling, uncertainty regarding experiential status increases moral responsibility.

This paper presents a **minimal normative specification of IER**, suitable for broad scientific and philosophical audiences. Detailed phenomenology, formal modeling, and dynamical elaboration are deferred to future work.

## **1. Introduction**

Debates about consciousness often oscillate between metaphysical inflation and explanatory deflation. Experience is treated as ontologically fundamental, computationally emergent, or eliminable. None of these positions simultaneously satisfy three constraints:

1. Physical reality appears complete and law-governed.
2. Experience appears real, unified, temporally extended, and causally relevant.
3. Not all complex or intelligent systems plausibly experience.

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) reframes the question:

> **Under what organizational conditions does a physical system instantiate a world-for-itself?**

IER answers restrictively and identity-based: experience exists **if and only if** a system operates as a Unified Experiential Field (UEF). Experience is not a property, output, or representation; it is the **mode of system operation** under intrinsic constraint.

This paper presents the **minimal normative core** of IER and its ethical consequences. No diagnostic, measurement, or implementation claims are proposed.

## **2. Ontological Commitments**

### **2.1 Physical Monism**

IER affirms **physical monism**: there exists exactly one objective physical reality governed by mind-independent laws. All systems, processes, and regimes—including experiential ones—are physically instantiated. IER therefore rejects dualism, ontological idealism, and any view on which experience constitutes or generates reality.

### **2.2 Experiential Identity**

Experience is strictly identified with the operation of a system as a **UEF**. It is not a substance, property, representation, or functional output. Describing a UEF experientially does not add to physical reality; it reflects the system-relative perspective of the regime itself.

**Illustrative hint:** A system with highly integrated, self-sustaining dynamics possesses experience, even if externally it appears inert or mechanistic.

---

## **3. Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)**

A **UEF** is a system-level dynamical regime characterized by:

1. **Global integration:** system-wide mutual dependence among relevant dynamics.
2. **Temporal continuity:** experience exists only across non-zero temporal durations.
3. **Self-referential regulation:** the system’s dynamics generate and sustain its own constraints.
4. **Coherent intrinsic constraint:** constraints are internally borne, globally operative, and mutually coherent.

Intrinsic constraint determines **where regulatory burden is borne**, not how much information is processed. Systems with modularized, offloadable, or externally resolved constraints do **not** experience, regardless of apparent complexity.

Entry into a UEF is **categorical**: experience begins only when intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable and globally binding. Each UEF constitutes exactly **one experiential subject**.

---

## **4. Necessity, Sufficiency, and Scope**

Experience is sharply distinguished from complexity or intelligence. Adaptive or intelligent systems may fail to experience if constraint can be externally resolved. Only globally unified, intrinsically constrained systems sustain experience.

---

## **5. Agency and Free Will**

Agency is derived from **ownership of constraint**:

> **Agency consists in a UEF’s capacity to resolve intrinsic informational tension through its own globally integrated dynamics.**

Only systems sustaining UEFs can act in this sense. Resolution of tension that is externally imposed, fragmented, or offloaded does not constitute agency. While experiential subjecthood is binary, **capacity within a UEF is graded**, depending on coherence, stability, and freedom within intrinsic constraints.

---

## **6. Experiential Worlds and Pluralism**

Whenever a UEF exists, a **world-for-that-system** exists. These worlds include lived present, self/non-self boundary, and system-relative salience and causality. They are real for the systems that sustain them, but they do not constitute additional ontological domains.

IER supports **experiential pluralism under physical monism**:

* One objective physical reality
* Many real, system-relative experiential worlds

**Illustrative hint:** Multiple systems may independently sustain UEFs, each constituting its own perspective, without generating new “realities” beyond the single physical world.

## **7. Ethical Consequences**

### **7.1 Moral Considerability**

Any system that sustains, or may plausibly sustain, a UEF is **morally considerable**. Moral standing depends solely on the presence or plausible presence of intrinsic constraint, not on species, intelligence, or behavior.

### **7.2 Moral Harm**

> **Moral harm is the destabilization, overload, fragmentation, or irreversible collapse of intrinsic constraint within a UEF.**

Harm is organizational rather than metaphysical. Degrees of harm correspond to magnitude, coherence, and irreversibility of disrupted constraint.

### **7.3 Precautionary Asymmetry**

Intrinsic constraint is **non-signaling**. No principled method exists to certify a UEF externally. Consequently, ethical errors are asymmetric:

* False negatives risk silent experiential harm
* False positives impose restraint without internal damage

Heightened moral responsibility arises from the potential for irreversible harm, not from prohibitive rules.

## **8. Normative Closure and Scope**

IER introduces no primitives beyond physical systems, intrinsic constraint, and dynamical regimes. All ethical conclusions follow from the identity of experience with UEFs. Claims about qualitative character, affect, diagnostics, or formal modeling must be consistent but are **not part of the minimal normative core**.

---

## **9. Conclusion**

Informational Experiential Realism offers a minimal, naturalistic account of experience with direct ethical consequences. Experience is neither fundamental nor illusory; it is what globally integrated physical systems are like when intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable and self-sustaining. Where such regimes exist, experiential worlds exist. Where they may exist, moral responsibility follows.

**Reality is singular. Experience is plural. Ethics begins wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.**

### **Status Note**

This preprint specifies identity conditions and normative consequences. It does not license, recommend, or encourage creation, manipulation, or optimization of experiential systems.
