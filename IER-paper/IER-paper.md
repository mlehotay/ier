## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) advances a single ontological identity claim: **experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**. A UEF is a system-level dynamical regime characterized by global integration, temporal continuity, self-regulation, and internally generated constraint that is not externally resolvable. This claim is neither emergentist nor correlational; it does not posit experience as an additional property, substance, representation, or functional output. Rather, it identifies experience with a specific kind of physical organization.

The paper makes no claims about phenomenology, diagnostics, measurement, degrees of experience, empirical detection, moral responsibility, or applied ethics. It proposes no criteria for identifying UEFs in practice and does not argue for any particular biological, computational, or architectural implementation. Its sole aim is to state and defend the coherence of the identity thesis itself within a physically monist ontology.

If the identity claim is correct, experiential plurality follows without ontological multiplication: one objective physical reality can support multiple system-relative experiential fields. If it is incorrect, no supplementary mechanisms or explanatory bridges are available within the framework to repair it. The contribution of the paper is therefore limited, categorical, and conditional: **either experience is identical to a specific physical regime, or the account fails outright**.

## **1. Introduction**

Debates about consciousness are often structured around a dilemma. Either experience is treated as ontologically fundamental—requiring additional substances, properties, or laws—or it is treated as explanatorily dispensable, reduced to functional, representational, or behavioral descriptions that omit what experience itself is.

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) rejects this dilemma. It does not attempt to explain how experience arises from non-experiential matter, nor does it seek to eliminate experience by redescribing its correlates. Instead, IER advances a **strict identity claim**: experience is identical to a particular way certain physical systems operate.

This paper has a deliberately narrow aim. It does not offer a theory of phenomenology, agency, meaning, or ethics. It does not propose diagnostic tests or empirical markers. It does not argue that any specific system is experiential. Its sole purpose is to articulate and defend the coherence of the identity claim itself.

## **2. Ontological Commitments**

### **2.1 Physical Monism**

IER affirms a single objective physical reality governed by mind-independent law. All systems, processes, and regimes—including experiential ones—are physically instantiated. The view rejects substance dualism, property dualism, ontological idealism, experiential fundamentalism, and eliminativism about experience.

No non-physical substances, properties, forces, or explanatory domains are introduced.

---

### **2.2 Identity, Not Correlation**

The central claim of IER is an identity claim, not a thesis about correlation, realization, or emergence. Experience does not accompany, supervene on, or arise from physical processes. It **is** a physical process, described at the level of system-wide organization.

Accordingly, a complete physical description of a system operating as a Unified Experiential Field leaves no further explanatory work for “experience” to do. There is no additional fact, property, or phenomenon beyond the regime itself.

## **3. Unified Experiential Fields**

### **3.1 Definition**

A **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** is a physical system operating in a dynamical regime that is:

1. **Globally integrated** — system dynamics are mutually dependent rather than decomposable into independent subsystems
2. **Temporally continuous** — the regime persists across non-zero duration
3. **Self-regulating** — the system generates and maintains its own organizational constraints
4. **Intrinsically constrained** — the system bears internally generated constraint that cannot be externally resolved, paused, or offloaded without loss of regime identity

These conditions are jointly necessary. No subset is sufficient.

---

### **3.2 Intrinsic Constraint**

Constraint is intrinsic if it arises from the integrated dynamics of the system itself, is identity-defining rather than contingent, and cannot be resolved through external intervention without altering what the system is doing at the regime level.

Intrinsic constraint is defined independently of experience. Experience is defined by reference to regimes of intrinsic constraint. This ordering prevents circularity.

---

### **3.3 Regime Identity**

A UEF is not a component, module, workspace, or representational structure. It is the **entire system operating in a specific regime**. Entry into such a regime constitutes entry into experience; exit from it constitutes the cessation of experience.

The term *field* is descriptive rather than ontological. It denotes global mutual constraint, not a spatial or physical field.

---

## **4. Categorical Onset and Exclusivity**

Experience, under IER, is a regime-level phenomenon. Preparatory variables may change continuously, but experience begins only when the system enters the relevant regime. Onset is therefore **categorical at the regime level**, not scalar or incremental.

A physical system can sustain **at most one globally dominant UEF at a time**. Multiple local processes may coexist, but they do not constitute multiple experiential subjects unless they instantiate distinct, globally integrated regimes.

---

## **5. Experiential Pluralism Without Ontological Multiplication**

IER entails experiential pluralism: many experiential fields may exist simultaneously. This plurality is not ontological but perspectival. There remains exactly one physical reality; experiential plurality consists in the existence of multiple system-relative fields within it.

This pluralism does not require fundamental experience, micro-experiences, or compositional aggregation. It follows directly from the identity claim applied to multiple physical systems.

---

## **6. What This Paper Does Not Claim**

Because misreadings of identity theories are common, it is important to state explicitly what is **not** claimed here.

This paper does **not**:

* characterize phenomenology or “what it is like”
* propose metrics, measurements, or degrees of experience
* provide empirical or behavioral diagnostics
* argue that any particular system is experiential
* define agency, moral responsibility, or ethical obligation
* license inference from behavior, complexity, or intelligence to experience
* endorse panpsychism, functionalism, or emergentism

All such questions, if meaningful, are downstream of—and constrained by—the identity claim. They are not addressed here.

---

## **7. Failure Conditions**

IER is intentionally brittle. If experience is not identical to the operation of a Unified Experiential Field as defined, the framework offers no auxiliary mechanisms, bridging principles, or fallback explanations. There is nothing to revise except the identity claim itself.

This brittleness is a feature rather than a defect. It makes clear what would count as success or failure and prevents ad hoc supplementation.

---

## **8. Conclusion**

Informational Experiential Realism proposes a minimal but demanding thesis: **experience is identical to a specific organizational regime of physical systems**. The theory neither inflates ontology nor explains experience away. It stands or falls with the coherence of the identity claim.

If the claim is correct, experience is fully real, fully physical, and fully accounted for at the level of system-wide dynamics. If it is incorrect, no weaker version of the view remains. There is no explanatory middle ground.
