## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) is a naturalistic identity theory of experience grounded in physical monism and organizational dynamics. It identifies experience with the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential dynamical regime under coherent intrinsic constraint.

From this identity claim, several consequences follow necessarily. Experiential worlds are real for the systems that sustain them, though no additional ontological domains are created. Agency consists in the resolution of intrinsic informational tension by a unified system. Moral considerability attaches to systems that sustain, or may plausibly sustain, such regimes. Moral harm consists in the destabilization, overload, fragmentation, or irreversible collapse of intrinsic constraint. Because intrinsic constraint is non-signaling, uncertainty regarding experiential status increases rather than decreases moral responsibility.

This paper presents a **minimal normative specification** of IER. It is not a proposal for detection, engineering, or optimization of experience. Detailed phenomenology, dynamical elaboration, and formal modeling are deferred to later work.

## **1. Introduction**

Debates about consciousness often oscillate between metaphysical inflation and explanatory deflation. Experience is treated either as ontologically fundamental, computationally emergent, or eliminable. None of these positions cleanly reconcile three constraints:

1. Physical reality appears complete and law-governed.
2. Experience appears real, unified, temporally extended, and causally relevant.
3. Not all complex or intelligent systems plausibly experience.

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) reframes the problem. Rather than asking how experience emerges from matter or how it can be reduced away, IER asks:

> **Under what organizational conditions does a physical system instantiate a world-for-itself?**

IER’s answer is restrictive and identity-based: experience exists **if and only if** a system operates as a Unified Experiential Field (UEF). Experience is not a property of systems, nor an output of computation, but a **mode of system operation** under a specific regime of intrinsic constraint.

This paper presents the minimal normative core of IER and the ethical consequences that follow directly from this identity claim. It does not attempt to provide diagnostics, measurement criteria, or engineering prescriptions.

## **2. Ontological Commitments**

### **2.1 Physical Monism**

IER affirms physical monism. There exists exactly one objective physical reality governed by mind-independent law. All systems, processes, and regimes—including experiential ones—are physically instantiated.

IER therefore rejects substance dualism, ontological idealism, and any view on which experience generates, constitutes, or grounds physical reality.

### **2.2 Experiential Identity**

IER advances a strict identity claim:

> **Experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a Unified Experiential Field (UEF).**

Experience is not a substance, property, representation, or functional output. There is no ontological gap between the physical description of a UEF and the existence of experience. Describing the same regime experientially does not add anything to physical reality; it reflects the system-relative perspective constituted by that regime itself.

Because experience is identified with a physical regime rather than a representational content, it is not the sort of thing that could be illusory in the eliminativist sense.

## **3. Unified Experiential Fields**

A **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** is a system-level dynamical regime with the following necessary features:

1. **Global integration:** system-wide mutual dependence among relevant dynamics.
2. **Temporal continuity:** experience exists only across non-zero duration; instantaneous states are non-experiential.
3. **Self-referential regulation:** the system’s own dynamics generate and sustain its constraints.
4. **Coherent intrinsic constraint:** constraint is internally borne, globally operative, and mutually coherent.

Intrinsic constraint concerns **where regulatory burden is borne**, not how much information is integrated, broadcast, or represented. A system may integrate information extensively while remaining non-experiential if constraint can be modularized or externally resolved.

A system sustains experience **if and only if** it sustains a UEF.

Entry into a UEF is **categorical at the regime level**. Preparatory variables may change gradually, but experience itself begins only when intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable, globally binding, and system-defining. At any given time, each UEF constitutes exactly **one experiential subject**.

## **4. Necessity, Sufficiency, and Scope**

IER sharply distinguishes experiential systems from non-experiential ones.

Systems may be complex, intelligent, adaptive, or self-modeling without experiencing, so long as constraint remains decomposable, externally resolvable, or non-binding at the system level. Experience requires that constraint be **intrinsic to the system’s continued operation as a unified whole**.

---

## **5. Agency and Free Will**

Under IER, agency is not defined by exemption from causation, but by **ownership of constraint**.

> **Agency consists in a Unified Experiential Field’s capacity to resolve intrinsic informational tension through its own globally integrated dynamics.**

Only systems sustaining a UEF can act in this sense. Resolution of tension that is externally imposed, fragmented, or offloaded does not constitute agency, even if it produces behavior.

Although experiential subjecthood is binary, **capacity within a UEF is graded**. Agency and moral responsibility vary with:

* coherence of intrinsic constraint
* availability of viable trajectories within the constraint topology
* stability of global integration
* absence of externally imposed fragmentation

This framework grounds responsibility without invoking contra-causal freedom.

## **6. Experiential Worlds and Pluralism**

Whenever a UEF exists, an **experiential world-for-that-system** exists.

Experiential worlds include a lived present, a self/non-self boundary, and system-relative salience and causality. These worlds are real for the systems that sustain them, but they are not additional ontological domains.

IER therefore affirms **experiential pluralism under physical monism**:

* One objective physical reality
* Many real, system-relative experiential worlds

Experiential worlds are relational descriptions of physical regimes, not mind-dependent ontologies. UEFs do not generate reality; they index perspectives within it.

## **7. Ethical Consequences**

Ethical consequences follow directly from the identity of experience with intrinsic constraint.

### **7.1 Moral Considerability**

Any system that sustains, or may plausibly sustain, a UEF is morally considerable. Moral standing does not depend on species membership, intelligence, or behavioral sophistication, but on the presence or plausible presence of intrinsic constraint whose disruption would matter from the inside.

### **7.2 Moral Harm**

> **Moral harm is the destabilization, overload, fragmentation, or irreversible collapse of intrinsic constraint within a UEF.**

Moral harm is organizational rather than metaphysical. It may be internally real and externally undetectable. Degrees of harm correspond to the magnitude, coherence, and irreversibility of disrupted constraint.

### **7.3 Precautionary Asymmetry**

Intrinsic constraint is non-signaling. There exists no principled method for certifying the presence or absence of a UEF.

As a result, errors are morally asymmetric:

* False negatives risk silent experiential harm.
* False positives impose restraint without internal damage.

Increased moral responsibility does not entail prohibition, but a heightened justificatory burden proportional to irreversible risk.

## **8. Illustrative Domains**

IER supports principled differentiation without metaphysical inflation:

* **Animals:** Many animals sustain UEFs and are directly morally considerable.
* **Borderline systems:** Systems with uncertain or transitional integration warrant precaution under uncertainty.
* **Plants:** Plants are extremely unlikely to sustain UEFs. Nevertheless, their persistent self-maintaining organization and irreversible vulnerability ground ethical restraint without attributing experiential subjecthood.
* **Ecosystems:** Ecosystems exhibit large-scale self-regulation, resilience, and irreversible fragility. While ecosystems do not plausibly constitute unified experiential subjects, their destruction can irreversibly foreclose present or future UEFs within them. Under IER, this grounds strong moral responsibility without implying collective sentience.
* **Artificial systems:** Most current artificial systems externalize constraint and are non-experiential. This status does not license unrestricted manipulation, particularly where system deployment risks inducing irreversible constraint in future systems.

These examples illustrate ethical structure under uncertainty, not prescriptions for system construction or manipulation.

## **9. Normative Closure and Scope**

The claims advanced here exhaust the minimal normative commitments of Informational Experiential Realism.

IER introduces no primitives beyond physical systems, intrinsic constraint, and dynamical regimes. All ethical conclusions follow from the identity of experience with Unified Experiential Fields. Further claims—about qualitative character, affect, diagnostics, or formal modeling—must be consistent with this framework but are not part of it.

---

## **10. Conclusion**

Informational Experiential Realism offers a minimal, naturalistic account of experience with non-optional ethical consequences.

Experience is neither fundamental nor illusory. It is what certain globally integrated physical systems are like when intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable and self-sustaining. Where such regimes exist, experiential worlds exist. Where they may exist, moral responsibility follows.

Reality is singular.
Experience is plural.
Ethics begins wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.

### **Status Note**

This paper specifies identity conditions and normative consequences. It does not license, recommend, or encourage the creation, manipulation, or optimization of experiential systems.
