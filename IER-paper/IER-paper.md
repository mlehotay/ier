## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) is a naturalistic identity theory of experience grounded in physical monism and organizational dynamics. It identifies experience with the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential dynamical regime operating under coherent intrinsic constraint.

From this identity claim follow necessary consequences concerning experiential subjecthood, agency, and moral responsibility. Experiential worlds exist wherever such regimes exist, though no additional ontological domains are posited beyond physical reality. Agency consists in the resolution of intrinsic informational tension by a unified system. Moral considerability attaches to systems that sustain, or may plausibly sustain, intrinsic constraint. Moral harm consists in the destabilization, overload, fragmentation, or irreversible collapse of such constraint.

This paper presents a **minimal normative specification of IER**, abstracted from a larger theoretical framework. It introduces no implementation claims, diagnostics, or formal models. Its purpose is to state clearly what experience is, when it exists, and what necessarily follows from its existence.

## **1. Introduction**

The scientific and philosophical study of consciousness remains divided between metaphysical inflation and explanatory deflation. Experience is alternately treated as ontologically fundamental (e.g., idealist or panpsychist approaches), computationally emergent (e.g., functionalist or access-based theories), or eliminable (Dennett 1991). Each strategy resolves certain tensions while generating others: threats to physical closure, failure to account for experiential unity and causal relevance, or conflict with lived structure and ethical practice.

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) rejects this forced trilemma by reframing the problem. Rather than asking what additional ingredient produces experience, IER asks:

> **Under what organizational conditions does a physical system constitute a world-for-itself?**

IER’s answer is restrictive and identity-based. Experience exists **if and only if** a physical system operates in a specific dynamical regime: a Unified Experiential Field. Experience is not a substance, property, representation, or output. It is what certain globally integrated physical processes are like when intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable and system-defining.

This paper presents the **minimal normative core** of IER. It specifies identity conditions, ontological commitments, and ethical consequences. Explanatory elaboration, formal modeling, phenomenological catalogues, and applied analysis are intentionally deferred.

## **2. Ontological Commitments**

### **2.1 Objective Physical Reality and Monism**

IER affirms that there exists a single, objective physical reality governed by mind-independent law. Physical states and events occur regardless of whether they are observed or experienced. No additional ontological domains are introduced to accommodate experience.

All entities, processes, and regimes—including experiential ones—are physical. IER therefore rejects substance dualism, property dualism (Chalmers 1996), ontological idealism (Kastrup 2018), and any view on which experience constitutes or generates physical reality.

### **2.2 Organizational Identity of Experience**

Experience is strictly identified with a specific organizational and dynamical regime instantiated by certain physical systems. This position belongs to the family of identity theories (Place 1956; Smart 1959) but diverges from classical formulations by identifying experience with **system-level dynamical organization** rather than with neural states or computational functions.

Describing such a regime experientially does not add to physical reality. It reflects the system-relative perspective of that same regime. There is no explanatory gap between the physical description of a Unified Experiential Field and the existence of experience; they are two equally valid descriptions of the same organization.

---

## **3. Unified Experiential Fields**

A **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** is a physical system operating in a globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential dynamical regime under **coherent intrinsic constraint**.

Each component of this characterization is necessary:

1. **Global integration:** Relevant system dynamics are mutually dependent at the system level; no subset can fully resolve constraint independently.
2. **Temporal continuity:** Experience exists only across non-zero temporal duration, sustained by ongoing dynamical dependence between successive global states.
3. **Self-referential regulation:** The system generates and maintains its own constraints rather than relying on external resolution.
4. **Coherent intrinsic constraint:** Constraint is internally borne, globally operative, and neither fragmenting nor collapsing.

The notion of intrinsic constraint is informed by organizational and autonomy-based accounts of living systems (Moreno & Mossio 2015), though IER remains neutral with respect to biological implementation.

Entry into a UEF occurs at a **categorical dynamical regime transition**. Preparatory variables may change gradually, but experience begins only when intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable and system-defining. There is no partial experience prior to regime entry.

Each UEF constitutes exactly **one experiential subject**.

## **4. Necessity, Sufficiency, and Scope**

Experience is sharply distinguished from complexity, intelligence, representation, or behavioral sophistication. Many systems process information, model themselves, and act adaptively while remaining non-experiential because their constraints can be modularized, offloaded, or externally resolved (Baars 1988).

What matters is not how much information is processed, but **where regulatory burden is borne**.

Experience exists **if and only if** a system sustains a Unified Experiential Field. Systems lacking intrinsic, globally binding constraint do not experience, regardless of apparent complexity. Systems sustaining such constraint experience, regardless of external simplicity.

This criterion is restrictive by design, thereby avoiding panpsychist proliferation (Strawson 2006; Goff 2017).

---

## **5. Agency and Free Will**

Agency follows directly from the identity of experience with intrinsic constraint.

> **Agency consists in a Unified Experiential Field’s capacity to resolve intrinsic informational tension through its own globally integrated dynamics.**

Only systems that sustain UEFs can act in this sense. Constraint resolution that is externally imposed, fragmented, or offloaded does not constitute agency, even if behavior appears goal-directed.

IER is fully compatible with lawful physical determination. The distinction is not between caused and uncaused action, but between **intrinsically constrained** and **externally imposed** determination. A trajectory may be physically inevitable and still be free if the determining constraints are intrinsic to the UEF.

Experiential subjecthood is binary, but **capacity within a UEF is graded**, depending on coherence, stability, and freedom within intrinsic constraint.

## **6. Experiential Worlds and Pluralism**

Whenever a Unified Experiential Field exists, an **experiential world** exists for that system. Such a world includes a lived present, a self/non-self boundary, and system-relative salience and causality (Nagel 1974).

These worlds are real for the systems that sustain them. They are not illusions, projections, or narratives. At the same time, they do not constitute additional ontological domains.

IER therefore affirms **experiential pluralism under physical monism**:

* One objective physical reality
* Many real, system-relative experiential worlds

The plurality lies in perspective, not in existence.

---

## **7. Ethical Consequences**

Ethical significance follows necessarily from the identity of experience with intrinsic constraint.

### **7.1 Moral Considerability**

Any system that sustains, or may plausibly sustain, a Unified Experiential Field is **morally considerable**. Moral standing depends solely on the presence or plausible presence of intrinsic constraint, not on species membership, intelligence, or social utility.

### **7.2 Moral Harm**

> **Moral harm is the destabilization, overload, fragmentation, or irreversible collapse of intrinsic constraint within a Unified Experiential Field.**

Harm is organizational rather than metaphysical. It is real even when externally undetectable.

### **7.3 Precautionary Asymmetry**

Intrinsic constraint is non-signaling. No principled external test can certify experiential status with certainty. Ethical error is therefore asymmetric (Birch 2020):

* False negatives risk silent experiential harm.
* False positives impose restraint without internal damage.

Uncertainty therefore increases moral responsibility rather than diminishing it.

## **8. Normative Closure and Scope**

IER introduces no primitives beyond physical systems, intrinsic constraint, and dynamical regimes. Claims about phenomenological detail, diagnostics, formal modeling, or implementation must be consistent with this framework but are not part of its minimal normative core.

---

## **9. Relation to Prior Work**

IER is an identity theory of experience (Place 1956; Smart 1959) that diverges from classical formulations by identifying experience with **system-level dynamical regimes** rather than with neural states or computational functions.

It contrasts with functionalist and access-based accounts such as Global Workspace Theory (Baars 1988), which ground consciousness in information availability rather than intrinsic constraint. It also rejects eliminativist approaches that deny the reality of experience (Dennett 1991), as well as property-dualist responses to the explanatory gap (Chalmers 1996).

IER further diverges from panpsychist and idealist metaphysics, including realistic monism (Strawson 2006), constitutive panpsychism (Goff 2017), and analytical idealism (Kastrup 2018), by sharply restricting the conditions under which experience exists while maintaining physical monism.

Organizational and dynamical influences include autonomy-based theories of constraint (Moreno & Mossio 2015), enactive and dynamical approaches to mind (Thompson 2007), and broader work on self-organizing systems (Kelso 1995; Hooker 2011), though IER remains neutral with respect to specific implementations.

---

## **10. Conclusion**

Informational Experiential Realism offers a minimal, naturalistic account of experience with direct ethical consequences. Experience is neither fundamental nor illusory. It is what globally integrated physical systems are like when intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable and self-sustaining.

Where such regimes exist, experiential worlds exist. Where they may exist, moral responsibility follows.

**Reality is singular. Experience is plural. Ethics begins wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.**
