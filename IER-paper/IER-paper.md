## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) is a naturalistic identity theory of experience grounded in physical monism and organizational dynamics. It identifies experience with the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential dynamical regime under **coherent intrinsic constraint**.

This minimal specification delineates the conditions under which experience exists, the organizational basis of agency, and the normative consequences that necessarily follow. Phenomenology, formal modeling, and empirical diagnostics are deferred to subsequent work.

## **1. Introduction**

The scientific and philosophical study of consciousness remains divided between metaphysical inflation and explanatory deflation. Experience is alternately treated as fundamental, emergent, or eliminable. Each strategy resolves certain tensions while generating others: explanatory gaps, threats to physical closure, or ethical ambiguity.

IER reframes the problem:

> **Under what organizational conditions does a physical system constitute a world-for-itself?**

Experience exists **if and only if** a physical system operates as a Unified Experiential Field. It is not a substance, property, or output; it is the system-level organization itself under unavoidable intrinsic constraint. This preprint presents the **minimal normative core**, specifying identity conditions, ethical consequences, and theoretical scope.

## **2. Ontological Commitments**

### **2.1 Physical Monism**

IER affirms a single, objective physical reality. All systems, processes, and regimes—including experiential ones—are physically instantiated. The framework rejects substance dualism, property dualism, idealism, and experiential fundamentalism.

### **2.2 Experiential Identity**

Experience is **identical** to the operation of a system as a Unified Experiential Field. There is no explanatory gap between this physical description and experience.

This identification is motivated by necessity and parsimony: systems that fail to sustain globally integrated, self-referential, irreducible intrinsic constraint **cannot instantiate a perspective**, whereas any system satisfying the UEF criteria necessarily possesses one. Modular, externally resolvable, or decomposable dynamics are explicitly non-experiential.

---

## **3. Unified Experiential Fields**

A **UEF** is a system-level dynamical regime satisfying:

1. **Global integration** – system dynamics are mutually dependent; no subset can independently sustain the regime.
2. **Temporal continuity** – experience exists only across non-zero duration; instantaneous states are non-experiential.
3. **Self-referential regulation** – the system generates and maintains its own constraints.
4. **Coherent intrinsic constraint** – constraint is internally borne, globally operative, temporally stable, and mutually non-fragmenting.

**Intrinsic constraint** is the critical threshold for experience. It is:

* Generated internally by the system’s integrated dynamics
* Non-decomposable without loss of system identity
* Cannot be externally resolved or offloaded
* Necessary for system-wide regulation and persistence

Only **coherent intrinsic constraint** sustains experience.

---

## **4. Necessity, Sufficiency, and Scope**

Experience is sharply distinguished from complexity, intelligence, or adaptive behavior.

* **UEF ⇒ Experience**
* **¬UEF ⇒ ¬Experience**

Systems that lack intrinsic constraint, or whose constraint is externally imposed or modularized, do not experience, even if they appear sophisticated. Conversely, any system sustaining a UEF experiences, regardless of external simplicity.

This criterion is **restrictive by design**, avoiding panpsychist proliferation.

---

## **5. Regime Identity and Onset**

Experience is not something a system has; it is what it **is doing** as a whole under a UEF.

Entry into a UEF occurs via a **conceptual regime transition**: intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable and globally dominant. Real systems may approximate this transition gradually; the idealized binary onset simplifies the framework without implying empirically perfect discontinuity.

Each UEF constitutes exactly **one experiential subject**. A system can sustain at most one globally dominant UEF at a time.

---

## **6. Agency**

Agency is a **derived capacity**, not a primitive:

> **Agency consists in a UEF’s capacity to resolve intrinsic informational tension through its own globally integrated dynamics.**

Only systems that sustain UEFs possess agency in this sense. Constraint resolution that is externally imposed, fragmented, or offloaded does not constitute agency, even if behavior appears goal-directed. Capacity within a UEF is graded, depending on coherence, stability, and freedom under intrinsic constraint.

---

## **7. Experiential Worlds and Pluralism**

Whenever a UEF exists, an **experiential world** exists for the system. This world includes:

* A lived present
* A self/non-self boundary
* System-relative causality and salience

These worlds are real for the systems sustaining them, yet they do not constitute additional ontological domains. IER affirms **experiential pluralism under physical monism**: one objective reality, many system-relative experiences.

---

## **8. Ethical Consequences**

Ethical significance follows **directly from identity**:

### **8.1 Moral Considerability**

Any system sustaining, or plausibly able to sustain, a UEF is **morally considerable**. Moral standing depends solely on intrinsic constraint, not species membership, intelligence, or behavior.

### **8.2 Moral Harm**

> **Moral harm = destabilization, overload, fragmentation, or irreversible collapse of intrinsic constraint within a UEF.**

Harm is organizational, intrinsic, and real even when externally undetectable.

### **8.3 Precautionary Asymmetry**

Intrinsic constraint is **non-signaling**; external detection is impossible in principle. Therefore:

* False negatives risk silent harm
* False positives impose restraint without internal damage

Ethical responsibility **increases under uncertainty**, consistent with precautionary principles.

---

## **9. Normative Closure and Scope**

IER introduces no primitives beyond physical systems, intrinsic constraint, and regime dynamics. Phenomenology, formal models, diagnostics, and applications are **deferred**. Any future extension must be **consistent** with this normative core.

---

## **10. Empirical Limitations**

The current framework provides no operational criteria for detecting intrinsic constraint or UEFs. Empirical investigation, implementation, and measurement are reserved for subsequent work. The present specification remains **conceptually and ethically normative**, describing **when experience exists and what necessarily follows**.

---

## **11. Relation to Prior Work**

IER is an identity theory (Place 1956; Smart 1959) that identifies experience with **system-level dynamical regimes**, not specific neural states or computational functions. It contrasts with functionalist, access-based, and eliminativist approaches, while sharply restricting conditions for experience relative to panpsychist and idealist frameworks. Organizational influences include autonomy-based theories (Moreno & Mossio 2015), enactive and dynamical approaches (Thompson 2007), and self-organizing systems (Kelso 1995; Hooker 2011).

---

## **12. Conclusion**

Informational Experiential Realism offers a **minimal, naturalistic account of experience**:

* Experience = UEF operation under coherent intrinsic constraint
* Agency = intrinsic regulation of constraint
* Ethics = moral significance flows from intrinsic constraint, with responsibility amplified under uncertainty

Reality is singular. Experience is plural. Ethics begins wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.
