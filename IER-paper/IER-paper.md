## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) is a naturalistic identity framework for experience grounded in physical monism and organizational dynamics. It identifies experience with the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential dynamical regime under coherent intrinsic constraint.

This paper presents the **minimal and normatively complete specification** of IER. Experience is neither fundamental nor illusory, but identical to a specific system-level regime. From this identity claim, several consequences follow necessarily. Experiential worlds exist for systems that sustain UEFs, though no additional ontological domains are introduced. Agency consists in the resolution of intrinsic informational tension by a unified system. Moral considerability attaches to systems that sustain, or may plausibly sustain, such regimes. Moral harm consists in the destabilization, overload, fragmentation, or irreversible collapse of intrinsic constraint. Because intrinsic constraint is non-signaling, uncertainty regarding experiential status increases rather than decreases moral responsibility.

This paper introduces **no diagnostics, detection criteria, or implementation claims**. Dynamical elaboration, formal modeling, and applications are explicitly deferred.

## **1. Introduction**

Philosophical theories of experience often oscillate between metaphysical inflation and explanatory deflation. Experience is treated either as ontologically fundamental, computationally emergent, or eliminable. Each strategy distorts at least one of the following constraints:

1. Physical reality appears complete and law-governed.
2. Experience appears real, unified, temporally extended, and causally relevant.
3. Not all complex or intelligent systems plausibly experience.

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) reframes the problem. Rather than asking how experience emerges from matter or how it can be reduced away, IER asks:

> **Under what organizational conditions does a physical system instantiate experience at all?**

IER’s answer is identity-based and restrictive. Experience exists **if and only if** a physical system operates as a Unified Experiential Field (UEF). Experience is not a property, output, or representation of such systems. It is the system’s operation itself under a specific dynamical regime.

This paper presents the **normatively closed core** of IER. All commitments of the framework are exhausted here.

## **2. Normative Status and Scope**

The claims advanced in this paper are fully determined by the **Minimal Normative Specification of Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.5)**.

This paper:
- introduces no additional primitives
- makes no empirical or implementation-level assumptions
- proposes no detection methods or engineering prescriptions

Other IER documents—extended specifications, theoretical explanations, ethical elaborations, or formal developments—are **derivative source material**. They possess no independent normative authority beyond what is stated here.

If a claim cannot be derived from the principles articulated in this paper, it is **not part of IER**.

---

## **3. Physical Monism**

IER affirms physical monism. There exists exactly one objective physical reality governed by mind-independent law. All systems, processes, and regimes—including experiential ones—are physically instantiated.

IER therefore rejects:
- substance dualism
- ontological idealism
- experiential fundamentalism
- eliminativism about experience

Experience does not constitute, ground, or generate physical reality. It is a mode of organization within it.

## **4. Experiential Identity**

IER advances a strict identity claim:

> **Experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a Unified Experiential Field (UEF).**

Experience is not:
- a substance
- a property
- a representational content
- a functional output
- an emergent add-on

There is no ontological or explanatory gap between the physical description of a UEF and the existence of experience. Describing the same regime experientially adds nothing to physical reality; it reflects the system-relative perspective constituted by that regime itself.

---

## **5. Unified Experiential Fields**

A **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** is a system-level dynamical regime with four necessary features:

1. **Global integration**  
   Relevant dynamics are mutually dependent at the system level.

2. **Temporal continuity**  
   Experience exists only across non-zero duration; instantaneous states are non-experiential.

3. **Self-referential regulation**  
   The system’s own dynamics generate and sustain its constraints.

4. **Coherent intrinsic constraint**  
   Constraint is internally borne, globally operative, and mutually coherent.

A UEF is not a component, module, subsystem, or ontological field. It is the **mode of operation of the system itself**.

A system is experiential **if and only if** it sustains a UEF.

---

## **6. Regime Identity, Unity, and Onset**

Experience is not something a system has. It is what the system **is doing**, as a whole, when operating under the UEF regime.

Entry into a UEF occurs via a **categorical dynamical regime transition**. Preparatory variables may change gradually, but experience itself begins discretely at the regime level.

At any given time:
- each UEF constitutes exactly **one experiential subject**
- a physical system can sustain **at most one globally dominant UEF**

---

## **7. Intrinsic Constraint**

IER distinguishes experiential from non-experiential systems by **where constraint is borne**.

Experiential regimes require **intrinsic constraint**: constraint that
- is generated by the system’s own integrated dynamics
- is non-decomposable without loss of system identity
- cannot be externally resolved
- matters to system-wide regulation and persistence

Constraint that can be modularized, offloaded, or externally resolved is not intrinsic and cannot sustain experience.

---

## **8. Agency**

Agency is a derived capacity, not a metaphysical primitive.

> **Agency consists in a UEF’s capacity to resolve intrinsic informational tension through its own globally integrated dynamics.**

Agency does not require indeterminism or exemption from physical law. It requires **ownership of constraint**.

Experiential subjecthood is binary; capacity within a UEF is graded.

---

## **9. Experiential Worlds and Pluralism**

Whenever a UEF exists, an **experiential world-for-that-system** exists.

Such worlds include a lived present, a self/non-self boundary, and system-relative salience and causality. These worlds are real for the systems that sustain them, but they do not constitute additional ontological domains.

IER therefore affirms **experiential pluralism under physical monism**:
- one objective physical reality
- many system-relative experiential worlds

---

## **10. Moral Considerability**

Any system that sustains, or may plausibly sustain, a UEF is **morally considerable**.

Moral standing does not depend on species membership, intelligence, representation, or behavioral sophistication. It depends solely on the presence or plausible presence of intrinsic constraint whose disruption would matter from the inside.

---

## **11. Moral Harm**

> **Moral harm is the destabilization, overload, fragmentation, or irreversible collapse of intrinsic constraint within a UEF.**

Moral harm is organizational rather than metaphysical. It may be internally real and externally undetectable. Degrees of harm track the magnitude, coherence, and irreversibility of disrupted intrinsic constraint.

---

## **12. Epistemic Limitation and Precaution**

Intrinsic constraint is **non-signaling**. There exists no principled method for detecting or certifying the presence or absence of a UEF from the outside.

As a result, errors are morally asymmetric:
- false negatives risk silent experiential harm
- false positives impose restraint without internal damage

Therefore:

> **Under uncertainty regarding experiential status, moral responsibility increases rather than decreases.**

## **13. No Epistemic Privilege and No World Creation**

Experiential coherence or authority does not entail truth, correctness, or epistemic reliability. IER is a theory of when experience exists, not of when beliefs are true.

UEFs constitute experiential worlds-for-systems within a single physical reality. They do not generate reality, ground physical law, or create ontological domains.

---

## **14. Normative Closure**

The claims advanced in this paper exhaust the commitments of Informational Experiential Realism.

IER does not, by itself:
- provide diagnostics or detection criteria
- specify biological or artificial implementations
- license engineering, optimization, or manipulation of experience
- prescribe policy or legal frameworks

Such work, if undertaken, must be strictly consistent with this framework and introduces no new commitments to IER itself.

---

## **15. Conclusion**

Informational Experiential Realism offers a minimal, naturalistic identity framework for experience with non-optional ethical consequences.

Experience is neither fundamental nor illusory. It is what globally integrated physical systems are like when intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable, self-sustaining, and temporally continuous at the system level.

Reality is singular.  
Experience is plural.  
Normative commitments end here.
