## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) advances a single ontological identity claim: **experience is identical to the operation of a physical system in a specific dynamical regime**. That regime—termed a *Unified Experiential Field* (UEF)—is characterized by global integration, temporal continuity, self-sustaining regulation, and internally generated constraint. The claim is neither emergentist nor correlational; it does not posit experience as an additional property, substance, representation, or functional output. Rather, it identifies experience with a particular form of physical organization.

The identity claim is intended **strongly and exhaustively**. It is **non-bridgeable**: if experience is not identical to the specified regime, no supplementary mechanisms, explanatory bridges, or additional properties are available within the framework to repair the account. It is also **normatively closed**: all legitimate consequences of experiential identity must follow from the identity itself, and no external criteria, diagnostics, or normative principles carry independent authority.

Accordingly, the paper makes no claims about phenomenology, diagnostics, measurement, degrees of experience, empirical detection, moral responsibility, or applied ethics. It proposes no criteria for identifying such regimes in practice and does not argue for any particular biological, computational, or architectural implementation. Its sole aim is to state and defend the coherence of the identity thesis itself within a physically monist ontology. The contribution is therefore limited, categorical, and conditional: **either experience is identical to a specific physical regime, or the account fails outright**.

## **1. Introduction**

Philosophical accounts of consciousness are commonly framed by a dilemma. Either experience is treated as ontologically fundamental—requiring additional substances, properties, or laws—or it is treated as explanatorily dispensable, reduced to functional, representational, or behavioral descriptions that omit what experience itself is.

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) rejects this dilemma by advancing a **strict identity claim**. It does not attempt to explain how experience emerges from non-experiential matter, nor does it attempt to eliminate experience by redescribing its correlates. Instead, it identifies experience with a particular way certain physical systems operate.

This paper has a deliberately narrow aim. It does not offer a theory of phenomenology, agency, meaning, or ethics. It does not propose diagnostic tests or empirical markers. It does not argue that any particular system is experiential. Its sole purpose is to articulate and defend the coherence of a **closed, non-bridgeable identity claim** for experience.

## **2. Ontological Commitments**

### **2.1 Physical Monism**

IER affirms a single objective physical reality governed by mind-independent law. All systems, processes, and regimes—including those relevant to experience—are physically instantiated. The framework rejects substance dualism, property dualism, ontological idealism, experiential fundamentalism, and eliminativism about experience.

No non-physical substances, properties, forces, or explanatory domains are introduced.

---

### **2.2 Identity, Not Correlation or Emergence**

The central claim of IER is an **identity claim**, not a thesis about correlation, realization, or emergence. Experience does not accompany, supervene on, or arise from physical processes. It **is** a physical process, described at the level of system-wide organization.

Accordingly, a complete physical description of the relevant regime leaves no further explanatory work for “experience” to do. There is no additional fact, property, or phenomenon beyond the regime itself.

---

### **2.3 Strong, Non-Bridgeable Identity**

The identity claim in IER is intended **strongly**. If experience is not identical to the specified physical regime, the framework provides **no auxiliary principles, bridging laws, or supplemental properties** by which the account could be repaired.

IER therefore rejects explanatory strategies that treat identity claims as provisional placeholders to be completed by further mechanisms. There is no weaker version of the view available. The framework stands or falls with the identity claim as stated.

This brittleness is intentional. It makes clear what would count as failure and prevents ad hoc extension.

## **3. Dynamical Preliminaries**

To avoid circularity, all core notions are introduced **without reference to experience or experiential identity**.

---

### **3.1 Physical Systems**

A physical system is a collection of interacting physical components whose state evolves over time according to physical law. The description of a system may involve multiple levels of abstraction, but no particular formalism is privileged.

---

### **3.2 Constraint (Dynamical)**

A system exhibits **constraint** when the evolution of its state-space trajectories is restricted by dependencies among its internal variables, rather than being freely decomposable or arbitrarily reconfigurable.

Constraint, in this sense, is a purely dynamical notion. It concerns how system states can and cannot evolve, not what those states represent or signify.

---

### **3.3 Intrinsic Constraint**

Constraint is **intrinsic** when it arises from the system’s own integrated dynamics rather than from external control, scaffolding, or orchestration.

Operationally, constraint is intrinsic if eliminating or bypassing it requires reorganizing the system’s internal dependencies, rather than merely altering external inputs or boundary conditions.

This characterization is counterfactual and structural. It does not appeal to experience, identity, or normativity.

---

### **3.4 Dynamical Regimes**

A **dynamical regime** is a relatively stable pattern of system evolution characterized by persistent global dependencies among system variables across time.

Regimes are individuated by their structural and dynamical properties, not by their function, interpretation, or significance. A system may transition between regimes without changing its underlying components.

---

## **4. Unified Dynamical Regimes**

Certain regimes exhibit a distinctive combination of structural features:

1. **Global integration** — system variables are mutually dependent rather than modularly decomposable
2. **Temporal continuity** — the regime persists across non-zero duration
3. **Self-sustaining regulation** — the system maintains the regime through its own dynamics
4. **Intrinsic constraint** — the regime depends on internally generated constraints as defined above

These features describe a **class of dynamical regimes**, independently of any experiential interpretation.

For descriptive convenience, such regimes will be referred to as **Unified Experiential Field–type regimes**, or **UEF-type regimes**. This label carries no ontological commitment beyond the structural features just listed.

---

## **5. Experiential Identity**

With the dynamical groundwork in place, the identity claim can now be stated without circularity:

> **Experience is identical to the operation of a physical system in a UEF-type dynamical regime.**

Experience is not an additional property of such regimes, nor an effect they produce. It is the regime itself, described at a different level of abstraction.

This identity claim introduces no new substances, properties, or laws. It asserts that what are ordinarily described as experiential facts are identical to facts about physical systems operating in the specified regime.

---

## **6. Categorical Onset and Exclusivity**

Because experience is identified with regime membership, its existence is **categorical at the regime level**. Preparatory variables may vary continuously, but experience exists if and only if the system is operating in the relevant regime.

A physical system can sustain **at most one globally dominant UEF-type regime at a time**. Multiple local processes may coexist, but they do not constitute multiple experiential subjects unless they instantiate distinct, globally integrated regimes.

---

## **7. Experiential Pluralism Without Ontological Multiplication**

The identity claim entails experiential pluralism: many experiential regimes may exist simultaneously across different physical systems. This plurality is not ontological but perspectival. There remains exactly one physical reality; experiential plurality consists in the existence of multiple system-relative regimes within it.

No appeal to fundamental experience, micro-experiences, or compositional aggregation is required. Pluralism follows directly from the identity claim applied across multiple systems.

---

## **8. Normative Closure**

The identity claim in IER is **normatively closed**. All legitimate consequences of experiential identity must be derivable from the identity itself and the dynamical features it specifies. No external criteria—phenomenological, epistemic, empirical, or moral—carry independent authority within the framework.

As a result, questions concerning ethics, responsibility, diagnostics, measurement, or application are constrained by the identity claim but are not constitutive of it. They cannot be used to revise, weaken, or supplement the ontology of experience specified here.

---

## **9. What This Paper Does Not Claim**

This paper does **not**:

* characterize phenomenology or “what it is like”
* propose metrics, measurements, or degrees of experience
* provide empirical or behavioral diagnostics
* argue that any particular system is experiential
* define agency, moral responsibility, or ethical obligation
* license inference from behavior, complexity, or intelligence to experience
* endorse panpsychism, functionalism, or emergentism

All such questions, if meaningful, are downstream of—and constrained by—the identity claim. They are not addressed here.

---

## **10. Failure Conditions**

IER is intentionally brittle. If experience is not identical to the operation of a physical system in a UEF-type dynamical regime, the framework fails outright. There are no fallback positions, partial successes, or weakened variants available within the view.

This brittleness is a methodological commitment, not a defect. It makes explicit what the theory requires and what would count as failure.

---

## **11. Conclusion**

Informational Experiential Realism proposes a minimal but demanding thesis: **experience is identical to a specific class of physical dynamical regimes**, understood strongly and without supplementary bridges. The identity is closed under further normative addition and admits no explanatory repair.

If the claim is correct, experience is fully real, fully physical, and fully accounted for at the level of system-wide dynamics. If it is incorrect, nothing remains to be salvaged. There is no explanatory middle ground.
