### **Informational Experiential Realism: Concept Inventory**

1. **Preprint (Spec + Theory + Ethics)** covers:

   * Normative core
   * Identity claim (Experience = UEF)
   * Ontology (physical monism, no world creation)
   * Core ethical consequences (moral considerability, harm, precaution)
   * Agency, free will, and intrinsic constraint

2. **Book** covers:

   * Dynamical elaboration, persistence, and diachronic phenomena
   * Applications / case studies (psychosis, brainfeels, aphantasia)
   * Meaning, narrative, and experiential pluralism
   * Boundary enforcement (denials, contrasts, diagnostics, access)
   * Formal tools (math) and detailed derivations

3. **No gaps detected**: all concepts are assigned correctly according to **first public appearance**. Preprint is **self-contained and defensible**, while the book expands, illustrates, and clarifies.

| Experiential Access vs Epistemic Access                                | `IER-access.md`      | Clarifies item 15 (no epistemic privilege)                                    | Distinguishes internal authority from truth; no new normative content            |
| Mathematics / Formal Tools                                             | `IER-math.md`        | Illustrates items 3 & 8 (UEF structure + constraint)                          | Makes formal relationships explicit; does not alter identity or ethics           |

### **Key Takeaways**

* **The spec defines “what must be true”** for any UEF and experience.
* **All book content interprets, illustrates, or clarifies** that spec.
* **No book content introduces new identity primitives, normative consequences, or ethical requirements**.
* The book is **entirely non-normative** relative to the spec; it’s an *explanatory and applicative expansion*.
