# 2. Mapping: **IER-Theory → Distilled Manuscript**

The Theory document is explanatory and non-normative.

## Intentionally Deferred (Correctly)

| Theory Material                   | Where It Goes |
| --------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Psychosis / dreaming / anesthesia | Book          |

# 3. Mapping: **IER-Ethics → Distilled Manuscript**

The Ethics document derives consequences from the Spec.
**All ethical claims are present in compressed normative form.**

## Deferred (Correctly)

| Ethics Content                | Status              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Animals / plants / ecosystems | Book                |

# Final Verdict

**Yes — the distilled manuscript fully contains the entire conceptual content of:**

* **IER-specification**
* **IER-theory**
* **IER-ethics**

with:

* ✔ no missing axioms
* ✔ no weakened identity claims
* ✔ no ethical dilution
* ✔ no hidden new primitives

What changes is **presentation density**, not substance.
