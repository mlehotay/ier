# **Part V — Agency and Ethics**
## **Responsibility Under Intrinsic Constraint**

If experience is real by identity, ethics follows **necessarily**, not optionally.

This part derives an account of:

* agency as constraint-owned causation
* free will without metaphysical freedom
* moral harm as organizational damage
* responsibility as graded
* standing as categorical

IER rejects both:

* moral inflation grounded in phenomenology, and
* moral deflation grounded in uncertainty

Instead, it shows why:

* intrinsic constraint grounds ethical relevance
* uncertainty **increases**, rather than decreases, obligation
* participation modulation affects moral risk without altering standing

Ethics here is not a moral theory layered onto experience.
It is what follows once experience is taken seriously as a physical fact.
