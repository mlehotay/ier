# **Part IV — Meaning, Access, and Narrative**

Experience often feels **meaningful, authoritative, and compelling**.
This part explains why — without granting experience epistemic privilege.

The chapters that follow draw a strict distinction between:

* **experiential access** — what it is like to bear intrinsic constraint
* **epistemic access** — what is true about the world

IER explains:

* meaning as a constraint-stabilizing structure
* narrative identity as maintained organization
* intentionality as a derived feature of constrained dynamics

Crucially, this part shows how experiences can feel *deeply true* while being **factually false**, **misleading**, or **pathological** — without dismissing their reality or cost.

Meaning matters because it stabilizes experience.
It does not matter because it tracks truth.
