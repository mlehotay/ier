# **IER Publishing (v10.8.1)**

## **Publication Strategy, Format Discipline, and Execution Checklist**

---

## **Status and Purpose**

This document defines the **publication strategy, production constraints, format decisions, and execution tasks** governing the dissemination of the **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** corpus.

It introduces **no ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical claims**.

It governs **how the corpus is packaged, rendered, distributed, and maintained as a public artifact**, not what the theory asserts.

This document is **procedural and operational**, not canon-authoritative.

---

## **Scope of Authority**

This document governs:

* print and digital formats
* layout and typographic constraints
* distribution channels
* version-to-edition mapping
* production sequencing
* maintenance obligations post-publication

This document does **not**:

* modify canon authority
* alter interpretive constraints
* introduce pedagogical commitments
* determine reading order (see `IER-Manifest.md`)
* revise book structure (see `IER-book.md`)

---

## **Publishing Goals**

IER publication aims to:

* preserve **theoretical precision**
* maintain **reader alignment**
* signal **technical seriousness**
* avoid aesthetic dilution
* minimize interpretive drift across formats

IER is not optimized for:

* mass-market accessibility
* motivational framing
* persuasion-by-style
* brand aesthetics

---

## **Target Publication Identity**

### **Primary Identity**

IER is published as a:

> **Single technical monograph / conceptual reference work**

It is **one physical book**, not a multi-volume set.

The book contains **two internal divisions** with different structural roles, as defined in `IER-book.md`.

---

### **Structural Signal Requirements**

The published artifact must make clear—through layout, headings, and front matter—that:

* the book contains **Division A: The Closed Argument**
* followed by **Division B: The Complete Corpus**
* Division B **presupposes** Division A
* no foundational claims are restated after Division A

Design and layout choices are **interpretive signals**, not neutral aesthetics.

---

## **Primary Print Format (Normative Target)**

### **Trim Size**

* Preferred: **7 × 9 in** (technical paperback standard)
* Acceptable alternates:

  * 6.875 × 9.25
  * 7.5 × 9.25

Consistency across printings is preferred.

---

### **Typography Constraints**

* Serif body font
* High word density
* Tight leading
* Minimal paragraph spacing
* Functional headings only
* Explicit tier markers in chapter headers

Typography must not imply:

* casual reading
* motivational pacing
* narrative authority
* pedagogical sequencing

---

### **Page Density Targets**

* Target: **350–450 words per page**
* Acceptable variance allowed for:

  * diagrams
  * lists
  * definitions
  * block quotations

Page inflation for comfort is discouraged.

---

## **Division-Specific Layout Discipline**

### **Division A — The Closed Argument**

Layout priorities:

* uninterrupted argument flow
* minimal navigational scaffolding
* no pedagogical callouts
* no reader-reassurance inserts
* section breaks aligned strictly to dependency order

Division A must read as:

> **compact, unavoidable, and closed**

---

### **Division B — The Complete Corpus**

Layout priorities:

* reference usability
* strong running headers indicating:

  * Division
  * Part
  * Tier
* explicit cross-references to Division A Parts
* visible tier markers on every chapter
* heavier reliance on index and glossary

Division B must read as:

> **dependent, constrained, and non-authoritative**

---

## **Digital Formats**

### **PDF (Canonical Digital Format)**

* Canonical digital reference
* Must match print pagination exactly
* Used for citation, review, and archival reference
* Page numbers must restart **only once** (single book)

---

### **EPUB / HTML (Optional)**

* Secondary to print/PDF
* Must preserve:

  * division boundaries
  * part ordering
  * tier markers
* Must not introduce:

  * reordered content
  * adaptive pedagogy
  * summaries
  * collapsible “learning paths”

---

## **Versioning and Edition Mapping**

### **Version vs. Edition**

* **Version** = normative authority (see `IER-canon.md`)
* **Edition** = physical or digital rendering of that version

A single version may have:

* multiple printings
* multiple formats (print / PDF / EPUB)

All editions must map unambiguously to a single version.

---

### **Pagination Discipline**

Because the book is a **single bound volume**:

* pagination is continuous across both divisions
* citations must specify:

  * version
  * division
  * part
  * chapter
  * page number

Example citation format:

> IER v10.8.1, Div. A, Part III, Ch. 12, p. 417

---

### **Patch Publication Discipline**

Patch-level publishing may include:

* typo fixes
* layout corrections
* cross-reference clarity
* index improvements
* glossary clarifications

Patch publication must **not**:

* add new chapters
* reorder content
* alter division boundaries
* introduce new claims
* restate foundational material

Pagination changes must be documented.

---

## **ISBN, Imprint, and Attribution**

The book uses:

* **one ISBN** per physical format
* **one imprint identity**
* **one authorial attribution**

Checklist items:

* ISBN assignment
* imprint name
* copyright notice
* licensing statement (if any)

Attribution must preserve:

* authorial responsibility
* corpus integrity
* version traceability

---

## **Distribution Channels**

### **Primary**

* Print-on-demand (trade paperback)
* Direct PDF distribution

---

### **Secondary (Optional)**

* Libraries
* Academic bookstores
* Online retailers

IER does not optimize for algorithmic discoverability or recommendation systems.

---

## **Reader Orientation Obligations**

Published editions must include:

* a clear **status and scope notice**
* an explicit **non-reader-hostile framing**
* an orientation explaining:

  * why constraints exist
  * what the work is *not*
  * how to read without misuse
  * how Division A and Division B differ

Orientation is mandatory but **non-normative**.

---

## **Maintenance Obligations**

Post-publication responsibilities include:

* errata tracking
* clarification patches
* reader confusion triage
* cross-format consistency checks

Maintenance must preserve:

* canonical authority
* tier discipline
* reader good faith
* structural clarity between divisions

---

## **Non-Goals (Explicit)**

IER publishing does not aim to:

* persuade skeptics
* simplify core claims
* soften ethical consequences
* optimize for casual readability
* compete stylistically with popular nonfiction
* allow Division B to be read or marketed as a substitute for Division A

Clarity is pursued **without dilution**.

---

## **Summary**

IER publishing is governed by:

* single-book discipline
* division-aware layout
* density-preserving design
* version integrity
* reader alignment without softening
* explicit separation of theory from packaging

The goal is not comfort.

The goal is **faithful transmission of a hard claim in a durable form**.
