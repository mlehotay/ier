# **IER Publishing (v10.8.2)**

## **Publication Strategy, Format Discipline, and Execution Rules**

---

## **Status and Purpose**

This document defines the **publication and production rules** governing dissemination of the
**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** corpus.

It introduces **no ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical claims**.

It governs **how the book is rendered, packaged, and maintained**, not what the theory asserts.

Public release sequencing is governed by `IER-deployment.md`.

---

## **Dependency Order (Authoritative)**

This document is strictly subordinate to:

1. **`IER-canon.md`** — authority and governance  
2. **`IER-manifest.md`** — corpus membership and flat ordering  
3. **`IER-book.md`** — book structure, Parts, and reader-facing scope  

This document **must not**:
- define book structure
- redefine corpus membership
- override Part boundaries
- introduce interpretive rules

If any conflict appears, **`IER-book.md` takes precedence** for book-related questions.

---

## **Book Identity**

IER is published as:

> **A single-volume technical monograph**

The book has **three Parts**, defined exclusively in `IER-book.md`:

* **Part I — The IER Theory Proper**
* **Part II — Applications, Elaborations, and Boundaries**
* **Part III — Orientation, Context, and Navigation**

No other structural divisions are permitted.

---

## **Authority and Dependency Discipline**

### **Normative Authority**

Exactly one document is normatively authoritative:

> **`IER-specification.md`**

All book chapters—including ethics, applications, and orientation—are **non-authoritative**.

### **Part Dependencies**

* **Part I** is foundational and normatively sufficient.
* **Part II** presupposes Part I in full and introduces no new foundations.
* **Part III** is reader-facing orientation only and carries no authority.

Layout, headings, and navigational signals must reinforce these dependencies.

---

## **Primary Print Format (Normative Target)**

### **Trim Size**
* Preferred: **7 × 9 in**
* Acceptable alternates:
  * 6.875 × 9.25
  * 7.5 × 9.25

### **Paper**
* **White paper only**

### **Typography**
* Serif body font
* High word density
* Tight leading
* Minimal paragraph spacing
* Functional headings only

Typography must not signal:
- pedagogy
- narrative pacing
- motivational framing

---

## **Mathematical and Formal Expression Discipline**

* Display equations when non-trivial
* Number equations only when cross-referenced
* No decorative math styling

Formal elements must signal **necessity**, not instruction.

---

## **Tables**

* Tables are first-class information carriers
* Reduced font size permitted
* Minimal ruling
* Page breaks allowed with continuity labels

---

## **Diagrams**

* Maximum: **two diagrams total**
* Black-and-white only
* Vector-based
* Captioned, not narrated

---

## **Page Density Targets**

* Target: **350–450 words per page**
* Variance allowed for tables, equations, diagrams

---

## **Digital Formats**

### **PDF (Canonical Digital Edition)**

* Matches print pagination exactly
* Used for citation and archival reference
* Single continuous pagination across all Parts

### **EPUB / HTML (Secondary)**

* Must preserve:
  * Part boundaries
  * Chapter ordering
  * Non-authoritative status of Part III
* Must not introduce:
  * reordering
  * summaries
  * adaptive reading paths

---

## **Versioning and Edition Mapping**

* **Version** = theoretical authority (e.g., v10.8.2)
* **Edition** = physical or digital rendering

All editions map to **exactly one version**.

---

## **Patch Discipline**

Permitted:
- typographical corrections
- layout fixes
- index and glossary improvements

Not permitted:
- new chapters
- reordered content
- restated foundations
- authority changes

---

## **ISBN, Attribution, and Disclosure**

* One ISBN per physical format
* Single authorial attribution
* AI assistance disclosure optional and non-authorial

---

## **Reader Orientation Obligations**

Published editions must include:

* clear Part labeling
* explicit authority disclaimers
* a visible transition into Part III

Orientation must not imply interpretive authority.

## **Summary**

`IER-publishing.md` defines **how the book is rendered**, not **what the book is**.

Book structure is defined **only** in `IER-book.md`.
Corpus membership is defined **only** in `IER-manifest.md`.
Authority is fixed **only** in `IER-canon.md`.

This document exists to prevent drift—not to introduce judgment.
