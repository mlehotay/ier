# **Part II — Phenomenology**
## **The Breadth of Unified Experiential Fields**

This part demonstrates the **explanatory reach** of the IER identity claim across diverse forms of lived experience.

The goal is not to *found* the theory on phenomenology, but to show that a **single organizational identity** can account for:

* affect and emotion
* internally generated qualitative patterns
* atypical experiential architectures
* aesthetic and artistic experience

Phenomenology here functions as **proof of principle**:

* many experiential forms
* one underlying identity
* no additional primitives

These chapters introduce **no new criteria** for experience.
They illustrate how different qualitative structures arise from different organizations of intrinsic constraint within an already-existing UEF.

The diversity of experience is treated as a consequence of structure, not a challenge to unity.
