# **Part II — Applications, Elaborations, and Boundaries**

All material in this part **presupposes Part I in full**.

The chapters that follow:

* introduce **no new identity claims**
* introduce **no criteria, thresholds, or sufficiency conditions**
* introduce **no additional ethical principles**
* do **not** reopen or revise the closed argument

Part II applies, elaborates, stress-tests, and constrains the identity claim fixed in Part I across phenomenology, time, meaning, agency, and ethical cases.

Nothing in this part modifies what experience is, when it exists, or what necessarily follows from its existence.
