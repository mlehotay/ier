## Version

**IER Book Version:** v10.8.2  
**Date:** January 2026

This version reflects:

- A finalized **three-Part book structure**
- Inclusion of a **Preface derived from IER-paper**
- Manifest-driven exhaustiveness over reader-facing corpus material
- Removal of all legacy “two-part” or “division” language

---

## What This Book Is

This book is a **compiled reader-facing artifact** of the *Informational Experiential Realism (IER)* project.

It is:

- A **structured presentation** of the IER theory, its applications, and its orientation materials
- **Exhaustive** over all reader-facing documents listed in **Manifest Parts I–III**
- Organized into **three Parts**, each with a distinct functional role

The book is **not** a governance document, a publication policy, or a living specification.

---

## What This Book Is Not

This book is **not**:

- A definition of canon or authority
- A governance or policy document
- A publication or licensing specification
- A selective anthology or curated subset
- A revisionary or argumentative layer over the corpus

All authority and interpretive constraints originate outside this artifact.

---

## Structure of the Book

The book consists of the following major components, in build order:

1. **Front Matter** (this file)
2. **Preface**  
   Derived from *IER-paper*  
   Non-authoritative, explanatory, and motivational in nature
3. **Part I — The IER Theory Proper**  
   Foundational identity claims and necessary conditions
4. **Part II — Applications, Elaborations, and Boundaries**  
   Derivative applications and extensions that presuppose Part I
5. **Part III — Orientation, Context, and Navigation**  
   Non-authoritative guidance and reader orientation

No other Parts, divisions, or structural layers are permitted.

---

## The Preface

The Preface is derived from **IER-paper** and appears **before Part I**.

The Preface:

- Provides motivation, context, and framing
- Introduces the problem space and perspective of IER
- Carries **no independent theoretical authority**
- Does not define identity claims, criteria, or commitments

All authoritative claims begin in **Part I**.

---

## Intended Audience

This book is written for:

- Readers seeking a **complete, coherent presentation** of IER
- Readers engaging with IER as a theory, not as a policy framework
- Readers who require a stable, versioned reference artifact

It assumes no prior familiarity with IER, but it does assume careful reading.

---

## Reading Guidance

- **Part I** is normatively and conceptually foundational.  
  All later material presupposes it.
- **Part II** applies and explores consequences of Part I without revising it.
- **Part III** provides orientation only and may be read selectively.

Failure of Part I entails failure of the project as a whole.

AI-assisted authorship are discussed in **`IER-legal.md`**.

`IER-legal.md` does **not** define the structure, authority, or content of
