**Version:** v10.6
**Edition:** Book Version 0 (Internal / Working Draft)
**Status:** Normatively Closed; Explanatorily Extended
**Date:** December 2025

## **Status, Scope, and Authority**

This book presents **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.6)** as a unified theoretical framework for understanding experience, phenomenology, meaning, agency, and ethics within a strictly physicalist ontology.

### **Normative Authority**

Exactly **one document** is normatively authoritative:

> **`IER-specification.md` (v10.6)**

The Specification defines **exhaustively and exclusively**:

* what experience **is**
* when experience **exists**
* what **necessarily follows** from its existence, including ethical consequences

All other chapters in this book — including theory, dynamics, mathematics, phenomenology, and ethics — are **non-normative**. They introduce:

* no new primitives
* no thresholds or criteria
* no independent necessity claims
* no additional ethical principles

If any statement in this book appears to conflict with the Specification, **the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

This book is therefore an **integrated presentation**, not a second authority.

## **What This Book Is**

This book is:

* a **coherent narrative presentation** of IER v10.6
* an integration of its conceptual, formal, phenomenological, and ethical consequences
* a guide for readers engaging with the theory as a whole rather than as isolated papers

It is intended to make the structure and implications of IER **legible, navigable, and usable**, without reopening or revising its normative core.

---

## **What This Book Is Not**

This book is **not**:

* a revision of the IER Specification
* a proposal of new metaphysical commitments
* a diagnostic or detection framework
* a phenomenological foundation for experience
* an empirical theory of neuroscience or psychology
* a claim that experience can be measured, certified, or optimized

IER is an **identity theory**, not a construction manual.

---

## **Version 0 Notice**

This is **Book Version 0**.

That means:

* All core theoretical content reflects **IER v10.6** and is conceptually complete.
* Several chapters serve as **connective or architectural bridges** rather than full expositions.
* Placeholder chapters are **explicitly marked** and intentionally short.
* The purpose of this edition is **integration, review, and feedback**, not polish.

Future editions may expand, refine, or reorganize presentation, but **will not alter the normative core** unless the Specification itself is revised.

## **How to Read This Book**

IER has a strict internal architecture. Readers are encouraged **not to skip directly to applications or ethics** without understanding the identity claim.

### **Recommended Reading Path**

1. **Part I – Foundations**
   Establishes the identity of experience as a Unified Experiential Field (UEF) under intrinsic constraint.

2. **Part II – Phenomenology**
   Demonstrates explanatory power across diverse experiential forms.

3. **Part III – Time and Continuity**
   Extends experiential identity across interruption, learning, and change.

4. **Part IV – Meaning and Access**
   Explains why experience feels meaningful and authoritative without granting epistemic privilege.

5. **Part V – Agency and Ethics**
   Derives responsibility, harm, and precaution from experiential identity.

6. **Part VI – Extensions and Limits**
   Enforces boundaries and clarifies what IER does not claim.

Readers interested only in the formal core should read **Chapter 5 (Normative Specification)** directly, but should be aware that later chapters assume its commitments.

## **Key Commitments (Non-Negotiable)**

IER v10.6 affirms that:

* There exists exactly **one objective physical reality**
* Experience is **real**, **physical**, and **categorical**
* Experience is **identical** to a specific organizational and dynamical regime
* That regime is called a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**
* Experiential subjecthood is **binary**, not graded
* Participation modulates **content**, not **existence**
* Moral harm is **organizational**, not phenomenological
* Uncertainty about experience **increases**, rather than decreases, ethical responsibility

Everything in this book exists to clarify or apply these claims — not to add to them.

## **A Note on Tone and Method**

This book deliberately avoids:

* appeals to intuition as authority
* metaphysical inflation
* experiential mysticism
* reductive dismissal
* diagnostic ambition

Phenomenology is treated as **demonstration**, not foundation.
Mathematics is treated as **structural interpretation**, not definition.
Ethics is treated as **entailed consequence**, not overlay.

---

## **Reader Feedback**

This edition is intended for:

* careful readers
* critical collaborators
* interdisciplinary reviewers

Feedback is most useful when it addresses:

* internal coherence
* boundary enforcement
* unintended implications
* clarity of distinctions

Feedback that proposes new primitives, thresholds, or diagnostic criteria is out of scope unless accompanied by a proposed revision to the Specification itself.

---

## **Summary**

> **Experience is what globally integrated physical systems are like when intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable, self-sustaining, and temporally continuous.**

Reality is singular.
Experience is plural.
Ethics begins wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.
