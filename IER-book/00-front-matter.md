# **Informational Experiential Realism**
## **Experience as Physical Identity**

**Version:** v10.8.1  
**Status:** Normatively Closed  
**Form:** Single-Volume Book

---

## **Status, Scope, and Authority**

This book presents **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.1)** as a unified account of:

* what experience **is**
* when experience **exists**
* what **necessarily follows** from its existence

IER is a **physicalist identity theory**.  
It does not treat experience as a substance, property, representation, output, or emergent accompaniment.

### **Normative Authority**

Exactly **one document** is normatively authoritative:

> **`IER-specification.md` (v10.8.1)**

The Specification defines **exhaustively and exclusively**:

* the identity of experience
* the conditions under which experience exists
* the ethical consequences that follow necessarily from that identity

All other material in this book — including theory, dynamics, mathematics, phenomenology, applications, and ethical discussion — is **non-normative**.

These chapters:

* introduce **no new primitives**
* introduce **no criteria, thresholds, or sufficiency conditions**
* introduce **no independent necessity claims**
* introduce **no additional ethical principles**

If any statement in this book appears to conflict with the Specification, **the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

This book is therefore an **integrated presentation**, not a second authority.

## **What This Book Is**

This book is:

* a **single, coherent presentation** of Informational Experiential Realism
* an assembly of its explanatory structure, applications, and boundaries
* a guide to understanding how the identity claim behaves across phenomena

It is written for readers engaging with IER as a **complete framework**, rather than as isolated papers.

Nothing in this book reopens, revises, or weakens the normative core fixed by the Specification.

---

## **What This Book Is Not**

This book is **not**:

* a revision of the IER Specification
* a proposal of new metaphysical commitments
* a phenomenological foundation for experience
* a diagnostic, detection, or certification framework
* an empirical theory of neuroscience or psychology
* a guide to engineering, optimizing, or measuring experience

IER is an **identity theory**, not a construction manual.

## **Structure of the Book**

The book is divided into two conceptual parts.

### **Part I — The IER Theory Proper**

Part I fixes the identity of experience and its necessary consequences.

It establishes:

* experience as identical to a specific physical regime
* Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs) as the sole bearers of experience
* intrinsic constraint as the basis of unity, continuity, and moral standing
* the impossibility of diagnostics and experiential certification

Part I is **normatively sufficient** and **structurally closed**.

If the identity claim fails, everything that follows fails with it.

---

### **Part II — Applications, Elaborations, and Boundaries**

Part II presupposes Part I **in full**.

It:

* applies the identity claim across phenomenology, time, meaning, agency, and ethics
* demonstrates explanatory reach without adding foundations
* enforces limits, exclusions, and non-claims
* explores consequences without reopening the theory

Nothing in Part II revises, extends, or competes with the commitments fixed in Part I.

---

## **How to Read This Book**

IER has a strict internal architecture.

Readers are strongly encouraged **not to skip directly to applications or ethics** without understanding the identity claim.

Those interested only in the formal core should read **Part I in sequence**.

Later chapters assume familiarity with its definitions, exclusions, and constraints.

---

## **Summary**

> **Experience is what globally integrated physical systems are like when intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable, self-sustaining, and temporally continuous at the system level.**

Reality is singular.  
Experience is plural.  
Ethical significance begins wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.
