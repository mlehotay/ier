# **IER Deployment and Release Policy (v10.8.2)**

## **Status and Scope**

This document defines the **public deployment order** and **release discipline** for the Informational Experiential Realism (IER) corpus and its derived artifacts.

It governs:

* sequencing of public releases
* priority anchoring
* immutability expectations
* cross-artifact framing obligations

It does **not**:

* define theory
* define book structure
* define rendering or production rules
* introduce interpretive authority

This document is subordinate to:

1. `IER-canon.md`
2. `IER-manifest.md`
3. `IER-book.md`

## **1. Deployment Principles**

### 1.1 Anchor Before Interface

Authoritative or exhaustive artifacts must be publicly anchored **before** derivative or interface-facing summaries are released.

This prevents:

* retroactive reframing
* “draft aura” misclassification
* authority inversion

---

### 1.2 Artifact Immutability on Release

Once an artifact is publicly released:

* its contents are treated as immutable
* corrections require a new edition or version
* silent replacement is prohibited

---

## **2. Canonical Deployment Order (v10.8.2)**

### **Step 1 — Book Release (Edition 0.1)**

The first public release is:

* **IER Book, Edition 0.1**
* derived mechanically from IER v10.8.2
* published via **Amazon KDP**

This release:

* establishes a public timestamp
* anchors pagination and citation
* fixes the book artifact as a reference object

Edition numbering reflects **physical rendering**, not theoretical maturity.

---

### **Step 2 — Paper Release (Preprint)**

After the book is public, a paper may be released on:

* **Open Science Framework**
* **PhilSci Archive**

The paper must be framed as:

* a **condensed exposition**
* a **summary interface**
* a **non-authoritative presentation**

The paper must not:

* redefine theory
* introduce new commitments
* claim priority over the book

---

## **3. Cross-Artifact Framing Rules**

### 3.1 Book → Paper

The book may state:

> *A condensed paper presentation is forthcoming on public preprint servers.*

No further promises or dependencies are required.

---

### 3.2 Paper → Book

The paper must state:

> *This paper summarizes a publicly available technical monograph (IER Book, Edition 0.1).*

The book is the reference object.

---

## **4. Relationship to Publishing and Build Plans**

* Rendering constraints are governed by `IER-publishing.md`
* Structural derivation is governed by the Master Build & Governance Plan (v10.8.2)
* Deployment does not modify build inputs or outputs

Deployment order does **not** affect:

* manifest membership
* canonical authority
* validation rules

---

## **5. Rationale (Non-Normative)**

This deployment order:

* fixes priority cleanly
* avoids draft signaling
* preserves authority directionality
* allows papers to evolve without destabilizing the monograph

---

## **6. Versioning Discipline**

Each deployment cycle maps:

* **one IER version** → **one or more editions**
* deployment order resets only on version change

Edition 0.1 corresponds exclusively to IER v10.8.2.

---

## **Final Statement**

> Deployment order governs **how the work enters public space**, not **what the work claims**.
> Authority flows from canon to book to paper—never in reverse.
