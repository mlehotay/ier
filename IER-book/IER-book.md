# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8)**

## **Book Context, Structure, and Drafting Constraints**

---

## **Status and Role of This File**

This file defines the **structural, organizational, and drafting constraints** for the *Informational Experiential Realism* book.

It is:

* **non-normative**
* **non-criterial**
* **non-reader-facing**
* **authoritative only with respect to book structure**

It introduces:

* no definitions
* no sufficiency conditions
* no experiential criteria
* no ethical principles
* no necessity claims

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in:

```
IER/IER-specification.md   (v10.8)
```

If any statement in this file conflicts with the Specification,
**the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

---

## **Intended Audience**

This document is written **for authors, editors, and future maintainers of the book**, not for general readers.

Its purpose is to:

* prevent conceptual drift across chapters
* enforce the global argumentative arc
* stabilize terminology
* constrain extensions
* ensure that independently written materials compose into a single coherent book

**`IER/README.md`** explains how to *read* IER.
**`IER-book/IER-book.md`** explains how the *book must be assembled*.

---

## **What This Book Is**

This book presents **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** as a **closed physicalist identity framework**.

Its task is not to persuade by accumulation, synthesis, or intuition-matching, but to:

> **Defend a single identity claim and follow its consequences wherever they lead, without bridge-building or expansion.**

As a result:

* some intuitions are rejected
* some questions are dissolved rather than answered
* some uncertainty is permanent in principle
* ethical consequences are unavoidable

This book is intentionally **modular**, **auditable**, and **non-narrative** in style.

---

## **Book Architecture**

The book is organized as a **compiled corpus with enforced conceptual order**.

* Core claims appear *once* and are referenced thereafter
* Later parts presuppose earlier ones
* Articles are lightly edited for placement, not rewritten as chapters
* Coherence is enforced through **part-level framing**, not stylistic homogenization

---

# **I. Book Structure**

---

## **Front Matter**

### `IER-book/00-front-matter.md`

* Book preface
* Status statements
* How to read the book
* Explanation of modular structure
* Warning about normative closure and non-diagnosability

---

## **Part I — Foundations: Identity of Experience**

### `IER-book/part-1-foundations.md`

**Goal:** Establish experience as a real, physical, *dynamical identity*.

**Conceptual commitments introduced here are presupposed everywhere else.**

### Core inclusions (compiled, lightly edited):

* `IER-paper/IER-paper.md`
* `IER/IER-theory.md`
* `IER/IER-dynamics.md`
* `IER/IER-math.md`
* `IER/IER-specification.md`

**Key claims fixed in this part:**

* experience is identical to a Unified Experiential Field (UEF)
* intrinsic constraint is identity-defining
* subjecthood is categorical
* informational slack precludes experience
* normative closure is enforced

---

## **Part II — Phenomenology: Demonstration Without Foundation**

### `IER-book/part-2-phenomenology.md`

**Goal:** Demonstrate breadth without grounding the theory in phenomenology.

Phenomenology here functions as **proof of principle**, not evidence.

### Core inclusions:

* `IER/IER-emotions.md`
* `IER/IER-brainfeels.md`
* `IER/IER-aphantasia.md`
* `IER/IER-panic.md`
* `IER/IER-psychosis.md`
* `IER/IER-art.md`

**Constraints:**

* No phenomenological report carries epistemic authority
* No phenomenological diversity licenses ontological extension
* No experiential intensity implies moral authority

---

## **Part III — Time, Continuity, and Lived Life**

### `IER-book/part-3-time.md`

**Goal:** Extend experiential identity across time, change, and interruption.

### Core inclusions:

* `IER/IER-continuity.md`
* `IER/IER-persistence.md`

**Key distinctions enforced:**

* regime interruption ≠ subject death
* learning ≠ subject replacement
* participation modulation ≠ new experiencers

---

## **Part IV — Meaning, Access, and Narrative**

### `IER-book/part-4-meaning.md`

**Goal:** Explain why experience feels meaningful without granting epistemic privilege.

### Core inclusions:

* `IER/IER-access.md`
* `IER/IER-meaning.md`
* `IER/IER-intentionality.md`
* `IER/IER-puzzles.md`

**Key commitments:**

* experiential access ≠ epistemic access
* meaning is organizational, not semantic
* intentionality is derived, not primitive
* classic puzzles dissolve structurally

---

## **Part V — Agency and Ethics**

### `IER-book/part-5-ethics.md`

**Goal:** Derive responsibility and moral standing from experiential identity.

### Core inclusions:

* `IER/IER-agency.md`
* `IER/IER-choice.md`
* `IER/IER-free-will.md`
* `IER/IER-ethics.md`
* `IER/IER-morals.md`

**Key claims enforced:**

* standing is categorical
* responsibility is graded
* harm is organizational
* aggregation is blocked
* uncertainty strengthens obligation

---

## **Part VI — Extensions, Boundaries, and Limits**

### `IER-book/part-6-limits.md`

**Goal:** Extend carefully and enforce boundaries.

### Core inclusions:

* `IER/IER-denials.md`
* `IER/IER-contrast.md`
* `IER/IER-critics.md`
* `IER/IER-diagnostics.md`
* `IER/IER-futures.md`

**Explicit non-claims enforced:**

* no diagnostics
* no graded subjecthood
* no collective minds
* no epistemic authority from experience
* no optimization ethics

---

## **Appendices and Placeholders**

The following files are reserved for future expansion but **carry no authority**:

* `IER-book/placeholder-10.md`
* `IER-book/placeholder-20.md`
* `IER-book/placeholder-21.md`
* `IER-book/placeholder-25.md`

They must not introduce new primitives or necessity claims.

# **II. Argumentative Arc (Non-Negotiable)**

All material must respect the following dependency order:

```
Identity
→ Intrinsic Constraint
→ Unified Experiential Fields
→ Phenomenological Demonstration
→ Temporal Persistence
→ Meaning and Narrative
→ Agency
→ Ethics
→ Limits and Non-Claims
```

Violations of this order are drafting errors.

---

# **III. Terminology Discipline**

Global terminology is fixed by the Specification.

No chapter may:

* redefine UEF
* soften intrinsic constraint
* introduce partial subjecthood
* treat experience as graded
* imply detectability

If a term is ambiguous, defer to:

```
IER/IER-specification.md
```

---

# **IV. Drafting and Editing Rules**

* Articles are **compiled**, not rewritten
* Editing is limited to:

  * headings
  * cross-references
  * removal of redundant disclaimers
* Conceptual changes require Specification review
* If a chapter conflicts with this file, **the chapter must change**

---

## **Design Commitments**

* Modularity is a feature, not a flaw
* Auditability is prioritized over narrative flow
* Precision overrides accessibility
* Ethics follows identity, not intuition
* Formalism constrains interpretation, not ontology

---

## **Closing Statement**

This book does not aim to be intuitive.

It aims to be **coherent, closed, and unavoidable**.

> **Experience is real by identity.
> Reality remains singular.
> Ethics begins wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.**
