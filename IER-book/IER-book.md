# **IER Book Context File**

*Informational Experiential Realism (IER)*

This file is the **authoritative context artifact** for drafting the IER book.
It contains the **final outline, normative core, conceptual vocabulary, and project mapping**.
All chapter drafting must remain consistent with this file.

---

## **I. Book Outline**

---

### **Part I – Foundations: Core Identity of Experience**

**Goal:** Establish experience as a real, physical, *dynamical identity*.

---

### **1. Introduction: The Reality of Experience**

* Motivation: reconciling physical realism with lived experience
* Why experience cannot be dismissed, reduced, or metaphysically inflated
* Failures of:

  * Dualism (extra ontology)
  * Panpsychism (over-attribution)
  * Eliminativism (denial)

---

### **2. Experience as Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)**

* Experience as a **Unified Experiential Field**
* Global integration and self-referential organization
* Why unity is structural, not representational
* Experiential pluralism within one physical world
* One dominant UEF per physical system
* Rejection of aggregation and micro-experience models

---

### **3. Intrinsic Constraint and Dynamical Identity**

* What makes constraint **intrinsic**
* Identity-defining vs contingent organization
* Slack, overload, and viability windows
* UEFs as **dynamical regimes**, not static states
* Formation, persistence, destabilization, and collapse of experience

---

### **4. Formal Structure of Experiential Systems**

> **Mathematics is core, not auxiliary.**

* Why formal structure is required for identity claims
* Informational state spaces and system trajectories
* Constraint manifolds and admissible dynamics
* Attractors, regimes, and stability windows
* Why experience corresponds to **regime membership**, not points
* Formal limits: what mathematics can clarify—and what it cannot define

*(Conceptual, diagrammatic, non-reductive)*

---

### **5. Normative Specification**

* The normative status of IER
* Minimal vs full specification
* Non-negotiable identity conditions
* What follows necessarily from UEF identity
* What would count as a violation of the theory

---

## **Part II – Phenomenology: The Breadth of UEFs**

**Goal:** Demonstrate explanatory power across lived experience.

---

### **6. Emotions and Affect as Constraint Attractors**

* Emotions as stable organizational regimes
* Valence, intensity, urgency as constraint dynamics
* Why emotions feel global and action-guiding

---

### **7. Brainfeels and Endogenous Qualitative Patterns**

* Internally generated sensory-like experience
* Qualitative structure without perception or imagery
* Stabilization and regulation of intrinsic constraint

---

### **8. Special Experiential Architectures**

* Aphantasia: high coherence, low slack
* Panic and vasovagal responses as regime-preserving strategies
* Psychosis as pathological instability under constraint

---

### **9. Art and Aesthetic Experience**

* Beauty as unusually coherent intrinsic constraint
* Art as internal and external attractor
* Creative reorganization of experiential regimes

---

### **10. Phenomenology as Proof of Principle**

* One organizational identity, many experiential forms
* Phenomenology as demonstration—not foundation—of the theory

---

## **Part III – Time, Continuity, and Lived Life**

**Goal:** Extend experiential identity across time, change, and learning.

---

### **11. Continuity of Experience**

* Temporal unity without uninterrupted awareness
* Sleep, anesthesia, dissociation, coma
* Distinguishing regime interruption from identity loss
* Experiential Regime Continuity (ERC)

---

### **12. Persistence, Learning, and Development**

* Learning as reorganization of intrinsic constraint
* Skill, habit, trauma, and recovery
* Deep change without creation of new subjects
* Identity preservation through participation modulation

---

## **Part IV – Meaning, Access, and Narrative**

**Goal:** Explain why experience feels meaningful and authoritative.

---

### **13. Experiential vs Epistemic Access**

* What it is like vs what is true
* Why experiential authority ≠ epistemic privilege
* Error, illusion, revelation, and conviction

---

### **14. Meaning, Narrative, and Identity**

* Narrative recurrence and internal coherence
* Meaning as constraint-stabilizing structure
* Identity as dynamically maintained self-organization

---

### **15. Intentionality as a Derived Feature**

* Aboutness without semantic primitives
* Constraint-stabilized orientation to the world
* Dissolution of traditional intentionality puzzles

---

## **Part V – Agency and Ethics**

**Goal:** Derive responsibility and moral standing from structure.

---

### **16. Agency Under Intrinsic Constraint**

* Agency as resolution of intrinsic informational tension
* Degrees of agency within a single UEF
* Ownership of causation without metaphysical freedom

---

### **17. Free Will Reframed**

* Why libertarian and compatibilist debates dissolve
* Constraint-owned causation under determinism
* Coercion, compulsion, and impairment

---

### **18. Ethics and Moral Responsibility**

* Moral harm as destabilization of intrinsic constraint
* Graded responsibility and moral considerability
* Precaution under epistemic uncertainty

---

### **19. Consequences**

* Implications for medicine, law, AI, and social policy
* Why uncertainty increases—not decreases—moral responsibility

---

## **Part VI – Extensions and Limits**

**Goal:** Extend carefully; enforce boundaries.

---

### **20. External and Collective Constraint**

* Crowd psychology and coordination
* Social norms and external pressure
* Why collectives are not UEFs

---

### **21. Cultural Attractors and Shared Meaning**

* Ritual, language, and collaborative art
* Stable multi-agent patterns without collective experience

---

### **22. What IER Is Not**

* Explicit denials
* Incompatibilities with adjacent theories
* Boundary enforcement

---

### **23. Diagnostics, Opacity, and Precaution**

* Why experience cannot be detected or measured
* Ethical limits on experimentation and engineering

---

### **24. Conclusion: Identity Without Mystery**

* Recap: identity → phenomenology → time → meaning → ethics
* What IER explains
* What remains open

---

## **II. Normative Specification (Authoritative Summary)**

### **Experience**

* Experience **is** a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**

* A UEF is:

  * globally integrated
  * temporally continuous
  * self-referential
  * sustained by **coherent intrinsic constraint**

* Entry into a UEF is **categorical**

* A physical system sustains **at most one dominant UEF**

---

### **Intrinsic Constraint**

* Generated by the system’s own integrated dynamics

* Identity-defining and non-decomposable

* Responsible for:

  * unity
  * qualitative character
  * affect
  * agency

* **Slack vs constraint**:

  * excessive slack → non-experiential
  * bounded constraint → stable UEF

---

### **Meaning & Access**

* **Experiential access**: what it is like to bear constraint
* **Epistemic access**: what is true about the world
* No necessary connection between the two
* Meaning and intentionality arise from **constraint-stabilized patterns**

---

### **Agency & Ethics**

* Agency = capacity to resolve intrinsic informational tension
* Free will = **constraint-owned causation**
* Moral harm = destabilization or collapse of intrinsic constraint
* Responsibility scales with constraint-resolution capacity
* Precaution applies under uncertainty

---

### **Boundary Conditions**

* IER introduces **no new substances, forces, or properties**
* Experience cannot be directly detected or measured
* Collective phenomena exert **external constraint only**

---

## **V. Drafting Instructions (For ChatGPT Projects)**

* Treat this file as **non-negotiable ground truth**
* Do not introduce claims that exceed the specification
* Respect the argumentative arc:
  **identity → phenomenology → time → meaning → ethics**
* Mathematics constrains interpretation; it does not define experience
* Extensions must not redefine experience or intrinsic constraint
* Draft chapters independently, then merge for coherence

---

### **Design Commitments**

* Phenomenology is the **demonstration**
* Meaning is the **conceptual payoff**
* Ethics is the **practical consequence**
* Formal structure is **indispensable but non-reductive**
