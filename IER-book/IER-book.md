# Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8)

## Book Context, Structure, and Compilation Rules

---

## Status and Authority

This file defines the **structural, organizational, and drafting constraints** for the
*Informational Experiential Realism* book.

It is:

- **non-normative**
- **non-criterial**
- **non-reader-facing**
- **authoritative only with respect to book assembly and structure**

It introduces:

- no ontological claims
- no experiential criteria
- no necessity conditions
- no ethical principles
- no interpretive authority

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in:

```

IER/IER-specification.md   (v10.8)

```

If any statement in this file conflicts with the Specification,
**the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

---

## Intended Audience

This document is written **for authors, editors, and maintainers**, not for readers.

Its purpose is to:

- enforce dependency order
- prevent conceptual drift
- stabilize terminology
- constrain extensions
- ensure independently written materials compose into a single coherent book

`IER/README.md` explains how to **approach** IER.  
This file explains how the **book must be assembled**.

---

## What This Book Is

The IER book is a **compiled corpus**, not a narrative project.

Its task is not to persuade through accumulation, intuition-matching, or synthesis.
Its task is to:

> **Fix a single physicalist identity claim and follow its consequences wherever they lead, without expansion, reconciliation, or rhetorical softening.**

Accordingly:

- core claims appear **once** and are referenced thereafter
- later material presupposes earlier material
- chapters are compiled, not rewritten
- coherence is enforced at the **part level**, not the prose level
- auditability is prioritized over narrative flow

This book is intentionally:

- modular
- asymmetric
- uncompromising
- closed under v10.8

---

## Compilation Principles (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Compiled, Not Rewritten**  
   Included documents are lightly edited for placement only.

2. **No Authority Duplication**  
   Definitions, criteria, and necessity claims must not be restated outside their source.

3. **One-Way Dependence**  
   Later parts may reference earlier parts.  
   Earlier parts must never reference later parts.

4. **Deletion Over Revision**  
   Redundant framing, motivation, or rhetorical glue must be removed—not rephrased.

5. **Part-Level Framing Carries the Argument**  
   Chapters supply articulation and demonstration, not justification.

# I. Book Structure

---

## Front Matter

### `IER-book/00-front-matter.md`

Includes:

- book preface
- status statements
- how to read a compiled corpus
- warning about normative closure
- warning about non-diagnosability
- explanation of modular structure

No theory appears here.

---

## Part I — Foundations: Identity and Constraint

### `IER-book/part-1-foundations.md`

**Role:** Fix the identity claim once and for all.

This part establishes **everything later material presupposes**.
Nothing here is motivated by phenomenology, ethics, or intuition.

### Compiled inclusions:

- `IER-paper/IER-paper.md`
- `IER/IER-specification.md`
- `IER/IER-theory.md`
- `IER/IER-dynamics.md`
- `IER/IER-math.md`
- `IER/IER-slack.md`

### Claims fixed here (and nowhere else):

- experience is identical to a Unified Experiential Field (UEF)
- intrinsic constraint is identity-defining
- subjecthood is categorical
- informational slack precludes experience
- exactly one dominant UEF per system
- normative closure is enforced

Later parts **must not** re-argue or motivate these claims.

---

## Part II — Phenomenology: Demonstration Without Authority

### `IER-book/part-2-phenomenology.md`

**Role:** Demonstrate breadth without grounding the theory in phenomenology.

Phenomenology here functions as **illustration only**.

### Compiled inclusions:

- `IER/IER-emotions.md`
- `IER/IER-brainfeels.md`
- `IER/IER-aphantasia.md`
- `IER/IER-panic.md`
- `IER/IER-psychosis.md`
- `IER/IER-art.md`

### Constraints:

- no phenomenological report carries epistemic authority
- no experiential diversity licenses ontological extension
- no experiential intensity implies moral authority
- all examples are optional and skippable

Nothing in this part supports or weakens the identity claim.

---

## Part III — Time, Continuity, and Persistence

### `IER-book/part-3-time.md`

**Role:** Extend experiential identity across time without multiplying subjects.

### Compiled inclusions:

- `IER/IER-continuity.md`
- `IER/IER-persistence.md`

### Distinctions enforced:

- regime interruption ≠ subject death
- learning ≠ subject replacement
- participation modulation ≠ new experiencers

No metaphysics is added here.

---

## Part IV — Meaning, Access, and Narrative

### `IER-book/part-4-meaning.md`

**Role:** Explain why experience feels meaningful without granting epistemic privilege.

### Compiled inclusions:

- `IER/IER-access.md`
- `IER/IER-meaning.md`
- `IER/IER-intentionality.md`
- `IER/IER-puzzles.md`

### Commitments enforced:

- experiential access ≠ epistemic access
- meaning is organizational, not semantic
- intentionality is derived, not primitive
- classic puzzles dissolve structurally

This part explains *felt authority* while denying *epistemic authority*.

---

## Part V — Agency and Ethics

### `IER-book/part-5-ethics.md`

**Role:** Derive responsibility and moral standing from experiential identity.

### Compiled inclusions:

- `IER/IER-agency.md`
- `IER/IER-choice.md`
- `IER/IER-free-will.md`
- `IER/IER-ethics.md`
- `IER/IER-morals.md`

### Claims enforced:

- standing is categorical
- responsibility is graded
- harm is organizational
- aggregation is blocked
- uncertainty strengthens obligation

Ethics here is **derived**, not justified.

---

## Part VI — Boundaries, Denials, and Limits

### `IER-book/part-6-limits.md`

**Role:** Close the framework and prevent illegitimate extension.

### Compiled inclusions:

- `IER/IER-denials.md`
- `IER/IER-contrast.md`
- `IER/IER-critics.md`
- `IER/IER-diagnostics.md`
- `IER/IER-futures.md`

### Explicit non-claims enforced:

- no diagnostics
- no graded subjecthood
- no collective minds
- no epistemic authority from experience
- no optimization ethics

Nothing beyond this part is open without reopening the Specification.

---

## Appendices and Placeholders

The following files are reserved for future work and **carry no authority**:

- `IER-book/placeholder-10.md`
- `IER-book/placeholder-20.md`
- `IER-book/placeholder-21.md`
- `IER-book/placeholder-25.md`

They must not introduce new primitives, criteria, or necessity claims.

---

# II. Dependency Order (Strict)

All material must respect the following order:

```

Identity
→ Intrinsic Constraint
→ Unified Experiential Fields
→ Phenomenological Demonstration
→ Temporal Persistence
→ Meaning and Narrative
→ Agency
→ Ethics
→ Limits and Non-Claims

```

Violations of this order are **drafting errors**.

---

# III. Terminology Discipline

Terminology is fixed **exclusively** by the Specification.

No chapter may:

- redefine UEF
- soften intrinsic constraint
- imply partial subjecthood
- treat experience as graded
- suggest detectability or diagnostics

Ambiguity must be resolved by deferring to:

```

IER/IER-specification.md

```

---

# IV. Editing Rules

Permitted edits:

- headings
- cross-references
- removal of redundant disclaimers
- removal of rhetorical motivation

Forbidden edits:

- conceptual rewrites
- clarification of necessity claims
- stylistic harmonization
- reader persuasion

If a chapter conflicts with this file, **the chapter must change**.

---

## Design Commitments

- Modularity over narrative flow
- Auditability over accessibility
- Precision over intuition
- Identity before ethics
- Closure over expansion

---

## Closing Statement

This book is not intended to be intuitive.

It is intended to be **coherent, closed, and unavoidable**.

> Experience is real by identity.  
> Reality remains singular.  
> Ethics begins wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.
