**Version:** v10.8.2  
**Form:** Single-Volume Book

## **Preface — An Orientation to Informational Experiential Realism**
*(`IER-paper/IER-paper.md`)*

This preface presents the IER identity claim as stated in `IER-paper.md`.

All authoritative commitments are fixed exclusively in **Part I**.

---

## **Status, Scope, and Authority**

This book presents **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.2)** as a unified framework.

Exactly one document is normatively authoritative:

> **`IER-specification.md`**

All other chapters are explanatory, elaborative, or orientational and introduce no independent authority.

This book is exhaustive with respect to all **reader-facing corpus documents** enumerated in **Parts I–III** of `IER-manifest.md` (v10.8.2).
