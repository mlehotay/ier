# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.1)**

## **Book Structure, Ordering, and Compilation**

---

## **Status and Authority**

This document defines the **structure, ordering, and compilation rules** for the
single-volume book ***Informational Experiential Realism***.

It is:

* **non-normative**
* **non-criterial**
* **non-reader-facing**
* **authoritative only with respect to ordering and assembly**

It introduces:

* no ontological claims
* no experiential criteria
* no necessity conditions
* no ethical principles
* no interpretive authority

All ontological, criterial, epistemic, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md   (v10.8.1)
```

If any statement in this file conflicts with the Specification,
**the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

---

## **Purpose of This File**

This document exists to:

* preserve the **minimal, closed nature** of the IER identity claim
* ensure the corpus can be printed as **one coherent book**
* enforce **tier discipline** and prevent authority creep
* guarantee **one-way conceptual dependence**
* make explicit which material is **foundational** and which is **derivative**

This file governs **how the book is assembled**, not **what IER claims**.

---

## **Two-Part Book Structure (Binding)**

The book is divided into **two conceptual parts**.

---

### **PART I — The IER Theory Proper (Closed Argument)**

**Question answered**

> *What does IER claim, and what necessarily follows if it is true?*

Characteristics:

* contains **all Tier-1 material**
* includes **Tier-2 exclusionary material required to close misreadings**
* includes **Tier-3 misuse-blocking constraints**
* is **normatively sufficient**
* is **closed under v10.8**
* introduces the identity claim **once and only once**
* contains **no pedagogy, reassurance, or orientation material**

Part I constitutes **the theory itself**.

---

### **PART II — Additional Topics, Applications, and Boundaries**

**Question answered**

> *Given that IER is true, how does it behave across phenomena, applications, and limits?*

Characteristics:

* **presupposes Part I in its entirety**
* introduces **no new foundations**
* elaborates, applies, stress-tests, and contextualizes the theory
* explicitly labels **tier status**
* does **not** reopen or modify the closed argument

---

## **Tier Markers (Global)**

All chapters are labeled with tier markers:

* **[T1] Foundational Canon**
* **[T2] Canon-Constrained Analysis**
* **[T3] Misuse-Blocking / Diagnostic Limits**
* **[T4] Explanatory / Meta**

Tier markers constrain interpretation and authority.

# **PART I — THE IER THEORY PROPER (CLOSED ARGUMENT)**

This part fixes **what experience is**, **when it exists**, and **what necessarily follows**.
No phenomenology, application, or reader alignment appears here.

---

### **1 — Experiential Identity**

---

### **2 — Why Experience Must Be a Regime**

**[T1]** `IER-theory.md`
*Explanatory backbone showing why experience cannot be an aggregate, output, or representation.*

---

### **3 — Dynamics of Unified Experiential Fields**

**[T1]** `IER-dynamics.md`
*How UEFs behave once they exist: dominance, participation modulation, stability, and collapse.*

### **4 — Formal Structure and Coherence**

**[T1]** `IER-math.md`
*Formal support using state spaces, regimes, and coherence without introducing diagnostics.*

---

### **5 — Informational Slack and Structural Exclusion**

**[T2]** `IER-slack.md`
*Structural impossibility argument showing why informational slack is incompatible with experiential identity.*

### **6 — Ethical Consequences of Experiential Identity**

---

### **7 — Why Diagnostics Are Impossible**

**[T3]** `IER-diagnostics.md`

---

> **End of Part I**
> At this point, the IER theory is fully specified, normatively closed, and structurally protected.
