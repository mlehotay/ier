# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.1)**

## **Book Context, Structure, and Compilation Rules**

---

## **Status and Authority**

This file defines the **structural, organizational, and compilation constraints** for the
printed book **Informational Experiential Realism**.

It is:

* **non-normative**
* **non-criterial**
* **non-reader-facing**
* **authoritative only with respect to book assembly, ordering, and maintenance**

It introduces:

* no ontological claims
* no experiential criteria
* no necessity conditions
* no ethical principles
* no interpretive authority

All ontological, criterial, epistemic, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in:

```
IER/IER-specification.md   (v10.8)
```

If any statement in this file conflicts with the Specification,
**the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

---

## **Purpose of This File**

This document exists to:

* preserve the **minimal, closed nature** of the IER identity claim
* allow the **entire canonical corpus** to be printed **in a single bound volume**
* enforce **tier discipline** and prevent authority inflation
* guarantee **one-way dependency**
* ensure that no document appears to do argumentative work it does not do

This file governs **how the book is assembled**, not **what IER claims**.

---

## **Single-Book, Two-Division Structure (Binding)**

**Informational Experiential Realism** is published as **one physical book** with
**two internal divisions**, each with a distinct structural role.

These divisions are **conceptual and organizational**, not separate publications.

---

### **Division A — The Closed Argument**

**Question answered**

> *What does IER claim, and what necessarily follows if it is true?*

**Characteristics**

Division A:

* contains **all Tier-1 material**
* includes only Tier-2 material required to **demonstrate consequences**
* is **normatively sufficient**
* is **closed under v10.8**
* contains **no pedagogy, reassurance, or reader-alignment material**
* fixes the identity claim and its entailments **once and only once**

Division A constitutes **the theory proper**.

---

### **Division B — The Complete Corpus**

**Question answered**

> *Given that IER is true, how does it behave across phenomena, confusions, boundaries, and readers?*

**Characteristics**

Division B:

* **presupposes Division A in its entirety**
* contains **no foundational restatement**
* prints **all remaining canonical documents**
* uses the same six-Part dependency spine **as anchors**
* explicitly labels **tier status**
* includes misuse-blocking and reader-alignment material **without inflating authority**

Division B does **not** add to the theory.
It elaborates, constrains, tests, and contextualizes it.

---

## **Tier Discipline (Global, Binding)**

All chapters are labeled with explicit tier markers:

* **[T1] Foundational Canon**
* **[T2] Canon-Constrained Analysis**
* **[T3] Misuse-Blocking / Diagnostic Limits**
* **[T4] Explanatory / Pedagogical / Meta**

Tier markers:

* constrain interpretation
* prohibit authority creep
* are mandatory throughout the book
* are never optional or decorative

---

## **Compilation Principles (Non-Negotiable)**

1. **Compiled, Not Rewritten**
   Documents are included verbatim except for heading normalization, trimming redundancy, and removal of duplicated disclaimers.

2. **No Authority Duplication**
   Definitions, criteria, and necessity claims appear **once**, in their source documents.

3. **One-Way Dependence**
   Later Parts may reference earlier Parts.
   Earlier Parts must never reference later Parts.

4. **Deletion Over Revision**
   Redundant motivation or reassurance must be removed, not rephrased.

5. **No Argument Inflation**
   Inclusion in Division B does **not** imply argumentative necessity.

6. **Explicit Presupposition**
   Division B must state clearly that it presupposes Division A.
