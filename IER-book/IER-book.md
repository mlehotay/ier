## **Preface — An Orientation to Informational Experiential Realism**
**[IER-paper.md]**

*This preface provides motivation, historical context, and conceptual orientation.
It introduces no new claims and carries no independent normative authority.
All authoritative commitments are fixed exclusively in Part I.*

---

# **PART I — THE IER THEORY PROPER**

*The identity of experience and its necessary consequences.*

> **End of Part I**  
> At this point, the IER theory is fully specified, normatively closed, and structurally protected.

# **PART II — APPLICATIONS, ELABORATIONS, AND BOUNDARIES**

*All material below presupposes Part I in full.*

## **Phenomenology and Experiential Organization**

These chapters demonstrate how diverse qualitative and affective structures arise from different organizations of intrinsic constraint within an already-existing Unified Experiential Field. They introduce no new criteria for experience and do not modify experiential identity.
