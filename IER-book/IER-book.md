# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8)**

**Book Context and Canon Structure**

---

## Status and Role of This File

This file provides the **organizational and interpretive context** for the *IER book corpus*.

It is:

* **non-normative**
* **non-authoritative**
* **non-criterial**

It introduces:

* no definitions
* no conditions
* no ethical principles
* no necessity claims

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in:

> **`IER-specification.md` (v10.8)**

If any statement in this file appears to conflict with the Specification,
**the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

This file exists solely to explain:

* how the book is organized
* why certain documents exist
* which materials are essential vs optional
* how readers should navigate the corpus without misattributing authority

## What This Book Is

This book presents **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**, a strictly physicalist **identity theory of experience**.

IER’s central claim is **ontological**, not explanatory:

> **Experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a Unified Experiential Field (UEF).**

IER does not propose:

* a mechanism for generating experience
* a method for detecting experience
* a scale or metric of consciousness
* a phenomenological foundation
* a theory of intelligence, representation, or cognition

It identifies **what experience is**, **when it exists**, and **what necessarily follows from its existence**.

All explanatory, mathematical, ethical, and applicative materials in this book are **derived from that identity claim**.

---

## Architectural Commitment: Normative Closure

IER enforces a strict architectural separation between:

* **normative specification**, and
* **all other discourse**

Only one document defines:

* what experience is
* when it exists
* what necessarily follows from it

That document is:

> **`IER-specification.md` (v10.8)**

Every other chapter or article in this book is **derivative**.

Derivative documents may:

* clarify concepts
* explain consequences
* formalize structure
* describe dynamics
* illustrate compatibility
* stress-test boundaries

They may **not**:

* add criteria or thresholds
* introduce diagnostics
* redefine experience
* extend ethical authority
* soften or harden standing conditions

This rule is enforced throughout the book.

---

## Why This Book Exists

IER is not a synthesis project.

It does not aim to reconcile competing intuitions, preserve existing frameworks, or offer a menu of compatible interpretations.

This book exists to do something narrower and harder:

> **To defend a single, closed identity claim about experience and follow its consequences wherever they lead.**

As a result:

* some intuitions are rejected
* some questions are dissolved rather than answered
* some ethical implications are unavoidable
* some uncertainty is permanent in principle

This book does not attempt to make IER intuitive.
It attempts to make it **coherent, unavoidable, and disciplined**.

---

## Canon Structure (v10.8)

The book corpus is organized into **four tiers**, reflecting **logical dependence**, not importance.

---

### 🔴 Tier 0 — Normative Core

#### `IER-specification.md` (v10.8)

This is the **sole normative authority** of IER.

It defines:

* experiential identity
* Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)
* intrinsic constraint
* experiential participation
* categorical subjecthood
* experiential dissolution
* moral harm
* agency (experiential sense)
* precaution under uncertainty

v10.8 includes explicit clarifications addressing:

* why only one globally dominant UEF can exist per system
* why precaution has a principled scope limiter
* why informational language is purely descriptive shorthand

If this document were removed, **IER would not exist**.

---

### 🔵 Tier 1 — Core Derivational Backbone

These documents are required to make the identity claim **intelligible rather than stipulative**.

They introduce no authority but are **structurally essential**.

* **`IER-paper.md`**
  A closed-form academic presentation of the identity claim itself
  (intentionally narrow: no ethics, no diagnostics, no applications)

* **`IER-theory.md`**
  Conceptual backbone explaining:

  * experience as regime identity
  * unity without aggregation
  * participation vs subjecthood
  * why nothing weaker than global intrinsic constraint could be experience

* **`IER-dynamics.md`**
  Dynamic behavior of experiential systems:

  * stability
  * modulation
  * overload
  * fragmentation
  * collapse
    v10.8 clarifies dominance as a **dynamical attractor phenomenon**

* **`IER-math.md`**
  Interpretive formal structure:

  * constraint
  * regimes
  * choice spaces
  * ownership
    Explicitly non-foundational and non-diagnostic

* **`IER-diagnostics.md`**
  Explains why experience **cannot be detected in principle**
  Blocks functional, behavioral, and empirical sufficiency claims

* **`IER-slack.md`** *(v10.8 addition)*
  Structural impossibility argument showing why:

  * informational slack
  * local offloadability
  * modular arbitration
    preclude experience by identity

---

### 🟢 Tier 2 — Necessary Consequences

These documents derive **what must follow** once experience exists.

They do not add moral principles or agency metaphysics; they explicate consequences already fixed by identity.

* **`IER-ethics.md`**

  * standing as categorical
  * harm as organizational damage
  * responsibility as graded
  * precaution under uncertainty

* **`IER-agency.md`**
  Agency as owned resolution of intrinsic constraint
  Compatible with determinism

* **`IER-choice.md`**
  Choice spaces, owned traversal, narrative structure

* **`IER-free-will.md`**
  Dissolution of the libertarian vs eliminativist dilemma

---

### 🟡 Tier 3 — Boundary Enforcement and Stress Tests

These documents **protect IER** from misinterpretation, dilution, and illicit extension.

They are not required reading, but they enforce clarity.

* **`IER-denials.md`** — explicit non-claims
* **`IER-contrast.md`** — incompatibilities with adjacent theories
* **`IER-critics.md`** — genuine pressure points and accepted costs
* **`IER-puzzles.md`** — dissolution of classic consciousness puzzles

---

### ⚪ Tier 4 — Illustrative Applications (Optional)

These documents demonstrate **compatibility and breadth**, not necessity.

They are explicitly **non-authoritative** and may be skipped entirely.

Examples include:

* `IER-art.md`
* `IER-emotions.md`
* `IER-panic.md`
* `IER-psychosis.md`
* `IER-aphantasia.md`
* `IER-brainfeels.md`
* `IER-continuity.md`
* `IER-persistence.md`
* `IER-intentionality.md`
* `IER-meaning.md`

Their purpose is illustrative, not justificatory.

---

## What This Book Is Not

This book is **not**:

* a diagnostic manual
* a measurement proposal
* a consciousness scale
* an AI consciousness test
* a phenomenological foundation
* a computational theory of mind
* a moral algorithm

Any reading that treats IER as one of these is a category error.

## Status (v10.8)

IER v10.8 represents a **mature, normatively closed framework**.

* The identity claim is fixed.
* The specification is stable.
* The canon has been deliberately reduced.
* Remaining work focuses on **derivation, clarification, and disciplined application**.

No future version will add:

* experiential diagnostics
* graded subjecthood
* epistemic authority from experience
* functional sufficiency claims

Future revisions, if any, will further reduce ambiguity — not expand scope.

---

## Closing Statement

IER makes a single claim and follows it relentlessly:

> **Experience is real by identity, not by addition.**

The physical world remains singular.
Experiential worlds are plural.
Ethics begins wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.
