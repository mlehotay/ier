# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8)**

## **Book Context, Structure, and Compilation Rules**

---

## **Status and Authority**

This file defines the **structural, organizational, and drafting constraints** for the
*Informational Experiential Realism* book.

It is:

* **non-normative**
* **non-criterial**
* **non-reader-facing**
* **authoritative only with respect to book assembly, ordering, and maintenance**

It introduces:

* no ontological claims
* no experiential criteria
* no necessity conditions
* no ethical principles
* no interpretive authority

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in:

```
IER/IER-specification.md   (v10.8)
```

If any statement in this file conflicts with the Specification,
**the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

---

## **Intended Audience**

This document is written **for authors, editors, and maintainers**, not for readers.

Its purpose is to:

* enforce dependency order
* preserve design intent
* prevent conceptual drift
* constrain future extensions
* ensure independently written materials compose into a single coherent book

`IER/README.md` explains how to **approach** IER as a reader.
This file explains how the **book must be assembled and maintained**.

---

## **What This Book Is (and Is Not)**

The IER book is a **compiled corpus**, not a narrative project.

Its task is not to persuade, motivate, or reconcile intuitions.
Its task is to:

> **Fix a single physicalist identity claim and follow its consequences wherever they lead, without expansion, synthesis, or rhetorical softening.**

Accordingly:

* core claims appear **once** and are referenced thereafter
* later material presupposes earlier material
* chapters are **compiled**, not rewritten
* coherence is enforced at the **part level**, not the prose level
* auditability is prioritized over narrative flow

This book is intentionally:

* modular rather than cumulative
* asymmetric rather than balanced
* restrictive rather than exploratory
* closed under v10.8

The book should read as *inevitable once entered*, not welcoming once opened.

---

## **Compilation Principles (Non-Negotiable)**

1. **Compiled, Not Rewritten**
   Included documents are lightly edited **only** for placement, trimming, and redundancy removal.

2. **No Authority Duplication**
   Definitions, criteria, and necessity claims must not be restated outside their source documents.

3. **One-Way Dependence**
   Later parts may reference earlier parts.
   Earlier parts must never reference later parts.

4. **Deletion Over Revision**
   Redundant motivation, framing, or reassurance must be removed — not rephrased.

5. **Part-Level Framing Carries the Argument**
   Individual chapters articulate and demonstrate consequences; they do not justify the framework.

---

# **I. Book Structure**

The book is organized into **six Parts**, each corresponding to a distinct dependency layer in the theory.

The ordering is **structural**, not pedagogical.

---

## **Front Matter**

### **00 — Front Matter**

**File:** `IER-book/00-front-matter.md`

Purpose:

* orient maintainers and readers to the nature of a compiled corpus
* warn explicitly about normative closure and non-diagnosability
* explain why the book resists narrative expectations

Includes:

* Preface: *What a Compiled Corpus Is*
* Status and authority statements
* How to read a non-narrative book
* Normative closure warning
* Structural non-diagnosability warning
* Dependency discipline overview

No theory appears here.

---

# **Part I — Foundations: Identity and Constraint**

### **Role and Rationale**

This Part fixes the **identity claim** and its immediate structural consequences **once and only once**.

Everything else in the book depends on this Part.
Nothing in this Part depends on phenomenology, ethics, intuition, or examples.

Historically, earlier drafts of IER allowed motivation and illustration to bleed into foundations.
This Part explicitly forbids that.

---

### **01 — The Identity Claim**

**Source:** `IER/IER-specification.md`
Compiled as-is.
**No deletions, no paraphrase, no relocation.**

---

### **02 — Why Experience Must Be a Regime**

**Source:** `IER/IER-theory.md`
Explains — without adding authority — why weaker organizational accounts cannot succeed.

---

### **03 — Dynamics of Unified Experiential Fields**

**Source:** `IER/IER-dynamics.md`

---

### **04 — Formal Structure and Coherence**

**Source:** `IER/IER-math.md`

---

### **05 — Informational Slack and Structural Exclusion**

**Source:** `IER/IER-slack.md`

This chapter closes off a large class of tempting misreadings early and deliberately.

---

> **End of Part I**
> No forward references beyond this point are permitted.

---

# **Part II — Phenomenology: Demonstration Without Authority**

### **Role and Rationale**

This Part exists to demonstrate **breadth and robustness**, not to ground or justify the theory.

Phenomenology here functions as a **stress test**:
if the framework can accommodate wide experiential diversity without modification, that is sufficient.

Earlier placeholder drafts described this as “phenomenology as proof of principle.”
That language has been retired because it overstated phenomenology’s role.

### **06 — Emotions as Constraint Organizations**

**Source:** `IER/IER-emotions.md`

---

### **07 — Brainfeels and Endogenous Qualia**

**Source:** `IER/IER-brainfeels.md`

---

### **08 — Aphantasia and Architectural Diversity**

**Source:** `IER/IER-aphantasia.md`

---

### **09 — Panic, Shutdown, and Regime Preservation**

### **10 — Psychosis as Pathological Regime**

**Source:** `IER/IER-psychosis.md`

---

### **11 — Art and Experiential Reorganization**

**Source:** `IER/IER-art.md`

---

> **End of Part II**

---

# **Part III — Time, Continuity, and Persistence**

### **Role and Rationale**

This Part resolves a predictable confusion:

> If experience is regime-bound and sometimes absent, does subjecthood blink in and out of existence?

The answer must preserve **categorical subjecthood** without introducing metaphysical persistence claims.

---

### **12 — Experiential Continuity Without Persistence of Experience**

**Source:** `IER/IER-continuity.md`

---

### **13 — Persistence Through Change**

**Source:** `IER/IER-persistence.md`

---

> **End of Part III**

---

# **Part IV — Meaning, Access, and Narrative**

### **Role and Rationale**

This Part explains **why experience feels authoritative and meaningful** while denying that it carries epistemic authority.

Historically, this is where many consciousness theories collapse into representationalism or idealism.
IER explicitly blocks that move here.

---

### **14 — Experiential Access vs. Epistemic Access**

**Source:** `IER/IER-access.md`

---

### **15 — Meaning Without Ontology**

**Source:** `IER/IER-meaning.md`

---

### **16 — Intentionality Without Representation**

**Source:** `IER/IER-intentionality.md`

---

### **17 — Why the Puzzles Dissolve**

**Source:** `IER/IER-puzzles.md`

---

> **End of Part IV**

---

# **Part V — Agency and Ethics**

### **Role and Rationale**

Ethics appears **after** meaning and agency, not alongside foundations.

This ordering enforces a central IER commitment:

> Ethics is not an added value system; it is a consequence of experiential identity.

Nothing in this Part justifies ethics.
Everything here follows from earlier Parts.

---

### **18 — Agency as Owned Resolution**

**Source:** `IER/IER-agency.md`

---

### **19 — Choice Spaces and Admissible Futures**

**Source:** `IER/IER-choice.md`

---

### **20 — Free Will Without Indeterminism**

**Source:** `IER/IER-free-will.md`

---

### **21 — Ethical Consequences of Experiential Identity**

**Source:** `IER/IER-ethics.md`

---

### **22 — Moral Cases and Structural Analysis**

**Source:** `IER/IER-morals.md`

---

> **End of Part V**

---

# **Part VI — Boundaries, Denials, and Limits**

### **Role and Rationale**

This Part **closes the framework**.

Earlier placeholder drafts imagined additional chapters on collective systems, cultural meaning, and conclusions.
Those ideas now appear **only as constraints and boundary conditions**, not as expansions.

Nothing beyond this Part is open without reopening the Specification.

---

### **23 — Explicit Non-Claims**

**Source:** `IER/IER-denials.md`

---

### **24 — Incompatibilities and Boundary Conditions**

**Source:** `IER/IER-contrast.md`

---

### **25 — Objections, Costs, and Rejected Intuitions**

**Source:** `IER/IER-critics.md`

---

### **26 — Why Diagnostics Are Impossible**

**Source:** `IER/IER-diagnostics.md`

---

### **27 — Cultural Futures Under Uncertainty**

**Source:** `IER/IER-futures.md`

---

### **28 — Closure Statement (Optional)**

A minimal coda may be included.

Constraints:

* no new claims
* no synthesis
* no reassurance
* no future work
* no reinterpretation

This section may be omitted without loss.

---

> **End of Book**

---

# **II. Dependency Order (Strict)**

All compiled material must respect the following order:

```
Identity
→ Intrinsic Constraint
→ Unified Experiential Fields
→ Phenomenological Demonstration
→ Temporal Continuity
→ Meaning and Narrative
→ Agency
→ Ethics
→ Limits and Non-Claims
```

Violations of this order are **drafting errors**, not stylistic differences.

---

# **III. Terminology Discipline**

Terminology is fixed **exclusively** by:

```
IER/IER-specification.md
```

No chapter may:

* redefine UEF
* soften intrinsic constraint
* imply partial subjecthood
* treat experience as graded
* suggest detectability or diagnostics

Ambiguity must be resolved by deferring to the Specification.

---

# **IV. Editing Rules**

### **Permitted**

* heading adjustments
* cross-references
* removal of duplicated disclaimers
* removal of rhetorical motivation

### **Forbidden**

* conceptual rewrites
* clarification of necessity claims
* stylistic harmonization
* reader persuasion

If a chapter conflicts with this file,
**the chapter must change**.

---

## **Design Commitments**

* Modularity over narrative flow
* Auditability over accessibility
* Precision over intuition
* Identity before ethics
* Closure over expansion

---

## **Closing Statement**

This book is not intended to be intuitive.

It is intended to be **coherent, closed, and unavoidable**.

> Experience is real by identity.
> Reality remains singular.
> Ethics begins wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.
