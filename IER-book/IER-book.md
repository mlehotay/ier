# Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.6)

**A Physicalist Identity Theory of Experience, Meaning, Agency, and Moral Standing**

---

## Preface: What This Book Is

This book presents **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**: a strictly physicalist framework that identifies conscious experience with a specific organizational and dynamical regime of physical systems.

IER is not:

- a theory of knowledge
- a theory of truth
- a theory of representation
- a diagnostic framework
- a phenomenological method
- a proposal for measuring consciousness

It is a theory of **what experience is**, **when it exists**, and **what necessarily follows from its existence**.

All normative commitments are fixed by a single document:

> **`IER-specification.md` (IER v10.6)**

Everything else in this book is **explanatory, interpretive, or applicative**, and introduces no independent authority.

---

## Architectural Commitments

IER enforces the following structural constraints throughout this book:

1. **Normative closure**  
   Only the Specification defines experience, subjecthood, and ethical consequence.

2. **Identity, not emergence**  
   Experience is identical to a physical regime; it is not caused by, realized by, or emergent from something else.

3. **Categorical subjecthood**  
   Experience exists or does not exist. There are no partial subjects or degrees of experiencerhood.

4. **Experiential ≠ epistemic authority**  
   Meaning, urgency, coherence, and intensity do not imply truth or correctness.

5. **Precaution under uncertainty**  
   Ethical obligation increases where experiential status is uncertain, not where it is proven.

Any claim that violates these constraints is out of scope for IER.
