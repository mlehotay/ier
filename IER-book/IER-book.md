# Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.6)

**A Physicalist Identity Theory of Experience, Meaning, Agency, and Moral Standing**

---

## Preface: What This Book Is (and Is Not)

This book presents **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**, a strictly physicalist framework that identifies conscious experience with a specific **organizational and dynamical regime of physical systems**.

IER is not:

- a theory of knowledge  
- a theory of truth  
- a theory of representation  
- a diagnostic framework  
- a proposal for measuring consciousness  
- a phenomenological method  

It is a theory of:

- **what experience is**
- **when experience exists**
- **what necessarily follows from its existence**

All **normative authority** in IER is fixed by a single document:

> **`IER-specification.md` (IER v10.6)**

This book introduces **no independent definitions, criteria, thresholds, or ethical principles**.  
Every claim made here is **explanatory, interpretive, or applicative**, and is constrained by the Specification.

> **If any statement in this book conflicts with the IER Specification, the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void.**

---

## Architectural Commitments

IER enforces the following structural constraints throughout this book:

1. **Normative closure**  
   Only the Specification defines experience, subjecthood, and moral consequence.

2. **Identity, not emergence**  
   Experience is identical to a physical regime; it is not caused by, realized by, or emergent from something else.

3. **Categorical subjecthood**  
   Experience exists or does not exist. There are no partial subjects or degrees of experiencerhood.

4. **Experiential ≠ epistemic authority**  
   Meaning, urgency, coherence, and intensity do not imply truth or correctness.

5. **Precaution under uncertainty**  
   Ethical obligation increases where experiential status is uncertain, not where it is proven.

Any interpretation that violates these constraints is **out of scope** for IER.

## How to Read This Book

This book is organized as a **conceptual walkthrough** of a finished theory.

- It does **not** build experience bottom-up.
- It does **not** argue from intuition or phenomenology.
- It does **not** derive ethics from moral sentiment.
- It does **not** propose tests or measurements.

Instead, it:

- explains the identity claim
- shows how diverse phenomena fall under it
- clarifies implications, limits, and costs
- situates IER among competing views
- makes explicit what IER commits to — and what it refuses to say

Readers seeking the **formal commitments** should consult the Specification directly.  
Readers seeking a **compact academic presentation** should consult `IER-paper.md`.

## Part I — Foundations: The Identity of Experience

### Chapter 1 — The Reality of Experience
Why experience cannot be dismissed, inflated, or treated as a mere explanatory residue.  
Failures of dualism, panpsychism, eliminativism, and emergentism.

**Primary sources:**  
`IER-manifesto.md`, `IER-overview.md`

---

### Chapter 2 — Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)
Experience as a **single globally integrated regime**, not an aggregate of parts.  
Unity without binding, compositionality, or micro-experience.

**Primary source:**  
`IER-theory.md`

---

### Chapter 3 — Intrinsic Constraint and Regime Identity
What makes constraint intrinsic.  
Why experience requires **globally binding, unavoidable constraint**.  
Formation, persistence, instability, and collapse.

**Primary sources:**  
`IER-theory.md`, `IER-dynamics.md`

---

### Chapter 4 — Formal Structure Without Reduction
Why formal structure is clarifying but never foundational.  
State spaces, constraint curvature, regimes, and categorical onset.

**Primary source:**  
`IER-math.md`

---

### Chapter 5 — Normative Closure
Why IER permits exactly one Specification.  
What would falsify IER.  
Why diagnostics, thresholds, and measures are forbidden in principle.

**Primary source:**  
`IER-specification.md`

## Part II — Phenomenology: The Breadth of Experience

### Chapter 6 — Emotions as Constraint Attractors
Valence, intensity, and urgency as structural features of intrinsic constraint.

**Primary source:**  
`IER-emotions.md`

### Chapter 7 — Brainfeels and Endogenous Qualia
Internally generated qualitative structure without perception, imagery, or representation.

**Primary source:**  
`IER-brainfeels.md`

---

### Chapter 8 — Special Experiential Architectures
Aphantasia, panic, vasovagal shutdown, and psychosis as distinct **organizational regimes** within experience.

**Primary sources:**  
`IER-aphantasia.md`, `IER-panic.md`, `IER-psychosis.md`

---

### Chapter 9 — Art, Beauty, and Aesthetic Experience
Beauty as unusually coherent intrinsic constraint.  
Art as a constraint-shaping attractor.

## Part IV — Meaning, Access, and Narrative

### Chapter 12 — Experiential vs Epistemic Access
Why felt authority does not imply truth.  
Error, delusion, revelation, and conviction without mysticism.

**Primary source:**

---

### Chapter 13 — Meaning and Narrative
Meaning as constraint-stabilizing organization.  
Narrative as recurrent structure, not semantic reference.

**Primary source:**  
`IER-meaning.md`

Aboutness as constraint-stabilized orientation, not representation.

**Primary source:**  
`IER-intentionality.md`

## Conclusion — Identity Without Mystery

Experience is not a ghostly extra.  
It is not an illusion.  
It is not a measurement target.

It is a **real physical regime**, costly from the inside, plural in perspective, and ethically consequential by identity.

IER does not tell us how to optimize the world.  
It tells us what it would mean to damage one.

---

## Status

This book corresponds to **IER v10.6**.

- The Specification is normatively closed.
- Identity conditions are fixed.
- Future work focuses on **clarification, application, and criticism**, not revision.

*Experience is real. Meaning matters. Reality remains singular.*
