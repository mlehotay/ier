# **Part VI — Extensions and Limits**
## **Boundaries, Denials, and Precaution**

This final part enforces the **limits** of Informational Experiential Realism.

It addresses:

* explicit non-claims
* incompatibilities with nearby theories
* the impossibility of diagnosing experience
* the ethical consequences of epistemic opacity

IER is deliberately restrictive.
Many tempting inferences are blocked:

* collective or group minds
* experiential aggregation
* scalar consciousness measures
* optimization or engineering targets

These chapters explain **why those moves fail**, and why restraint is not a weakness but a consequence of taking experiential identity seriously.

The book ends not by expanding the theory, but by **closing it cleanly**.
