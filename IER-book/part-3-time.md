# **Part III — Time, Continuity, and Lived Life**

Experience is not static.
Yet experiential subjecthood is not replaced moment by moment.

This part explains how IER accounts for **change across time** without invoking:

* serial subjects
* momentary experiencers
* metaphysical rebirth
* partial or fractional selves

The chapters here address:

* sleep, anesthesia, and experiential gaps
* continuity without uninterrupted awareness
* learning, habit, trauma, and recovery
* deep experiential change within a single subject

The central distinction is between:

* **regime interruption**, and
* **loss of experiential capacity**

By treating experience as a **regime of organization**, IER allows for substantial change while preserving categorical identity.

Time alters experience — not the fact of experience.
