# **Part III — Orientation, Context, and Navigation**

The material in this part provides **orientation, context, and navigational support** for reading Informational Experiential Realism.

These chapters:

* introduce **no ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical commitments**
* do **not** revise or interpret the identity claim
* do **not** license new inferences or applications
* exist solely to aid understanding, placement, and use of the framework

Nothing in this part carries independent theoretical authority.

All authoritative claims remain fixed exclusively in **Part I**, and all applications remain governed by its constraints.
