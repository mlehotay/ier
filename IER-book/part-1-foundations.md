# **Part I — Foundations**
## **The Identity of Experience**

This part establishes the **core identity claim** of Informational Experiential Realism (IER):

> **Experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a Unified Experiential Field (UEF).**

The chapters that follow define what this claim means, what it excludes, and what necessarily follows from it.

Part I does **not** argue from intuition, phenomenology, or empirical correlation.
It fixes the **ontological and normative structure** on which all later chapters depend.

Specifically, this part:

* rejects dualism, eliminativism, panpsychism, and emergent surplus
* identifies experience with a **dynamical regime**, not a substance or property
* introduces **intrinsic constraint** as the organizing principle of experiential unity
* formally distinguishes **normative specification** from explanatory extension

Nothing later in the book revises or competes with the commitments established here.

If the identity claim fails, everything that follows fails with it.
