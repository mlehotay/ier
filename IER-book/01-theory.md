# **Part I — The IER Theory Proper**

This part fixes the **identity of experience** and the **conditions under which it exists**.

Under Informational Experiential Realism (IER), experience is **identical** to the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** operating under **coherent intrinsic constraint**. This identity claim is categorical and exclusive: if a UEF exists, experience exists; if no UEF exists, experience does not.

The chapters in Part I:

* define the identity claim precisely
* establish its necessary structural features
* rule out weaker or competing interpretations
* derive the ethical consequences that follow by necessity
* enforce the impossibility of experiential diagnostics

Part I is **normatively sufficient** and **structurally closed**.
Nothing later in the book revises, extends, softens, or competes with the commitments fixed here.

All subsequent material presupposes Part I in full.
If the identity claim fails, everything that follows fails with it.
