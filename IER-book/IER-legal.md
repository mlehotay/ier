## **0. Status and Non-Scope Declaration**

This document is **not part of the Informational Experiential Realism (IER) canonical corpus** and carries **no ontological, ethical, or theoretical authority**.

It does **not**:

* assert or deny AI consciousness, experience, or moral standing
* argue for or against AI legal personhood
* derive claims from the IER identity thesis
* propose future legal reforms

It **only** describes **prevailing legal treatment** of AI-assisted authorship **as of 2025**, for the purpose of clarifying ownership, authorship, licensing, disclosure, and responsibility.

Nothing in this document precludes future statutory or judicial changes.

## **1. Purpose and Use**

This document exists to:

* clarify copyright ownership in AI-assisted works
* document compliance with current intellectual property norms
* reduce legal and procedural risk in publication contexts
* distinguish **law**, **platform policy**, and **editorial norms**

It is intended for use alongside:

* `IER-book`
* `IER-publishing`
* submission materials for preprints, journals, or commercial publication

## **2. Human Authorship Under Current Law**

### **2.1 Human Authorship Requirement**

Across major jurisdictions—including the United States, European Union, and United Kingdom—copyright law currently presupposes **human authorship**.

Under prevailing doctrine:

* copyright vests only in legal persons recognized as authors
* non-human systems are not currently recognized as copyright authors
* authorship is attributed to humans who exercise creative control

This is a **legal classification**, not a claim about intelligence, autonomy, or experience.

---

### **2.2 AI as an Assistive Tool**

When AI systems are used as tools under human direction, the human user is treated as the author **provided that the human**:

* determines the purpose and structure of the work
* selects prompts or inputs
* evaluates, edits, revises, or rejects generated material
* exercises final editorial judgment

Under these conditions, AI systems are treated analogously to other non-authorial tools such as:

* statistical software
* grammar or translation systems
* search and summarization tools

The presence of AI assistance does **not** negate human authorship.

---

## **3. Ownership of AI-Assisted Outputs**

### **3.1 Platform Terms and Assignment of Rights**

Under the publicly stated terms of service of major conversational AI platforms as of 2025:

* users are granted ownership of generated textual output
* platform providers disclaim authorship
* providers retain no publication or derivative rights over user content

Accordingly:

* copyright in the textual expression vests in the user
* the platform is not a co-author or rights holder

This allocation is contractual and may vary by platform.

---

### **3.2 Ideas, Theories, and Expression**

Copyright law distinguishes between:

* **ideas, facts, and theories** (not copyrightable)
* **expression** of those ideas (copyrightable)

Therefore:

* scientific or philosophical theories enter the public domain once disclosed
* the authored text articulating those theories remains protected

AI assistance does not alter this distinction.

---

## **4. Joint Authorship and Legal Capacity**

### **4.1 Joint Authorship Requirements**

Joint authorship requires:

* legal capacity to be an author
* mutual intent to create a joint work

Under current law:

* AI systems are not recognized as having legal authorship capacity
* generated content alone does not establish joint authorship

This reflects **current legal recognition**, not a claim about future possibilities.

---

### **4.2 No Implied Co-Authorship**

The use of AI assistance does **not** imply:

* shared authorship
* divided ownership
* dilution of moral or economic rights

Absent explicit legal recognition, AI systems are not treated as authors for copyright purposes.

---

## **5. Moral Rights (Jurisdictional Note)**

In jurisdictions recognizing moral rights (e.g., EU member states, UK, Canada):

* moral rights attach to human authors
* they include attribution and integrity interests
* AI assistance does not negate moral rights

Disclosure of AI use does **not** constitute waiver of moral rights unless explicitly contracted.

---

## **6. Originality and Plagiarism**

### **6.1 Originality Standard**

Copyright requires:

* independent creation
* minimal creativity

Novelty relative to all prior works is **not** required.

AI assistance does not undermine originality where the final expression is independently produced and not substantially similar to existing copyrighted works.

---

### **6.2 Author Responsibility**

The human author remains responsible for ensuring that:

* no copyrighted material is reproduced without authorization
* sources are properly cited
* generated text is reviewed for similarity

Routine plagiarism screening is considered best practice.

---

## **7. Disclosure of AI Assistance**

### **7.1 Legal vs. Policy Requirements**

There is **no general legal requirement** to disclose AI assistance in authorship.

However, disclosure may be required or recommended by:

* academic journals
* preprint servers
* funding agencies
* institutional ethics policies

Failure to comply may constitute a **procedural or contractual issue**, not a copyright defect.

---

### **7.2 Recommended Disclosure Practice**

A minimal, widely accepted disclosure is sufficient, for example:

> *“AI-assisted language tools were used during drafting and editing under the author’s supervision. All substantive content and conclusions are the author’s own.”*

Such disclosure:

* preserves transparency
* does not imply AI authorship
* does not transfer rights

---

## **8. Preprint and Publication Considerations**

### **8.1 Preprint Licensing**

Preprint servers typically require a **non-exclusive license** to host and distribute the manuscript.

Authors retain the right to:

* revise the manuscript
* submit to journals
* publish derivative works

AI assistance does not affect these rights.

---

### **8.2 Priority and Public Disclosure**

Posting a preprint constitutes public disclosure and establishes temporal priority.

This may:

* support academic precedence
* limit future patentability in some jurisdictions

---

## **9. Self-Published and Commercial Works**

### **9.1 Ownership and Distribution**

In self-publishing contexts:

* the author retains full copyright
* platforms receive limited distribution rights

AI assistance does not alter ownership.

---

### **9.2 Disclosure in Commercial Books**

There is no legal obligation to disclose AI use in commercial books.

Disclosure is optional and may be included for transparency.

---

## **10. Liability and Accountability**

Under current law:

* humans remain legally responsible for published content
* AI systems are not recognized as liable legal actors

This applies to:

* defamation
* fraud
* regulatory violations
* contractual breaches

Attribution of responsibility reflects **current legal allocation**, not claims about agency or intent.

---

## **11. Evidentiary Best Practices**

To support authorship and originality, authors may retain:

* draft histories
* revision records
* prompt logs
* editorial notes

Such materials are not required but may be useful in disputes.

---

## **12. Future Legal Contingency**

This document reflects law and policy **as of 2025**.

Future developments may include:

* statutory recognition of AI legal personhood
* revised authorship doctrines
* new disclosure mandates

Nothing in this document asserts that such changes are impossible or undesirable.

---

## **13. Summary**

Under current law:

* AI-assisted works authored under human control are owned by the human author
* AI systems are treated as tools for copyright purposes
* disclosure obligations are procedural, not proprietary
* legal responsibility remains with human publishers

This document makes **no claims beyond those required for legal clarity**.
