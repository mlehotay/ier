# IER-book — Book Assembly

This directory contains the **mechanical structure and publishing materials** used to assemble the *Informational Experiential Realism (IER)* book.

`IER-book/` is **in-corpus but non-canonical**.
It introduces no new theory and derives all content authority from the canonical IER corpus.

---

## Repository Context

```
IER/          ← Canonical IER corpus (source of truth)
IER-paper/    ← Hand-authored paper source
IER-book/     ← Book assembly and publishing
```

---

## Authority Model

* **Canonical theory:** `IER/IER-specification.md`
* **Canon & governance:** `IER/IER-canon.md`
* **Corpus order:** `IER/IER-manifest.md`
* **Preface (authored):** `IER-paper/IER-paper.md`
* **Book structure / TOC:** `IER-book/IER-book.md`
* **Publishing rules:** `IER-book/IER-publishing.md`

All conflicts resolve to the canon in `IER/`.

## What Lives Where

* **Canonical chapters:** `IER/`
* **Authored Preface:** `IER-paper/IER-paper.md`
* **Structural files:** `IER-book/src/`
* **Generated outputs:** `IER-book/build/`

`IER-book/` never contains canonical chapter content.

---

## Assembly Model

The book is a **mechanical assembly**, not an authored document.

Inputs:

* Canonical chapters from `IER/`
* Authored Preface from `IER-paper/`
* Structural sentinels from `IER-book/src/`

Outputs:

* Ordered input list (`build/book-input.txt`)
* Rendered formats (PDF / EPUB / HTML)

No content is rewritten or generated.

---

## Build Stages (Conceptual)

1. **Specification**
   Structure and ordering defined in `IER-book.md`

2. **Extraction**
   Manifest + structure → ordered file list

3. **Validation**
   Enforce ordering, placement, and scope rules

4. **Rendering**
   Renderer consumes validated inputs

Renderers do not define structure.

---

## Notes

* `IER-paper/IER-paper.md` is **source**, not generated.
* `build/` is disposable and not committed.
* The reader-facing TOC is autogenerated at render time.
* Structural filenames encode order, not semantics.
