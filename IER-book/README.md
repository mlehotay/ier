# IER-book — Book Assembly

This directory contains the **structural and publishing materials** used to assemble the *Informational Experiential Realism (IER)* book.

`IER-book/` is **in-corpus but non-canonical**.
It introduces **no new theory** and derives all content authority from the canonical IER corpus.

---

## Repository Context

```
IER/          ← Canonical IER corpus (source of truth)
IER-paper/    ← Paper source (non-canonical)
IER-book/     ← Book assembly and publishing
```

---

## Authority Model

* **Normative authority:** [`IER/IER-specification.md`](../IER/IER-specification.md)
* **Canon & governance:** [`IER/IER-canon.md`](../IER/IER-canon.md)
* **Corpus inventory:** [`IER/IER-manifest.md`](../IER/IER-manifest.md)
* **Preface source:** [`IER-paper/IER-paper.md`](../IER-paper/IER-paper.md)
* **Publishing rules:** [`IER-publishing.md`](IER-publishing.md)
* **Release plan:** [`IER-deployment.md`](IER-deployment.md)
* **Legal / IP reference:** [`IER-legal.md`](IER-legal.md)

All conflicts resolve to the canon in `IER/`.

## What Lives Where

* **Canonical chapters:** `IER/`
* **Preface source:** `IER-paper/IER-paper.md`
* **Structural files:** `IER-book/src/`
* **Generated artifacts:** `IER-book/build/`

`IER-book/` never contains canonical chapter content.

---

## Assembly Model

The book is a **mechanical assembly**, not an authored document.

### Inputs

* Canonical chapters from `IER/`
* Preface from `IER-paper/`
* Structural sentinels from `IER-book/src/`

### Outputs

* Ordered input list: `build/book-input.txt`
* Rendered formats (PDF / EPUB / HTML)

No content is rewritten or generated.

---

## Build Discipline

* `build/book-input.txt` is the **sole ordered input** consumed by renderers
* Ordering is derived from `IER-manifest.md` and structural sentinels
* Reader-facing tables of contents are autogenerated at render time
* Renderers do not define structure or authority

---

## Notes

* Canonical content lives **only** in `IER/`
* The Preface is source material, not a build artifact
* `build/` is disposable and not committed
* Structural filenames encode **order**, not semantics
* Publishing, deployment, and legal documents govern **process**, not theory

---

## Summary

`IER-book/` exists to support **stable, authority-clean assembly and publication** of the IER book.

It is infrastructure, not authorship.
