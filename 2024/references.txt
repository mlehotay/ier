  - **Summary**: In this influential paper, Thomas Nagel explores the subjective character of consciousness and argues that subjective experiences or "what it is like" to be something cannot be fully captured or understood from an objective, third-person perspective.

- Jackson, F. (1982). "Epiphenomenal Qualia". The Philosophical Quarterly, 32(127), 127-136.
  - **Summary**: In this classic paper, Frank Jackson presents the "knowledge argument" against physicalism by introducing a thought experiment involving a neuroscientist named Mary who knows everything there is to know about the science of color vision but gains new knowledge about the subjective experience of seeing color when she experiences color for the first time.

These papers by Thomas Nagel and Frank Jackson are seminal works in the philosophy of consciousness and are essential readings for anyone interested in exploring the subjective character of consciousness, the challenges posed by qualia to physicalist accounts of mind, and the broader debates and discussions surrounding the nature of consciousness and subjective experience.

Recent neuroscience recognizes two basic forms of consciousness. It all starts with the divisions we make: "Two broad types of consciousness must be distinguished" based on the neurobiological domain (LeDoux, 2023, 219). Creature consciousness is attributed to all organisms with a nervous system. The other form of consciousness, associated with more complex nervous systems, is mental state consciousness. It is "the ability to experience the world and one's relationship to it" (LeDoux, 219).

Recently, another category of consciousness has been added: existential consciousness. (Reber, Baluska and Miller, 2024). Here, consciousness is rooted in cellular intelligence as an expression of a living, self-organizing order.

An alternative perspective is emerging: one in which life and consciousness are intertwined in a coordinated cognitive ecology (Reber et al, 2024). This is true for the single cell organism as well as for the billion cell organism that we are. We are intimately connected to this natural intelligence. The consciousness we experience as humans today is the expression of a natural intelligence that began 4 billion years ago. We are deeply rooted in life. In contrast to panpsychism, which claims that consciousness is everywhere, this view, based on a deep continuity between living and knowing, offers a valuable perspective from which to view the deep planetary crises created by humanity.

It is the deep integration between visceral bodily functions and somatic interactions with the external world that drives our life story. Our neurons are built around this living order: "...it is the very reason the nervous system exists" (LeDoux, 2023, 109). From our complex mental state consciousness, it is hard to imagine the sentience of a single-celled organism.

The article by Patrick De Vleeschauwer Drs. discusses three types of consciousness as recognized by neuroscience:

Creature Consciousness: This form of consciousness is attributed to all organisms with a nervous system. It is the basic form of consciousness that allows these organisms to perceive and interact with their environment. Creature consciousness enables organisms to experience the world around them and respond to stimuli.

Mental State Consciousness: This is a more complex form of consciousness associated with organisms that have more developed and intricate nervous systems. Mental state consciousness allows for a deeper understanding and interpretation of the world, including the ability to form thoughts, emotions, and self-awareness. It is "the ability to experience the world and one's relationship to it."

Existential Consciousness: This is a newer category of consciousness introduced in the article. It is rooted in cellular intelligence and is seen as an expression of living, self-organizing order. Existential consciousness suggests that consciousness may not be limited to organisms with nervous systems but can also be found at the cellular level. This perspective challenges traditional views that link consciousness solely to the presence of a nervous system.
