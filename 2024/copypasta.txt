**Summary of Discussion on Consciousness and Theories**

### Key Points and Views Explored:

1. **Nature of Consciousness**
   - Explored the subjective and objective aspects of consciousness.
   - Discussed the role of qualia, emotions, motivations, attention, and other factors in shaping conscious experience.

2. **Theories of Consciousness**
   - **Materialism**: Consciousness arises from physical processes in the brain.
   - **Dualism**: Posits a separation between the mental (non-physical) and the physical realms.
   - **Panpsychism**: Consciousness is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of reality.
   - **Dual-aspect Monism**: Consciousness has both mental and physical aspects.
   - **Emergentism**: Consciousness is an emergent property that arises from complex interactions in the brain.
   - **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**: Consciousness arises from the integration of information in a complex system.
   - **Global Workspace Theory (GWT)**: Consciousness involves the global broadcasting and integration of information in the brain.

3. **Qualia and Subjective Experience**
   - Explored the concept of qualia as the atomic components of subjective experience.
   - Discussed how qualia combine and interact to form our conscious experiences.

4. **Cognitive Qualia and Consciousness**
   - Explored the term "cognitive qualia" and its potential meaning in the context of consciousness.

5. **Philosophical Perspectives**
   - Discussed the views presented by Thomas Nagel in "What Is it Like to Be a Bat?" regarding the subjective character of consciousness.
   - Explored Frank Jackson's "Epiphenomenal Qualia" and the "knowledge argument" against physicalism.
   - Discussed De Vleeschauwer's recent article on different forms of consciousness: creature consciousness, mental state consciousness, and existential consciousness.

6. **Everyday Intuitions and Philosophical Theories**
   - Explored the intuitive understanding of consciousness as involving both "hearts and minds" or "thoughts and feelings."
   - Discussed how this everyday intuition aligns with and complements more formal theories and perspectives on consciousness.

### Theories to Consider in New Session:

- **Emergentism**: Explores consciousness as an emergent property from complex interactions in the brain.
  
- **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**: Views consciousness as arising from the integration of information in a complex system.
  
- **Global Workspace Theory (GWT)**: Proposes that consciousness involves the global broadcasting and integration of information in the brain.

- **De Vleeschauwer's Perspective**: Explores the distinctions between creature consciousness, mental state consciousness, and existential consciousness, and emphasizes the deep integration between consciousness, life, and natural intelligence.

**Summary of Chart: Cognitive Abilities by System Complexity**

### Cognitive Abilities by System Complexity:

| Level | Level of Consciousness | Biological Systems |
|-------|-------------------------|--------------------|
| 1     | Non-living entities     | Inanimate Objects (Rock, Soil, Water) |
| 2     | Biological processes, growth, reproduction, response to stimuli | Single-Celled Organisms (Bacteria, Protozoa, Some Algae) |
| 3     | Chemical communication with environment | Multicellular Organisms without Nervous System (Plants, Fungi, Some Algae) |
| 4     | Responsiveness, movement, complex interactions with environment | Animals with Simple Nervous System (Jellyfish, Sea Anemones, Sponges) |
| 5     | Sensations, feelings, subjective experiences, tool use, social structures | Animals with Advanced Nervous System (Fish, Amphibians, Reptiles, Birds, Mammals, Some Cephalopods, Some Arthropods) |
| 6     | Sense of self, culture, problem-solving, emotions | Highly Intelligent and Self-Aware Animals (Great Apes, Dolphins, Elephants, Parrots, Octopi) |
| 7     | Reasoning, abstract thinking, language, creativity | Humans |

### Expanded Definition of Life:

**Dr. Paul Davies and Dr. Charles Lineweaver**
- **Complexity**: Life involves complex systems with multiple interacting components and emergent properties.
- **Information Storage and Processing**: Life requires the ability to store, process, and transmit information to control and regulate its internal organization, behavior, and interactions with the environment.
- **Energy Utilization and Metabolism**: Life relies on energy sources and metabolic processes to maintain its organization, sustain its activities, and support growth, development, and reproduction.
- **Adaptation and Evolution**: Life has the ability to adapt to changes in the environment and evolve over time through natural selection, mutation, and genetic variation.
- **Environmental Interaction and Homeostasis**: Life interacts with its environment, responds to stimuli, and maintains homeostasis to regulate its internal conditions and optimize its survival and reproductive success.
