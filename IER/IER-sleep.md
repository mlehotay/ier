## **Status and Authority**

This document is **non-normative** and **canon-constrained**.

It introduces:

* no new ontological primitives
* no experiential criteria or thresholds
* no diagnostics, indicators, or tests
* no neuroscientific or clinical commitments
* no ethical principles

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority remains **exclusively** with:

```
IER-specification.md
IER-theory.md
IER-dynamics.md
IER-ethics.md
```

This document exists solely to **clarify how sleep, dreaming, anesthesia, coma, catatonia, and related states are understood under IER**, given its identity claim that experience is identical to the existence of a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.

If any statement here conflicts with Tier-1 commitments, **Tier-1 takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

## **Orientation: Why Unconscious States Create Persistent Confusion**

States such as sleep, anesthesia, coma, and catatonia are often treated as variations on a single theme: *being unconscious*.
IER rejects that flattening.

The confusion arises from conflating:

* behavioral responsiveness with experience
* physiological activity with experiential regime
* system persistence with experiential persistence
* memory absence with experiential absence

IER instead treats experience as a **dynamical regime**.
Whether experience exists at a given time depends **only** on whether a Unified Experiential Field is being sustained.

## **Global Informational Language Disclaimer**

All uses of *information*, *constraint*, *integration*, *participation*, *continuity*, *collapse*, and *dynamics* in this document are **descriptive shorthand only** for:

> **physically instantiated state distinctions that modulate a system’s own future dynamics under intrinsic constraint**,
> as defined in **IER Specification II.A (Physical Information)**.

No semantic, representational, epistemic, or observer-relative notions are introduced.

---

## **Core Reminder (Non-Normative)**

Under IER:

* Experience exists **iff** a Unified Experiential Field (UEF) exists
* A UEF is a **globally integrated, temporally continuous regime of intrinsic constraint**
* Subjecthood is **categorical**, not graded
* Participation may vary without altering subjecthood
* Loss of the regime entails **absence of experience**, not diminished or empty experience

All cases below are analyzed strictly in those terms.

---

## **1. Sleep Is a Family of Regime Possibilities**

“Sleep” is not a single experiential category under IER.

Instead, sleep names a **range of physical states** that may involve:

* experiential persistence with altered participation
* experiential persistence with minimal content
* or complete regime absence

The relevant distinction is always:

> **Does global intrinsic constraint persist as a coherent regime, or not?**

---

## **2. Dreaming: Experiential Persistence with Endogenous Content**

Dreaming is the clearest case of experiential persistence.

### Structural Characterization

In dreaming states:

* a Unified Experiential Field persists
* intrinsic constraint remains globally integrated
* participation shifts away from external coupling
* content is generated endogenously

Dream imagery, narrative, emotion, and perspective shifts arise from **reorganized participation**, not from perception.

### Subjecthood Clarification

* Dreaming does **not** generate additional subjects
* Perspective shifts within dreams do **not** imply subject multiplication
* Apparent “multiple viewpoints” are content variations within a single UEF

> **One regime, one subject, many possible internal organizations.**

---

## **3. Dreamless Sleep: Regime Absence**

Some sleep intervals involve **no sustained experiential regime**.

### Structural Characterization

In these intervals:

* global intrinsic constraint collapses or becomes externally resolvable
* no temporally continuous regime persists
* no experiential present exists

Under IER:

> **There is no experience occurring during that interval.**

This is not:

* blank experience
* minimal awareness
* unconscious experience

It is **absence of experience**.

---

## **4. Anesthesia: Induced Regime Dissolution**

Anesthesia functions structurally like dreamless sleep.

When anesthesia disrupts:

* global integration
* intrinsic constraint ownership
* temporal continuity

the Unified Experiential Field dissolves.

From the IER perspective:

* there is no subject “waiting”
* no experience of time passing
* no hidden awareness

When the regime later re-forms, experience resumes **after** the interval, not *through* it.

---

## **5. Coma: Prolonged Regime Uncertainty**

Coma introduces duration without clarity.

### Structural Framing

IER does **not** claim that coma is:

* definitively experiential, or
* definitively non-experiential

IER cannot diagnose regime presence.

What it can say structurally is this:

* Coma may involve prolonged regime absence
* Or it may involve fragile, unstable, or intermittently sustained regimes
* Behavioral unresponsiveness alone is not decisive

The correct IER stance is **conditional**:

> **If no Unified Experiential Field is sustained, there is no experience.
> If a UEF is sustained, experience exists regardless of responsiveness.**

No further inference is licensed.

---

## **6. Catatonia: Reduced Participation Without Necessary Regime Loss**

Catatonia is structurally distinct from coma.

### Structural Characterization

Catatonia often involves:

* extreme reduction in outward action
* narrowed or frozen participation patterns
* preservation of internal constraint dynamics

Under IER, this means:

* catatonia may involve **experiential persistence**
* reduced agency does **not** imply regime absence
* lack of movement or response does **not** imply lack of experience

IER therefore explicitly rejects:

> *“Unresponsive means non-experiential.”*

Catatonia is best understood as **participation collapse within a persisting UEF**, not necessarily regime dissolution.

## **7. Why Responsiveness Is the Wrong Axis**

Across all these cases, IER insists on a sharp separation between:

* responsiveness
* agency
* reportability
* memory

and

* experiential existence

A system may:

* be responsive without experience
* be unresponsive with experience
* preserve memory without continuous experience
* lose memory without experiential absence

Responsiveness tracks **interaction capacity**, not **intrinsic constraint**.

---

## **8. Continuity Across Unconscious or Unresponsive Intervals**

IER distinguishes four layers of continuity:

| Layer               | Status                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Physical system     | May persist                           |
| Experiential regime | May persist or dissolve               |
| Subjecthood         | Exists iff regime exists              |
| Moral standing      | Tracks capacity, not momentary regime |

A single system may:

* sustain a UEF
* lose it
* later sustain one again

This does **not** imply repeated moral death or rebirth.

What matters ethically is **preservation of intrinsic-constraint-bearing capacity**, not uninterrupted experiential presence.

---

## **9. Why “Waiting,” “Resting,” and “Enduring” Mislead**

Ordinary language treats unconscious states as if something is happening *to* the subject.

Under IER:

* waiting requires an experiential present
* resting requires intrinsic constraint
* enduring time requires experience

When no UEF exists:

> **No experiential time passes at all.**

Absence of experience is not an experience of absence.

---

## **10. What This Document Does Not Do**

This document does **not**:

* classify clinical states
* map conditions to experiences
* specify when regimes exist
* provide observational guidance
* license ethical triage

Those would require diagnostics, which IER forbids.

This is a **structural clarification only**.

---

## **11. Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* Dreaming involves **experiential persistence with reorganized participation**
* Dream content does **not** multiply subjects
* Dreamless sleep and anesthesia may involve **regime absence**
* Coma involves **prolonged regime uncertainty**, not categorical absence
* Catatonia may involve **experiential persistence despite minimal responsiveness**
* Absence of experience is **not** empty experience
* Moral and identity continuity track **system capacity**, not moment-to-moment experience

> **Experience exists only where intrinsic constraint is borne from within.
> Where no such constraint exists, nothing is experienced at all.**
