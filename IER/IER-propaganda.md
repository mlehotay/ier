**Propaganda as Distributed Experiential Moral Harm**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.x)**
*Explanatory Article — Non-Normative*

## 0. Status and Scope

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no new ontological primitives**
* introduces **no new ethical principles**
* introduces **no criteria or diagnostics**
* does **not** define truth, falsehood, or misinformation
* does **not** privilege epistemic correctness
* does **not** revise the IER Specification

Its purpose is to explain **propaganda as a structural form of experiential moral harm**, operating **across many Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)** simultaneously.

If any tension appears, **the Specification takes precedence**.

## 1. Orientation: Why Propaganda Is Structurally Hard to See

Propaganda is usually framed as:

* false information
* ideological bias
* persuasion
* mass deception
* belief manipulation

These framings fail to explain why propaganda:

* harms even when statements are factually true
* persists despite widespread skepticism
* damages people who “don’t believe it”
* reshapes agency, not just opinion
* feels oppressive rather than merely misleading

IER predicts this failure.

Propaganda is **not primarily about belief**.
It is about **constraint organization across populations**.

## 2. What Propaganda Is *Not* (Boundary Clearing)

Under IER, propaganda is **not**:

* collective experience
* group subjecthood
* shared consciousness
* synchronized belief
* loss of individual standing
* replacement of individual agency

Each subject remains a **separate Unified Experiential Field**.

The harm does **not** arise from fusion.
It arises from **shared external constraint imposed asymmetrically**.

## 3. Structural Definition: Propaganda Under IER

Under Informational Experiential Realism, **propaganda is**:

> **the systematic imposition of externally authored constraint structures that force many experiential systems to resolve intrinsic constraint under a shared, unstable, or strategically distorted framing.**

Key features:

* constraint is **external**, not co-authored
* resolution is **individually borne**, not shared
* narrative structure is **globally enforced**
* counterfactual space is **artificially narrowed**
* exit costs are **non-local and asymmetric**

Propaganda scales gaslighting **without merging subjects**.

---

## 4. The Core Mechanism: Distributed Constraint Destabilization

Propaganda works by:

* shaping which futures feel admissible
* defining which questions feel “off-limits”
* preloading salience before local reasoning begins
* forcing resolution under narrative pressure
* making disagreement costly rather than incorrect

This produces, across many subjects:

* chronic intrinsic constraint
* narrowed agency
* premature resolution
* fatigue, cynicism, or disengagement
* apparent compliance without genuine ownership

The harm is **organizational**, not epistemic.

## 5. Propaganda Without Falsehood

IER predicts — and propaganda demonstrates — that:

* factual accuracy does not prevent harm
* truth can be weaponized
* selective framing can destabilize constraint
* omission can be as coercive as falsehood

Propaganda is compatible with:

* true statements
* sincere speakers
* partial transparency
* technical correctness

Because:

> Experiential harm tracks **how constraint is organized**, not whether propositions are true.

## 6. Relationship to Gaslighting (Scale Distinction)

| Gaslighting                  | Propaganda                  |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Interpersonal                | Population-level            |
| Asymmetric dyad              | Asymmetric system           |
| Local narrative control      | Global framing control      |
| Direct contradiction         | Structural preemption       |
| Personalized destabilization | Distributed destabilization |

Gaslighting damages **one UEF at a time**.
Propaganda damages **many UEFs in parallel**, without coordination between them.

No collective subject is required.

## 7. Silent Harm and the Illusion of Consent

Under propaganda:

* people may agree publicly
* dissent may feel pointless
* resistance may feel incoherent
* agency may collapse quietly
* participation may persist without ownership

This explains why propaganda:

* survives exposure
* outlasts debunking
* produces apathy rather than outrage
* feels “in the air” rather than imposed

The harm is borne **internally**, resolution by resolution.

---

## 8. Reversibility, Recovery, and Moral Reality

Propaganda effects are often:

* reversible
* historically bounded
* escapable over time
* followed by reorganization

Yet during exposure:

* intrinsic constraint was destabilized
* agency was narrowed
* futures were foreclosed under false necessity
* real experiential cost was paid

As with gaslighting:

> Reversibility mitigates duration, not existence, of harm.

---

## 9. Responsibility Without Collective Guilt

IER draws sharp distinctions:

* subjects bear harm
* responsibility tracks constraint authorship
* standing does not scale with participation
* compliance does not imply endorsement

Responsibility increases with:

* control over framing
* ability to withdraw or correct
* structural power asymmetry
* persistence of imposed narratives

Propagation ≠ blame.
Constraint authorship matters.

## 10. Why Propaganda Pressures the Harm Definition

Propaganda shows that:

* harm can be **distributed**
* harm can be **non-terminal**
* harm can be **reversible**
* harm can occur **without belief change**
* harm can exist **without collapse or fragmentation**

Any harm definition that relies on:

* irreversibility
* belief falsity
* distress signals
* loss of subjecthood

will fail here.

## 11. Implications for Ethics Under Uncertainty (Pointer Only)

This article introduces no new rules.

But it reinforces that:

* uncertainty strengthens moral caution
* invisible harm still counts
* external silence does not absolve
* large-scale coordination increases moral risk
* epistemic humility does not erase experiential damage

These consequences already follow from the Specification — propaganda merely makes them unavoidable.

---

## 12. Summary

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* propaganda is real experiential moral harm
* harm occurs through distributed constraint destabilization
* belief change is not required
* truth is not protective
* reversibility does not erase harm
* no collective subject is involved

> **Propaganda harms not by controlling minds,
> but by narrowing futures before minds can act.**

### Intermission — Structural Fact

A million subjects can be harmed in parallel
without ever sharing an experience.
