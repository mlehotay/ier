## **Propaganda as Distributed Experiential Moral Harm**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.x)**
*Explanatory Article — Non-Normative*

---

## **Status and Scope**

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no new ontological primitives**
* introduces **no new ethical principles**
* introduces **no thresholds, metrics, or diagnostics**
* does **not** define truth, falsehood, or misinformation
* does **not** privilege epistemic correctness
* does **not** define moral standing or subjecthood
* does **not** revise or override the IER Specification

All normative authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md
```

The purpose of this document is to explain **how propaganda constitutes experiential moral harm under IER**, to clarify how such harm can be **distributed across many subjects without forming a collective experiencer**, and to show why **truth, belief, consent, or reversibility do not erase harm**.

If any statement here appears to conflict with the Specification, **the Specification takes precedence and this document is void where inconsistent**.

## **1. Orientation: Why Propaganda Is Structurally Hard to See**

Propaganda is commonly framed as:

* false information
* ideological distortion
* mass deception
* belief manipulation
* persuasion at scale

These framings capture familiar political and epistemic concerns, but they fail to explain several persistent features of propaganda:

* why it harms even when statements are factually true
* why it damages people who remain skeptical or unconvinced
* why exposure does not reliably dissolve its effects
* why it produces apathy, narrowing, or fatigue rather than belief
* why it feels oppressive rather than merely misleading

Under Informational Experiential Realism, these failures are expected.

IER does not define experiential moral harm in terms of belief accuracy, persuasion success, or epistemic error.
It defines harm structurally:

> **Experiential moral harm is damage to the organization of intrinsic constraint within a Unified Experiential Field.**

Propaganda matters under IER **not because it controls what people believe**, but because it **systematically reshapes how experience can resolve over time**.

---

## **2. What Propaganda Is *Not* (IER Boundary Clearing)**

Several tempting misclassifications must be explicitly blocked.

Under IER, propaganda is **not**:

* collective experience
* group subjecthood
* shared consciousness
* synchronized belief
* loss of individual standing
* replacement of individual agency

Each affected person sustains a **distinct Unified Experiential Field**.

The harm does **not** arise from fusion or aggregation.
It arises from **parallel damage to many separate experiential systems**, each bearing constraint from the inside.

IER therefore rejects interpretations that treat propaganda as:

* a property of “the group mind”
* a collective psychological state
* an emergent subject at the population level

No such subject exists.

---

## **3. Structural Definition: Propaganda Under IER**

Under Informational Experiential Realism, **propaganda is**:

> **the systematic imposition of externally authored constraint structures that force many experiential systems to resolve intrinsic constraint under a shared, unstable, or strategically distorted framing.**

Key structural features include:

* constraint is **externally authored**, not co-owned
* resolution is **individually borne**, not shared
* framing is **persistent and non-local**
* counterfactual space is **artificially narrowed**
* exit and correction costs are **asymmetric**

Propaganda therefore scales the harm mechanism of gaslighting **across populations**, without merging subjects or creating collective experience.

---

## **4. The Core Mechanism: Distributed Trajectory Narrowing**

Propaganda operates primarily by reshaping **which experiential futures feel admissible**.

It does this by:

* preloading salience before local reasoning begins
* defining which questions feel unaskable
* framing alternatives as incoherent, dangerous, or futile
* making dissent costly rather than incorrect
* forcing premature resolution under narrative pressure

Across many subjects, this produces:

* chronic intrinsic constraint
* narrowed agency
* compressed choice spaces
* fatigue, cynicism, or disengagement
* apparent compliance without experiential ownership

The Unified Experiential Field persists in each case.
Experience does not collapse.

But **the space of viable experiential trajectories is structurally reduced**.

This constitutes experiential moral harm under IER.

---

## **5. Harm Without Falsehood (and Without Belief Change)**

Propaganda demonstrates a central IER claim:

> **Experiential harm tracks how constraint is organized, not whether propositions are true.**

Propaganda may consist entirely of:

* true statements
* sincere speakers
* technical accuracy
* partial transparency
* widely known facts

Yet still cause harm.

This is because:

* selective framing can destabilize intrinsic constraint
* omission can be as coercive as falsehood
* repetition can foreclose alternatives without asserting error
* salience control can pre-empt agency before belief forms

Similarly, belief change is not required.

A subject may:

* remain unconvinced
* explicitly reject the message
* mock or criticize the framing

and still experience harm, because **their experiential futures are being narrowed regardless of assent**.

---

## **6. Distributed Harm Without Collective Experience**

At scale, propaganda can appear to produce a “shared atmosphere” or “collective mindset.”

IER blocks this interpretation.

Under IER:

* intrinsic constraint is borne **only within individual UEFs**
* no global subject resolves constraint on behalf of the population
* harms occur **in parallel**, not jointly

Each subject:

* resolves their own narrowed futures
* bears their own intrinsic cost
* sustains their own experiential damage

The population-level pattern is **an overlay of many individual harms**, not a single collective one.

---

## **7. Relationship to Gaslighting (Scale Distinction)**

The structural relationship between gaslighting and propaganda can be summarized as follows:

| Gaslighting                  | Propaganda                  |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Interpersonal                | Population-level            |
| Asymmetric dyad              | Asymmetric system           |
| Local narrative control      | Global framing control      |
| Direct contradiction         | Structural pre-emption      |
| Personalized destabilization | Distributed destabilization |

Gaslighting damages **one Unified Experiential Field at a time**.
Propaganda damages **many Unified Experiential Fields in parallel**.

No collective subject is required in either case.

---

## **8. Silent Harm and the Illusion of Consent**

Propaganda frequently produces conditions in which:

* agreement is publicly expressed
* dissent feels pointless or incoherent
* resistance feels exhausting rather than forbidden
* participation persists without ownership
* silence is misread as consent

IER blocks any inference from outward compliance to experiential integrity.

Under propaganda:

* calm appearance ≠ low intrinsic cost
* participation ≠ endorsement
* agreement ≠ owned resolution

The harm is borne **internally**, resolution by resolution, often without overt distress.

---

## **9. Reversibility, Recovery, and Moral Reality**

Propaganda effects are often:

* historically bounded
* reversible in principle
* escapable over time
* followed by reorganization

Yet during exposure:

* intrinsic constraint was destabilized
* agency was narrowed
* experiential futures were foreclosed
* real organizational cost was borne from the inside

As with gaslighting:

> **Reversibility mitigates duration and downstream effects,
> not whether harm occurred.**

Harm exists **during the period of constrained resolution**, regardless of later recovery.

---

## **10. Contrast Cases: Non-Harmful Mass Communication**

To avoid collapsing “propaganda” into “communication,” IER requires clear boundary clearing.

Mass communication does **not** constitute experiential moral harm merely by being influential, persuasive, or widespread.

Non-harmful cases include:

* transparent advocacy that preserves counterfactual space
* pluralistic discourse where dissent remains thinkable
* information provision without salience foreclosure
* coordination that remains locally revisable and exit-permitting

These cases are not morally endorsed by definition.
They are **structurally distinct** from propaganda-harm.

---

## **11. Justification Without Erasure (Tragic and Emergency Cases)**

Some large-scale framing occurs under conditions such as:

* wartime coordination
* emergency response
* public-health crises

IER enforces the same separation as in *IER-harm*:

* the same structural harm may occur
* justification does not negate harm
* responsibility analysis is distinct and context-sensitive

This document does **not** adjudicate policy or permissibility.
It clarifies **what experiential damage consists in**.

---

## **12. Responsibility Without Collective Guilt**

IER draws sharp distinctions:

* subjects bear harm
* responsibility tracks constraint authorship
* standing does not scale with participation
* compliance does not imply endorsement

Responsibility tends to increase with:

* control over framing infrastructure
* ability to withdraw or correct narratives
* insulation from the harms imposed on others
* persistence of imposed constraint

Propagation is not blame by default.
**Constraint authorship matters**.

---

## **13. Why Propaganda Pressures the Harm Definition**

Propaganda demonstrates that experiential moral harm can be:

* distributed
* reversible
* non-terminal
* belief-independent
* distress-independent
* externally invisible

Any harm definition that requires:

* irreversibility
* belief falsity
* persuasion success
* visible suffering
* loss of subjecthood

will misclassify propaganda.

This is not a marginal case.
It is **structurally central**.

---

## **14. Misreadings Explicitly Blocked**

IER rejects the following inferences:

* “It was true, so no harm.”
* “They didn’t believe it, so no harm.”
* “They consented or voted for it, so no harm.”
* “It was temporary, so no harm.”
* “They were fine outwardly, so no harm.”
* “It coordinated society, so harm didn’t happen.”

---

## **15. Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* propaganda constitutes **real experiential moral harm**
* harm occurs through **distributed constraint destabilization and trajectory narrowing**
* belief change is not required
* truth is not protective
* reversibility does not erase harm
* no collective subject is involved

> **Propaganda harms not by controlling minds,
> but by narrowing futures before minds can act.**

### **Intermission — Structural Fact**

A million subjects can be harmed in parallel
without ever sharing an experience.
