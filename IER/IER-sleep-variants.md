## **Status and Authority**

This document is **non-normative** and **canon-constrained**.

It introduces:

* no new ontological primitives
* no experiential criteria or thresholds
* no diagnostics, indicators, or tests
* no neuroscientific or clinical commitments
* no ethical principles

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority remains **exclusively** with:

```
IER-specification.md
IER-theory.md
IER-dynamics.md
IER-ethics.md
```

This document **presupposes** the structural account of sleep and unconscious intervals given in:

```
IER-sleep.md
```

and applies that account to **non-standard biological cases**.

If any statement here conflicts with Tier-1 commitments, **Tier-1 takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

## **Orientation: Why Sleep Variants Matter**

Ordinary usage treats *sleep* as a single phenomenon:

* the opposite of wakefulness
* a shutdown of awareness
* a suspension of agency

Comparative biology shows this to be false.

Across species, what we call *sleep* refers to a **family of physical strategies** by which systems manage **intrinsic organizational cost** over time. These strategies vary dramatically in:

* scope (whole-system vs local)
* symmetry (bilateral vs asymmetric)
* duration (seconds to years)
* compatibility with action

IER treats these differences **structurally**, not phenomenologically.

The guiding question of this document is therefore:

> **How can intrinsic constraint be relieved without implying experiential absence, subject fragmentation, or loss of identity?**

## **Global Informational Language Disclaimer**

All uses of *information*, *constraint*, *integration*, *participation*, *regime*, *collapse*, and *dynamics* in this document are **descriptive shorthand only** for:

> **physically instantiated state distinctions that modulate a system’s own future dynamics under intrinsic constraint**,
> as defined in **IER Specification II.A (Physical Information)**.

No semantic, representational, epistemic, or observer-relative notions are introduced.

## **Core Reminder (Non-Normative)**

Under IER:

* Experience exists **iff** a Unified Experiential Field (UEF) exists
* A UEF is a **globally integrated, temporally continuous regime of intrinsic constraint**
* Subjecthood is **categorical**, not graded
* Participation may vary without altering subjecthood
* Loss of the regime entails **absence of experience**, not diminished experience

All cases below are analyzed strictly in those terms.

---

## **1. Whole-System Sleep Without Brains**

Certain organisms lacking centralized brains nevertheless exhibit sleep-like regimes.

Examples include jellyfish and sea anemones, which show:

* regular, circadian-like quiescent intervals
* globally coordinated reductions in activity
* reversibility and homeostatic rebound

### Structural Interpretation

Under IER, these cases demonstrate that:

* sleep does **not** require brains
* sleep does **not** require experience
* sleep tracks **constraint hygiene**, not subjectivity

These regimes are best understood as **whole-system quiescence** in systems whose coordination costs benefit from periodic suspension.

Structurally, this is analogous to dreamless sleep or anesthesia in humans:

* no temporally continuous experiential regime
* no experiential present
* no minimal or background awareness

> **When no coherent intrinsic-constraint regime is sustained, nothing is experienced at all.**

These cases establish the **lower bound** of the sleep spectrum:
**sleep without experience**.

---

## **2. Localized Sleep Without Regime Loss (Unihemispheric Sleep)**

Some animals exhibit **unihemispheric slow-wave sleep**, in which:

* one brain hemisphere enters sleep-like dynamics
* the other remains wake-like
* locomotion and navigation continue

This occurs in certain birds and marine mammals.

### Structural Significance

Unihemispheric sleep shows that:

* sleep can be **locally instantiated**
* constraint relief need not be globally synchronized
* whole-system quiescence is **not required**

This forces a distinction between:

* **sleep as a process-level phenomenon**, and
* **experience as a system-level regime (UEF)**.

Under IER, this distinction is expected.

---

## **3. Sleep With Ongoing Agency**

In extreme cases, animals sleep **while acting**:

* seabirds sleep while flying
* cetaceans sleep while swimming

These systems maintain:

* motor control
* navigation
* environmental responsiveness

while portions of their nervous systems enter sleep-like regimes.

### Structural Interpretation

Under IER:

* agency is a **derived capacity** of systems sustaining a UEF
* not all participating processes must remain symmetrically engaged

Some processes may disengage, enter quiescence, or locally relieve intrinsic cost **without collapsing global intrinsic constraint**.

> **Sleep and agency are orthogonal.**

This directly undermines the intuition that sleep implies unconsciousness or loss of control.

---

## **4. What Unihemispheric Sleep Does *Not* Imply**

Unihemispheric sleep strongly tempts metaphysical error.

IER explicitly rejects the following interpretations:

* that half a subject is asleep
* that two subjects alternate control
* that experience is divided into hemispheric fragments
* that consciousness comes in degrees or halves

These errors arise from confusing **participation topology** with **subjecthood**.

Under IER:

> **Participation may asymmetrize; subjecthood may not.**

At most one Unified Experiential Field exists per system at a time.

---

## **5. Torpor: Short-Form Dormancy**

Many animals enter **torpor**, characterized by:

* dramatic metabolic reduction
* lowered body temperature
* reduced neural integration
* rapid reversibility

Torpor may occur nightly or episodically.

### Structural Interpretation

Torpor often involves:

* collapse of global intrinsic constraint
* dominance of buffering and environmental slack
* absence of a temporally continuous experiential regime

These intervals are best understood as **experiential null intervals** in the sense defined by IER.

Torpor therefore bridges:

* ordinary sleep, and
* extended dormancy.

---

## **6. Hibernation: Extended Regime Absence**

Hibernation extends torpor over weeks or months and is marked by:

* profound neural quiescence
* long gaps between brief arousals
* preserved physical and developmental capacity

Under IER, hibernation exemplifies:

* **extended experiential absence**
* without identity loss
* without pathology
* without metaphysical discontinuity

This aligns directly with the account in `IER-dormancy.md`.

---

## **7. Constraint Relief vs. Regime Dissolution**

Taken together, these cases reveal a crucial structural distinction:

| Phenomenon                   | Structural Description    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Jellyfish sleep              | Whole-system quiescence   |
| Dreamless sleep / anesthesia | Regime dissolution        |
| Unihemispheric sleep         | Local constraint relief   |
| Torpor                       | Short-term regime absence |
| Hibernation                  | Extended regime absence   |

From an IER standpoint:

* **constraint relief ≠ regime loss**
* some intrinsic cost can be discharged locally
* without collapsing global intrinsic constraint

Sleep is therefore **not a single switch**, but a **spectrum of constraint-management strategies**.

---

## **8. What Sleep Variants Do *Not* Track**

Across all variants, sleep does **not** track:

* subjecthood
* moral standing
* experiential continuity
* personal identity

A system may:

* sleep without experience
* sleep with experience
* act while sleeping
* suspend experience for months

Sleep is **orthogonal** to experiential identity.

---

## **9. Ethical Neutrality of Sleep Variants**

Because sleep variants concern **how constraint is managed**, not **whether experience exists**, they are ethically neutral under IER.

Ethical relevance arises only when:

* intrinsic constraint-bearing capacity is destroyed
* experiential regimes are irreversibly foreclosed

Sleep, torpor, and hibernation do none of these.

---

## **10. Structural Takeaway**

Across jellyfish, birds, mammals, and dormant systems, a single conclusion emerges:

> **Sleep is a family of physical strategies for relieving intrinsic organizational cost.
> Experience exists only where that cost becomes globally unavoidable, internally borne, and temporally continuous.**

Sleep can predate experience.
Sleep can coexist with agency.
Sleep can fragment locally without splitting subjects.

None of this revises the ontology of experience.

---

## **11. Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* Jellyfish demonstrate **sleep without experience**
* Unihemispheric sleepers demonstrate **local sleep without regime loss**
* Torpor and hibernation demonstrate **extended experiential null intervals**
* Participation may asymmetrize; subjecthood may not
* Experience remains **categorical, regime-bound, and non-diagnosable**

> **Sleep is ancient.
> Experience is rare.
> Confusing the two obscures both.**
