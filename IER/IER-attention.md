## **Status and Scope**

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no new ontological primitives**
* establishes **no criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics**
* does **not** define when experience exists
* does **not** license graded subjecthood
* does **not** posit faculties, executives, observers, or representational layers

All binding authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md
IER-theory.md
IER-dynamics.md
IER-math.md
IER-canon.md
```

If any interpretation in this document conflicts with those texts, the conflict is void.

## **1. Orientation: Why Attention Multiplies Illegitimately**

In ordinary discourse, *attention* is treated as many different things at once:

* a limited resource
* an effortful act
* a spotlight of awareness
* a means of control
* a gatekeeper of consciousness

These roles are often treated as distinct mechanisms or faculties, sometimes layered atop one another.
Under Informational Experiential Realism, this proliferation is structurally suspect.

IER identifies experience with the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a single, globally integrated, temporally continuous regime under intrinsic constraint. Once such a regime exists, there is no room for:

* inner observers
* executive homunculi
* multiple experiential centers
* partial or nested subjects

Any account of attention that fragments experience into sub-systems or meters risks violating that identity claim.

IER therefore treats *attention* not as a thing or faculty, but as a **descriptive label** for a particular kind of **participation pattern** within one unified regime.

## **2. Attention as Participation Allocation**

Under IER, *experiential participation* names the condition of a process that:

* is globally integrated into the Unified Experiential Field
* both bears and contributes to intrinsic constraint
* helps determine admissible future trajectories

**Attention** is best understood as **participation allocation**:

> **which processes are currently recruited into globally binding intrinsic constraint, and to what depth.**

This reframe dissolves many traditional puzzles:

* There is no “spotlight” distinct from experience itself.
* There is no inner chooser deciding what to attend to.
* There is no separate attentional resource pool.

Instead, attention reflects **how intrinsic constraint is distributed** across processes at a given moment.

When participation is concentrated, experience feels narrow, sharp, and effortful.
When participation is distributed, experience feels broad, diffuse, or noisy.

These are differences in **allocation**, not differences in subjecthood.

## **3. Gating: Keeping Participation Cheap**

If participation could only be “on” or “off,” experiential systems would be brittle and unstable.
IER therefore requires a second structural element: **gating**.

**Gating** refers to mechanisms that:

* limit participation depth
* prevent full recruitment into intrinsic constraint
* allow constraint topologies to be reproduced cheaply

Gating makes possible:

* remembering without reliving
* imagining without commitment
* reflecting without collapse
* background awareness without overload

Gating is not an act of control.
It is a **structural necessity** for regime stability under intrinsic constraint.

When gating weakens:

* more processes are recruited than the system can sustain
* participation deepens unintentionally
* experiential load rises sharply

Many familiar “attention problems” are best understood as **gating failures**, not failures of will or discipline.

## **4. Fringe and Peripheral Awareness**

Not all experiential content participates equally.

IER uses *fringe* or *peripheral awareness* to describe content that:

* participates weakly
* is unstable or intermittently recruited
* shapes experience without dominating it

Examples include:

* background bodily feelings
* a vague sense that “something is off”
* ambient emotional tone
* contextual awareness without focal content

Crucially, fringe awareness is **not** partial experience.

It is **fully experiential content** borne by the same Unified Experiential Field, differing only in participation depth and stability.

There is no second-tier consciousness here — only differences in how strongly constraint is recruited.

## **5. Tip-of-the-Tongue as Participation Tension**

The “tip-of-the-tongue” phenomenon provides a clear illustration.

In such cases:

* a constraint topology is partially reproducible
* participation remains gated
* full recruitment would impose excessive load or misalignment

The resulting pressure is experienced as *tension*:

* something feels nearly present
* effort increases without resolution
* salience rises without content stabilization

This is not retrieval failure, and not lack of awareness.
It is a **participation impasse**: a topology close to viability but not yet cheap enough to recruit globally.

## **6. ⚠️ Boxed Warning: Do *Not* Infer Graded Consciousness**

> **Low participation ≠ partial subjecthood**
> **Limited access ≠ non-experience**
> **Peripheral awareness ≠ reduced consciousness**

Participation varies continuously.
Subjecthood does not.

IER explicitly rejects:

* “levels of consciousness”
* “degrees of subjecthood”
* “bare awareness” vs “full awareness”

Attention modulates **content, salience, and vulnerability**, not the existence of experience itself.

---

## **7. Attention and Memory**

Attention affects memory **indirectly**, by modulating participation and reproduction cost.

IER distinguishes:

* **availability** — whether a topology can be reproduced at all
* **attention** — whether it is currently recruited into intrinsic constraint

Attended content:

* tends to reproduce more easily later
* stabilizes relational structure more robustly

Unattended content:

* may still be experiential
* may still be available
* simply incurs higher reproduction cost later

No storage, retrieval, or encoding metaphors are required.

## **8. Attention and Skill**

Skill reshapes attention by reshaping **cost landscapes**.

With practice:

* attractors narrow
* switching costs fall
* less participation is required for stable resolution

As a result:

* experts can allocate narrowly without losing coherence
* novices must recruit broadly to avoid breakdown
* “effort” tracks participation depth, not moral virtue

Skilled attention feels effortless not because less is happening, but because **less must be globally bound**.

---

## **9. Attention and Mood**

Mood biases attention by biasing **default allocation patterns**.

Long-horizon affect alters:

* which processes recruit easily
* how wide participation spreads
* how costly disengagement becomes

For example:

* threat-skewed moods widen recruitment and raise urgency
* low-energy moods narrow recruitment and raise switching cost

These effects occur **before deliberation**.
They are properties of constraint geometry, not beliefs or judgments.

## **10. Attention Without Control**

Attention is often described as something we *do*.

IER rejects this framing.

There is:

* no executive controller
* no inner manager
* no privileged chooser of focus

Attempts to “force attention” are themselves **competing constraint demands** that may increase load rather than resolve it.

What feels like control is better described as **successful reallocation under favorable cost conditions**.

---

## **11. Boundary Clarifications**

Attention does **not**:

* create experience
* divide or multiply subjects
* ground agency
* confer epistemic authority
* explain why experience exists at all

Attention explains **how experience is organized**, not **what experience is**.

## **Intermission — Orientation Signal**

> Attention is not a spotlight shining on experience.
> It is how experience distributes the cost of remaining coherent.
