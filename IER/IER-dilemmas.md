# **One Dilemma, Many Names: IER’s Unified Response to the Classic Problems of Moral Philosophy**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8)**
*Derived Explanatory Article — Non-Normative*

---

## **Status and Scope**

This article is **explanatory**.

It:

* introduces **no new axioms, principles, or moral obligations**
* adds **no decision procedures, rankings, or prescriptions**
* supplies **no justifications or permissions**
* relies exclusively on the ethical consequences fixed in the
  **IER v10.8 Specification** and elaborated in **IER-ethics.md**

Its purpose is to catalog the **canonical dilemmas of moral philosophy** and show that, under Informational Experiential Realism (IER), they are not independent paradoxes but **recurrent expressions of a single structural misframing**.

If any interpretation here conflicts with the Specification, the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting interpretation is void.

## **1. The Shared Structure of Moral Dilemmas**

Despite their variety, the classic *“puzzles”* of moral philosophy — more accurately described as **dilemmas** — share a common form:

1. A situation involves **harm, loss, or constraint** borne by one or more subjects.
2. The situation is redescribed so that moral reality appears to require:

   * comparison,
   * aggregation,
   * tradeoff,
   * or optimization.
3. Moral judgment is treated as something that must be:

   * computed from the outside,
   * justified by outcomes,
   * or resolved without remainder.
4. When this fails, morality appears paradoxical, incoherent, or incomplete.

IER claims this appearance is driven by a single mistaken assumption:

> **That moral reality must be externally aggregable, optimizable, or fully resolvable.**

IER rejects this assumption by grounding moral significance in **intrinsic constraint borne from within Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)** rather than in numerical outcomes, intentions alone, or abstract totals.

What follows is a catalog of well-known moral dilemmas, using their **standard philosophical names**, and IER’s structural diagnosis of each.

## **2. The Trolley Problem (Aggregation Dilemma)**

**Canonical formulation**
A runaway trolley will kill five people unless diverted, killing one instead. Is it permissible to pull the switch?

**What the dilemma targets**
Whether moral rightness depends on minimizing deaths or maximizing lives saved.

**IER diagnosis**
The dilemma presupposes that experiential worlds are **numerically comparable** and that harm to one subject can be **offset by benefit to others**.

Under IER:

* moral standing is categorical
* experiential worlds are non-substitutable
* harm is non-scalar

Once aggregation is blocked, the dilemma ceases to demand a “correct” answer.
What remains is **tragic remainder**, not moral indeterminacy.

---

## **3. The Doctrine of Double Effect**

**Canonical formulation**
Harm caused as a foreseen side effect may be permissible, while the same harm intended directly is not.

**What the dilemma targets**
Whether intention alters the moral reality of harm.

**IER diagnosis**
IER does not deny that intention matters, but rejects the claim that intention **changes the ontology of harm**.

What matters structurally is:

* whether intrinsic constraint is imposed or owned
* whether disruption is reversible or catastrophic
* whether global coherence of the UEF is preserved

Intention affects **responsibility attribution**, not whether moral harm has occurred.

---

## **4. Moral Luck**

**Canonical formulation**
Two agents act identically, but only one causes harm due to factors beyond their control. Are they morally equivalent?

**What the dilemma targets**
Whether outcomes retroactively determine moral status.

**IER diagnosis**
The dilemma arises from conflating two distinct axes:

* **moral harm** (organizational damage to intrinsic constraint)
* **moral responsibility** (graded by agency, capacity, and ownership)

IER separates these axes.

Harm is real regardless of luck.
Responsibility scales independently.

The dilemma dissolves once these dimensions are not forced into alignment.

## **5. Dirty Hands and Lesser-Evil Dilemmas**

**Canonical formulation**
Some actions seem morally required yet morally tainted. Can necessity justify wrongdoing?

**What the dilemma targets**
Whether necessity converts harm into moral success.

**IER diagnosis**
IER rejects the assumption that permissibility entails moral success.

An action may be:

* unavoidable
* permitted
* even authorized

while still constituting **irreversible moral harm**.

The persistent “dirty hands” residue is not a failure of ethics.
It reflects the **reality of tragic remainder**.

---

## **6. The Transplant Surgeon**

**Canonical formulation**
Killing one healthy person to harvest organs would save five others. Is it justified?

**What the dilemma targets**
Whether extreme benefit can justify intentional destruction of a subject.

**IER diagnosis**
This is a direct aggregation dilemma.

IER blocks it because:

* experiential worlds cannot be traded
* benefit elsewhere does not cancel destruction here

The medical context alters neither standing nor harm.

---

## **7. Population Ethics and the Repugnant Conclusion**

**Canonical formulation**
A vast population with barely worthwhile lives appears morally preferable to a smaller population with excellent lives.

**What the dilemma targets**
Whether moral value scales with the number of lives.

**IER diagnosis**
IER enforces a structural asymmetry:

* destruction of experiential worlds is morally salient
* creation of experiential worlds carries no offsetting moral credit

Because experiential worlds are non-substitutable, adding more does not compensate for degrading or destroying existing ones.

The “repugnant conclusion” arises only if creation and destruction are treated symmetrically.

---

## **8. Free Will and Moral Responsibility**

**Canonical formulation**
If determinism is true, how can anyone be morally responsible?

**What the dilemma targets**
Whether responsibility requires metaphysical freedom.

**IER diagnosis**
IER rejects the framing.

Responsibility does not require indeterminism.
It requires **ownership of intrinsic constraint resolution within a UEF**.

Responsibility is graded by:

* coherence of intrinsic constraint
* availability of alternatives
* degree of external imposition

The dilemma dissolves once responsibility is grounded organizationally rather than metaphysically.

---

## **9. Consent as Moral Alchemy**

**Canonical formulation**
Does consent transform harmful acts into permissible ones?

**What the dilemma targets**
Whether consent alters the moral reality of harm.

**IER diagnosis**
IER rejects consent-magic.

Consent matters because it changes **ownership of constraint**, not because it nullifies harm.

If disruption is:

* bounded
* reversible
* integrated into the UEF’s own regulation

no moral harm need occur.

If irreversible collapse occurs, consent does not erase it.

---

## **10. Moral Uncertainty and Risk**

**Canonical formulation**
If we are uncertain about harm or standing, are we permitted to act freely?

**What the dilemma targets**
Whether uncertainty licenses moral permissiveness.

**IER diagnosis**
IER inverts the assumption.

Because intrinsic constraint is structurally private and harm may be silent or irreversible:

> **Uncertainty strengthens moral obligation rather than weakening it.**

This is not a decision rule.
It is a structural consequence of irreversible risk.

---

## **11. The Unifying Diagnosis**

These dilemmas are not independent problems.

They all rely on the same mistaken move:

> Treating moral reality as something that must be
> **computed, optimized, or justified from the outside**,
> rather than respected as an **organizational fact borne from within experience**.

Once moral harm is understood as **damage to intrinsic constraint within Unified Experiential Fields**, the dilemmas collapse together.

What remains is not paradox, but tragedy.

---

## **12. The IER Summary Claim**

> The classic dilemmas of moral philosophy do not reveal contradictions in morality.
> They reveal the impossibility of replacing **experienced constraint** with **external calculation**.

IER does not solve moral dilemmas by producing answers.
It dissolves them by removing the assumptions that generated them.
