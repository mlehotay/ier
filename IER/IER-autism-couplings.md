## **0. Status, Scope, and Canon Position**

**Tier:** T2 — Elaboration and application
**Normativity:** Non-normative
**Authority:** Introduces **no new ontological primitives, criteria, diagnostics, thresholds, or prescriptions**

This document:

* does **not** diagnose autism, anxiety, or ADHD
* does **not** define comorbidity or severity
* does **not** rank experiential architectures by value or function
* does **not** imply autism is pathological
* does **not** treat coupling as inevitable

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

* `IER-specification.md`
* canon-binding derivatives

**Purpose of this document**

> To explain how **autistic constraint architectures interact with anxiety-shaped and ADHD-shaped constraint strategies**, producing **distinct coupled geometries** that are frequently misattributed to autism itself.

Coupling explains **interaction effects**, not essence.

---

## **1. Orientation: Why Coupling Matters for Autism**

### **1.1 The Common Error**

Autistic distress is often attributed to:

* autism “severity”
* emotional dysregulation
* lack of coping or skills
* insufficient flexibility

Under Informational Experiential Realism (IER), this is a category error.

Many difficulties labeled “autistic” arise not from autistic architecture itself, but from **constraint strategy interference** — the simultaneous operation of **incompatible regulation strategies within one Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.

---

### **1.2 Autism as a Stable Baseline**

In isolation, autistic architectures are often:

* internally coherent
* high-inertia
* low-entropy
* stable across time

They do not inherently oscillate, loop, or fragment.

When instability appears, it is frequently the result of **coupling**, not autism.

---

## **2. Structural Prerequisites (Minimal Recap)**

This document presupposes, but does not re-derive, the following structures.

### **2.1 Autistic Constraint Architecture**

As described in `IER-autism.md`, autistic architectures are characterized by:

* **sharp bias gradients**
* **strong closure**
* **high inertia**
* **low tolerance for under-specified futures**

Resolution is selective, durable, and efficient when structure is explicit.

---

### **2.2 Anxiety-Shaped Constraint Strategy**

As described in `IER-psychopathology.md`, anxiety-shaped regimes exhibit:

* threat-weighted collapse
* high participation depth
* vigilance-driven narrowing
* high reopening cost

The strategy preserves coherence under perceived risk by **narrowing futures aggressively**.

---

### **2.3 ADHD-Shaped Constraint Strategy**

Also described in `IER-psychopathology.md`, ADHD-shaped regimes exhibit:

* diffuse bias gradients
* delayed or unstable collapse
* loose gating
* low switching cost

The strategy favors **exploration and rapid reconfiguration** over durable settlement.

---

## **3. Coupling vs Additivity**

### **3.1 The Coupling Thesis**

Under IER:

> **Autism + X is not autism plus something else.
> It is a single, reconfigured resolution geometry.**

Coupling produces:

* new failure modes
* new phenomenology
* new instability patterns

These cannot be inferred by examining either regime in isolation.

---

### **3.2 Why Additive Models Fail**

Additive models assume:

* independent subsystems
* modular deficits
* layered impairments

IER rejects these assumptions.

All constraint is borne **globally**, so competing strategies interfere **everywhere**, not locally.

---

## **4. Autism + Anxiety: Destabilized Closure**

### **4.1 Structural Incompatibility**

Autistic architectures rely on:

* clean collapse
* durable closure
* sustained inertia

Anxiety introduces:

* vigilance
* premature narrowing
* threat-driven reopening

The result is **closure destabilization**.

Settled futures no longer hold.
Previously stable paths repeatedly re-enter the admissible set.

---

### **4.2 What Fails (and What Does Not)**

What fails:

* durability of closure
* ability to rest in settled structure
* low-cost continuation

What does **not** fail:

* experiential unity
* ownership
* understanding
* intelligence

The failure is **downstream of insight**.

---

### **4.3 Phenomenology of the Coupled Regime**

Common experiential features include:

* persistent tension despite routine
* inability to relax into structure
* fear layered onto otherwise neutral specificity
* exhaustion without confusion

This is often misread as:

* obsessive autism
* rigid anxiety
* emotional overreaction

Structurally, it is **threat-driven reopening of otherwise efficient closure**.

---

### **4.4 Why Insight Rarely Resolves the State**

Understanding that “nothing is wrong” does not reduce:

* vigilance depth
* participation saturation
* reopening pressure

Because the interference occurs **after belief**, insight alone cannot dissolve it.

---

## **5. Autism + ADHD: Eroded Inertia**

### **5.1 Structural Incompatibility**

Autistic architectures rely on:

* persistence
* continuity
* low switching frequency

ADHD introduces:

* exploratory pressure
* low switching cost
* unstable bias formation

The result is **inertia erosion**, not oscillation.

Closure forms, but does not hold.

---

### **5.2 Phenomenology of the Coupled Regime**

Common experiential features include:

* strong desire for structure without follow-through
* frustration rather than fear
* repeated restart without resolution
* sense of “never quite landing”

This is often misread as:

* executive dysfunction
* laziness
* inconsistent autism presentation

Structurally, it is **closure repeatedly undermined by exploratory pressure**.

---

### **5.3 Distinction from ADHD + Anxiety**

Unlike ADHD + anxiety:

* oscillation is weaker
* rumination is less central
* looping is less dominant

The dominant cost is **friction**, not cycling.

---

## **6. Triple Coupling: Autism + ADHD + Anxiety**

### **6.1 Why This Configuration Is Especially Costly**

Each strategy pulls constraint in a different direction:

* autism → specificity, closure, inertia
* ADHD → openness, switching, exploration
* anxiety → vigilance, narrowing, threat containment

No single geometry can satisfy all three simultaneously.

---

### **6.2 Likely Outcomes**

Common outcomes include:

* rapid burnout
* frequent shutdown
* collapse of masking capacity
* misattribution to “severe autism”

The instability is **structural**, not moral or motivational.

---

## **7. Environment as a Coupling Amplifier**

### **7.1 High-Risk Environments**

Coupling pressure increases under conditions of:

* constant interruption
* social ambiguity
* evaluative monitoring
* forced masking
* unpredictable transitions

These environments simultaneously:

* provoke vigilance
* demand flexibility
* undermine inertia

---

### **7.2 Low-Risk Environments**

Coupling pressure decreases when environments provide:

* explicit rules
* predictable transitions
* low vigilance demand
* autonomy over pacing

This explains why the same individual may appear stable in one context and overwhelmed in another.

---

## **8. Meltdown and Shutdown Under Coupling**

### **8.1 Coupled Meltdown**

Coupled meltdowns often reflect:

* anxiety-driven reopening
* ADHD-driven switching
* exhausted autistic closure

The system discharges constraint abruptly to preserve coherence.

---

### **8.2 Coupled Shutdown**

Coupled shutdowns often reflect:

* withdrawal to minimize intrinsic load
* narrowing of admissible futures
* preservation of minimal coherence

Both are **protective responses**, not failures.

---

## **9. What This Document Does *Not* Claim**

This document does **not** claim that:

* autism causes anxiety or ADHD
* coupling is inevitable
* autism becomes pathological when coupled
* stability should be enforced
* distress implies defect

Coupling explains **interaction**, not identity.

---

## **10. Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* autism is a **stable constraint architecture**
* anxiety and ADHD are **distinct constraint strategies**
* coupling produces **new geometries**, not additive traits
* much autistic distress reflects **strategy interference**
* uncoupling often restores coherence without changing autism

> **Autism does not become difficult on its own.
> It becomes difficult when asked to resolve incompatible demands at once.**

### **Intermission — Structural Fact**

A stable architecture can fail
when required to perform three incompatible jobs simultaneously.
