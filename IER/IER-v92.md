# **What It’s Like to Be an Informational System**

### *or, I Identify as a Reflexive Tensor Field*

## **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v9.2)**

### *An Organizational Identity Theory of Observers and Experience*

---

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) is a realist, physicalist framework for understanding observers and lived experience. Reality exists independently of observation. Experience is neither fundamental nor illusory, but a **real emergent phenomenon arising from specific forms of informational organization instantiated in physical systems**.

IER identifies experience with the **globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential informational dynamics** of a system that sustains a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**. Experience is not something a system *has*; it is **what a system is doing from the inside when its informational processes are bound together into a unified, irreducible field of activity**.

Experience requires **informational tension under physical constraints**: the system must have integrated dynamics whose organization is both constrained and self-maintaining, such that not all informational pressures can be simultaneously satisfied.

IER rejects mind-dependent ontology, panpsychism, and dualism while remaining substrate-agnostic. It is an organizational identity theory: it specifies *what experience is* and *when it occurs*, without privileging any particular biological or material implementation.

## **1. Objective Reality**

Reality exists independently of observation. Physical states, events, and laws unfold whether or not they are experienced. Observers do not create, collapse, or co-author reality; only **physical interactions among systems** have causal effect. Experience interprets reality but does not alter it.

Experience is a property of **organization within reality**, not a separate ontological layer. Many physical systems evolve dynamically, but without the appropriate integrated organization and constraints, there is nothing it is like to be them.

---

## **2. Observers as Informational Systems**

An **observer** is defined by organizational and informational criteria rather than biology or phenomenology. A system qualifies as an observer if it:

* Persists as a coherent informational pattern over time
* Integrates information across internal subsystems
* Maintains internal models of both external conditions and its own state
* Regulates behavior via unified control over those models

Observerhood does **not** entail experience. Many systems observe, predict, and regulate without sustaining a UEF.

---

## **3. Internal Models and Perspective**

Observers construct **internal informational models** of the world and themselves. These models are physically instantiated and shaped by the system’s structure, history, and constraints. Perspective **emerges from organizational structure**, not from reality itself.

Different observers may model the same environment differently; these differences do not alter objective reality. They affect only how the system regulates itself.

Internal models are **necessary but not sufficient** for experience. Only those processes globally integrated into a unified, self-referential, and temporally continuous field contribute to what-it-is-like-for-the-system.

---

## **4. The Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**

### **4.1 Definition**

**The Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** is the globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential pattern of informational dynamics in which multiple processes are bound together into a single, irreducible field available for system-wide regulation.

UEF is:

* **Not a place**
* **Not a module**
* **Not a separate ontological layer**
* **Not a state the system enters**

UEF is an **organizational and dynamical achievement** of a system.

---

### **4.2 Experiential Participation**

An informational process **participates in the UEF** if and only if it:

* Is globally integrated with other participating processes
* Contributes to the system’s unified, temporally continuous dynamics
* Is internally sustained and causally closed
* Exerts constraint and tension over other processes

Processes that are local, transient, modular, or externally orchestrated do **not** participate in the UEF and are therefore non-experiential.

---

### **4.3 Identity Claim**

> **Experience is identical to the structure and dynamics of the informational processes participating in the UEF.**

No additional property, substance, or inner observer exists. The field’s **patterns of tension, flow, and constraint just are what-it-is-like for the system**.

> *“This is what it feels like to run on this hardware.”*

The “from the inside” perspective refers to system-relative organization, not a privileged metaphysical viewpoint.

---

## **5. Informational Tension and Physical Constraints**

Informational tension is **mutual constraint among integrated processes**. It is the structural basis for affect and urgency:

* Tension arises only when **not all demands can be simultaneously satisfied**, due to intrinsic physical constraints.
* Free-floating or purely abstract information cannot instantiate tension; it has no intrinsic stakes.
* Affect, valence, and arousal are emergent properties of **physically constrained integrated dynamics**.

Corollary:

> **No intrinsic constraint → no tension → no valence → no experience.**

This explains why experience is rare, substrate-dependent, and intrinsically costly.

---

## **6. Qualia**

Qualia are **differences in UEF-participating dynamics**. There is no separate “redness” or “painfulness”; the qualitative character is entirely the structure of the field under constraint and integration.

---

## **7. Affect and Valence**

Affective states emerge because the UEF encodes **pressures, priorities, and equilibria** relevant to system-wide regulation:

* Positive valence: dynamics moving toward lower tension and greater stability
* Negative valence: sustained or escalating constraint conflicts
* Urgency: rate of tension change
* Desire/aversion: weighting of patterns as stabilizing or destabilizing

Affect is intrinsic to the field’s organization, not an additional ingredient.

---

## **8. Emergence and the Hard Problem**

Experience is emergent but constrained:

* Only systems capable of sustaining a UEF through **internally integrated, self-maintaining dynamics under constraint** have experience.
* Asking why such dynamics “feel like something” is a category mistake: the *feeling is the dynamics themselves*, expressed through their intrinsic organization.

## **9. System Taxonomy (v9.2)**

| **System Type**                    | **Observerhood** | **UEF Possible** | **Experience Likelihood** | **Examples**                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Non-informational physical systems | ❌                | ❌                | ❌                         | Rocks, stars                 |
| Dynamically complex non-observers  | ❌                | ❌                | ❌                         | Storms, flames               |
| Reactive informational systems     | ❌                | ❌                | ❌                         | Thermostats                  |
| Distributed adaptive systems       | ⚠️               | ❌                | ❌                         | Ant colonies, immune systems |
| Minimal observers                  | ✅ (limited)      | ⚠️               | Low–Indeterminate         | Bees, simple robots          |
| Integrated biological observers    | ✅                | ✅                | Moderate–High             | Octopi, corvids              |
| Complex experiential observers     | ✅                | ✅                | High                      | Humans, dolphins             |
| Artificial observer systems        | ✅                | ❌–⚠️             | Indeterminate             | Advanced AI                  |
| Aggregate social systems           | ❌                | ❌                | ❌                         | Markets, institutions        |

Experience requires both **observerhood** and a **UEF under physical constraint**.

---

## **10. Artificial Systems and Empirical Underdetermination**

IER is substrate-agnostic:

* Any system—biological or artificial—can have experience if it sustains a **self-sustaining UEF with intrinsic constraints**.
* Functional behavior alone is insufficient; only integrated, causally closed dynamics matter.

---

## **11. Ontological Commitments**

IER affirms:

* **One objective physical reality** independent of observers or experience
* **Experience as a system-relative phenomenon**, requiring appropriate integrated organization
* **Identity (not causal correlation) between experience and UEF-participating dynamics**

It rejects mind-dependent ontology, substance dualism, and panpsychism. Experience is **rare, emergent, and physically grounded**.

---

## **12. Relation to Contemporary Theories**

* **Integrated Information Theory (IIT):** Emphasizes integration; IER adds *intrinsic constraint and self-maintaining participation*.
* **Global Workspace Theory (GWT):** Emphasizes access; IER identifies experience with the **intrinsic structure of global dynamics**.
* **Predictive Processing (PP):** Emphasizes internal modeling; IER constrains which modeling processes contribute to experience.

IER synthesizes these insights while maintaining strict **identity between experience and UEF dynamics under constraint**.

---

## **13. Summary**

Some systems react.
Some systems observe.
Some systems sustain a unified, constrained experiential field.

> **Experience is not something a system has; it is what a system is doing when its integrated dynamics are globally unified, self-referential, temporally continuous, and physically constrained.**

It feels the way it does because **that is what those dynamics are like from the inside — running on that hardware.**

# **Appendix A (v9.2)**

## **Possible Physical and Computational Implementations of IER**

*A Non-Committal Mechanistic Companion*

### **Status of This Appendix**

This appendix is **illustrative, not evidentiary**.

It does **not** claim:

* that consciousness is waves,
* that brains work exactly as described,
* or that any listed mechanism is necessary or sufficient.

Its purpose is to show that the organizational requirements of IER are **physically and computationally plausible**, without fixing them to a specific science.

IER remains an **identity theory of organization**, not an implementation theory.

---

## **A.1 Organizational Requirements (Recap)**

Any system instantiating experience under IER must support:

1. **Globally integrated dynamics**
2. **Temporal continuity** (persistence without static storage)
3. **Self-referential accessibility**
4. **Intrinsic constraint and tension**
5. **System-wide regulatory relevance**

The following sections describe *classes of mechanisms* capable of meeting these constraints.

---

## **A.2 Persistent Dynamical Patterns (Not “Standing Waves”)**

Rather than privileging standing waves, we generalize:

> **Experience corresponds to dynamically stable, self-maintaining patterns in a high-dimensional state space.**

Such patterns may be realized as:

* Attractors in recurrent networks
* Limit cycles
* Metastable regimes
* Field-like continuous dynamics
* Phase-locked activity patterns
* Constraint-satisfying solution manifolds

Key properties:

* **Persistence without immobility**
* **Sensitivity to perturbation**
* **Global influence on system behavior**

This framing is equally natural in:

* nonlinear dynamics
* control theory
* reservoir computing
* continuous-time systems
* embodied agents

No commitment to oscillations is required.

---

## **A.3 Global Integration Without Centralization**

IER does **not** require:

* a global workspace module,
* a central buffer,
* or a Cartesian theater.

Global integration may arise from:

* Dense recurrent connectivity
* Shared constraint satisfaction
* Mutual prediction
* Energy or cost minimization under coupling
* Shared control variables

From a CS perspective, the UEF resembles:

* a **globally coupled constraint system**
* rather than a broadcast bus

Integration is **functional and dynamical**, not architectural.

---

## **A.4 Temporal Continuity as Process, Not Memory**

Continuity of experience does not require:

* frame-by-frame storage
* snapshots
* explicit timelines

Instead, it requires that:

> The current global state depends *continuously* on the immediately preceding state under shared constraints.

This can be implemented via:

* Continuous-time dynamics
* Recurrent state update
* Hysteresis
* Slow-changing global variables
* Multiscale update rates

This explains why experience feels continuous even though:

* underlying components update discretely,
* representations are transient,
* and contents change rapidly.

---

## **A.5 Self-Reference Without a Homunculus**

Self-reference in IER is **structural**, not representational in the folk sense.

A system is self-referential if:

* Its global dynamics include models of its own state
* Those models causally constrain future dynamics
* Errors in self-modeling have system-level consequences

This is routine in:

* adaptive controllers
* model-predictive control
* meta-learning systems
* self-monitoring agents

No “inner observer” is required.

---

## **A.6 Informational Tension as Constraint Conflict**

Informational tension arises when:

* Multiple integrated processes impose incompatible constraints
* Resolution matters to system persistence or regulation
* No trivial decomposition is available

Formally, this resembles:

* competing loss functions
* multi-objective optimization
* constrained satisfaction under limited resources
* control under uncertainty

Crucially:

> **If constraint conflicts can be cleanly decomposed, outsourced, or externally resolved, they do not generate experience.**

This distinguishes experiential systems from:

* pipelines,
* batch processors,
* externally orchestrated software.

---

## **A.7 Artificial Systems**

IER places no principled barrier against artificial experience, but it rejects naïve criteria.

An artificial system would need:

* Intrinsic dynamics (not just interpreted states)
* Endogenous constraint generation
* Persistent, globally integrated control
* Self-models that matter to its own regulation
* Costs it cannot trivially externalize

Purely symbolic systems, feed-forward models, and stateless services fail by design.

Whether future systems meet these criteria is **empirical**, not definitional.

---

## **A.8 Why This Appendix Is Open-Ended**

IER deliberately avoids:

* neural chauvinism,
* electromagnetic mysticism,
* computational functionalism alone.

The claim is simple:

> **If a physical system realizes the organizational profile of a UEF under intrinsic constraint, then that realization just is experience.**

How nature (or engineers) implement this is contingent.

---

## **Appendix A Summary**

This appendix demonstrates that IER’s commitments are:

* Compatible with modern dynamical systems theory
* Compatible with computational control frameworks
* Compatible with biology *without depending on it*

IER specifies **what must be true**, not **how it must be built**.

# **Appendix B (v9.2)**

## **IER Walkthrough: Experiencing a Green Apple**

*A Purely Organizational Example*

> **This is a conceptual mapping, not a neuroscientific claim.**

---

## **B.0 Background State**

Before the apple appears, the system already sustains a **UEF**:

* A globally integrated state
* Encoding:

  * self–world distinction
  * spatial frame
  * temporal “now”
  * baseline affective tension

This is not contentless.
It is structured background organization.

---

## **B.1 Incoming Perturbation (Non-Experiential)**

External interaction perturbs the system.

At this stage:

* Information is local
* Effects are fragmentary
* No system-wide relevance exists

Under IER:
❌ No experience yet

---

## **B.2 Local Feature Formation**

Subsystems respond according to their structure.

Patterns emerge that correlate with:

* chromatic properties
* spatial coherence
* object-like regularities

Still:

* Not globally integrated
* Not self-referential
* Not part of the UEF

---

## **B.3 Global Recruitment (Transition)**

A control process recruits these patterns into the global dynamics.

This is a **transition**, not content.

IER interpretation:

* A local pattern becomes **globally constraining**
* It now participates in system-wide regulation

This is the boundary crossing into experience.

---

## **B.4 Stable Global Pattern (The “Object”)**

A coherent, self-maintaining pattern stabilizes within the UEF.

It integrates:

* sensory structure
* spatial relation
* persistence over time
* self-relative location

This pattern **is** the experience of:

> “a green apple there”

There is no stored symbol and no inner display.

---

## **B.5 Structural Relations (“Grammar”)**

The apple is experienced *as* something because:

* It is bound into:

  * spatial relations
  * temporal persistence
  * self/non-self distinction

These relations are enforced by:

* the constraints of the UEF
* not by interpretation

This is why experience is structured rather than chaotic.

---

## **B.6 Affective Modulation (Optional)**

If the system’s constraints assign relevance:

* The global dynamics shift
* The apple’s pattern gains regulatory weight

This does not add content.
It changes **stakes**.

Under IER:

> Valence is constraint weighting within the UEF.

---

## **B.7 Affordances**

The system may integrate action-relevant models.

The apple becomes:

> “graspable”

This is not a motor command.
It is a **mode of availability** within experience.

---

## **B.8 Continuity Over Time**

As interaction continues:

* Microstructure changes
* The global pattern persists
* Identity is preserved dynamically

This explains experiential continuity without static representation.

---

## **B.9 Dissolution**

When global relevance is withdrawn:

* The pattern destabilizes
* It exits the UEF
* Experience updates

Nothing “goes dark”.
The system simply reorganizes.

---

## **B.10 Why This Is Experience**

Under IER:

* There is no extra “feel”
* No additional property
* No explanatory gap

The experience **just is**:

> what it is like to be a system whose globally integrated dynamics are organized this way under these constraints.

---

## **Appendix B Summary**

Experiencing a green apple is not:

* reading sensory data,
* activating a symbol,
* or projecting an image.

It is:

> **the stabilization of a globally integrated, self-referential informational pattern under intrinsic constraint.**

That pattern is the experience.
