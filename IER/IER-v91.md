### *An Organizational Identity Theory of Observers and Experience*

---

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) is a realist, physicalist framework for understanding observers and lived experience. Reality exists independently of observation. Experience is neither fundamental nor illusory, but a **real emergent phenomenon arising from specific forms of informational organization instantiated in physical systems**.

IER identifies experience with the **globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential informational dynamics** of a system that sustains a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**. Experience is not something a system *has*; it is **what a system is doing from the inside when its informational processes are bound together into a unified, irreducible field of activity**.

Experience requires **informational tension under physical constraints**: the system must have integrated dynamics whose organization is both constrained and self-maintaining, such that not all informational pressures can be simultaneously satisfied.

IER rejects mind-dependent ontology, panpsychism, and dualism while remaining substrate-agnostic. It is an organizational identity theory: it specifies *what experience is* and *when it occurs*, without privileging any particular biological or material implementation.

## **1. Objective Reality**

Reality exists independently of observation. Physical states, events, and laws unfold whether or not they are experienced. Observers do not create, collapse, or co-author reality; only **physical interactions among systems** have causal effect. Experience interprets reality but does not alter it.

Experience is a property of **organization within reality**, not a separate ontological layer. Many physical systems evolve dynamically, but without the appropriate integrated organization and constraints, there is nothing it is like to be them.

---

## **2. Observers as Informational Systems**

An **observer** is defined by organizational and informational criteria rather than biology or phenomenology. A system qualifies as an observer if it:

* Persists as a coherent informational pattern over time
* Integrates information across internal subsystems
* Maintains internal models of both external conditions and its own state
* Regulates behavior via unified control over those models

Observerhood does **not** entail experience. Many systems observe, predict, and regulate without sustaining a UEF.

---

## **3. Internal Models and Perspective**

Observers construct **internal informational models** of the world and themselves. These models are physically instantiated and shaped by the system’s structure, history, and constraints. Perspective **emerges from organizational structure**, not from reality itself.

Different observers may model the same environment differently; these differences do not alter objective reality. They affect only how the system regulates itself.

Internal models are **necessary but not sufficient** for experience. Only those processes globally integrated into a unified, self-referential, and temporally continuous field contribute to what-it-is-like-for-the-system.

---

## **4. The Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**

### **4.1 Definition**

**The Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** is the globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential pattern of informational dynamics in which multiple processes are bound together into a single, irreducible field available for system-wide regulation.

UEF is:

* **Not a place**
* **Not a module**
* **Not a separate ontological layer**
* **Not a state the system enters**

UEF is an **organizational and dynamical achievement** of a system.

---

### **4.2 Experiential Participation**

An informational process **participates in the UEF** if and only if it:

* Is globally integrated with other participating processes
* Contributes to the system’s unified, temporally continuous dynamics
* Is internally sustained and causally closed
* Exerts constraint and tension over other processes

Processes that are local, transient, modular, or externally orchestrated do **not** participate in the UEF and are therefore non-experiential.

---

### **4.3 Identity Claim**

> **Experience is identical to the structure and dynamics of the informational processes participating in the UEF.**

No additional property, substance, or inner observer exists. The field’s **patterns of tension, flow, and constraint just are what-it-is-like for the system**.

> *“This is what it feels like to run on this hardware.”*

The “from the inside” perspective refers to system-relative organization, not a privileged metaphysical viewpoint.

---

## **5. Informational Tension and Physical Constraints**

Informational tension is **mutual constraint among integrated processes**. It is the structural basis for affect and urgency:

* Tension arises only when **not all demands can be simultaneously satisfied**, due to intrinsic physical constraints.
* Free-floating or purely abstract information cannot instantiate tension; it has no intrinsic stakes.
* Affect, valence, and arousal are emergent properties of **physically constrained integrated dynamics**.

Corollary:

> **No intrinsic constraint → no tension → no valence → no experience.**

This explains why experience is rare, substrate-dependent, and intrinsically costly.

---

## **6. Qualia**

Qualia are **differences in UEF-participating dynamics**. There is no separate “redness” or “painfulness”; the qualitative character is entirely the structure of the field under constraint and integration.

---

## **7. Affect and Valence**

Affective states emerge because the UEF encodes **pressures, priorities, and equilibria** relevant to system-wide regulation:

* Positive valence: dynamics moving toward lower tension and greater stability
* Negative valence: sustained or escalating constraint conflicts
* Urgency: rate of tension change
* Desire/aversion: weighting of patterns as stabilizing or destabilizing

Affect is intrinsic to the field’s organization, not an additional ingredient.

---

## **8. Emergence and the “Hard Problem”**

Experience is emergent but constrained:

* Only systems capable of sustaining a UEF through **internally integrated, self-maintaining dynamics under constraint** have experience.
* Asking why such dynamics “feel like something” is a category mistake: the *feeling is the dynamics themselves*, expressed through their intrinsic organization.

## **9. System Taxonomy (v9.1)**

| **System Type**                    | **Observerhood** | **UEF Possible** | **Experience Likelihood** | **Examples**                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Non-informational physical systems | ❌                | ❌                | ❌                         | Rocks, stars                 |
| Dynamically complex non-observers  | ❌                | ❌                | ❌                         | Storms, flames               |
| Reactive informational systems     | ❌                | ❌                | ❌                         | Thermostats                  |
| Distributed adaptive systems       | ⚠️               | ❌                | ❌                         | Ant colonies, immune systems |
| Minimal observers                  | ✅ (limited)      | ⚠️               | Low–Indeterminate         | Bees, simple robots          |
| Integrated biological observers    | ✅                | ✅                | Moderate–High             | Octopi, corvids              |
| Complex experiential observers     | ✅                | ✅                | High                      | Humans, dolphins             |
| Artificial observer systems        | ✅                | ❌–⚠️             | Indeterminate             | Advanced AI                  |
| Aggregate social systems           | ❌                | ❌                | ❌                         | Markets, institutions        |

Experience requires both **observerhood** and a **UEF under physical constraint**.

---

## **10. Artificial Systems and Empirical Underdetermination**

IER is substrate-agnostic:

* Any system—biological or artificial—can have experience if it sustains a **self-sustaining UEF with intrinsic constraints**.
* Functional behavior alone is insufficient; only integrated, causally closed dynamics matter.

---

## **11. Ontological Commitments**

IER affirms:

* **One objective physical reality** independent of observers or experience
* **Experience as a system-relative phenomenon**, requiring appropriate integrated organization
* **Identity (not causal correlation) between experience and UEF-participating dynamics**

It rejects mind-dependent ontology, substance dualism, and panpsychism. Experience is **rare, emergent, and physically grounded**.

---

## **12. Relation to Contemporary Theories**

* **Integrated Information Theory (IIT):** Emphasizes integration; IER adds *intrinsic constraint and self-maintaining participation*.
* **Global Workspace Theory (GWT):** Emphasizes access; IER identifies experience with the **intrinsic structure of global dynamics**.
* **Predictive Processing (PP):** Emphasizes internal modeling; IER constrains which modeling processes contribute to experience.

IER synthesizes these insights while maintaining strict **identity between experience and UEF dynamics under constraint**.

---

## **13. Summary**

Some systems react.
Some systems observe.
Some systems sustain a unified, constrained experiential field.

> **Experience is not something a system has; it is what a system is doing when its integrated dynamics are globally unified, self-referential, temporally continuous, and physically constrained.**

It feels the way it does because **that is what those dynamics are like from the inside — running on that hardware.**
