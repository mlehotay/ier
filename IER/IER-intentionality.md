## Intentionality in Informational Experiential Realism (IER)

### Aboutness, Reference, and Constraint-Stabilized Organization

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.x)**
*Boundary & Clarification Document — Non-Normative*

---

## Status and Scope

This document is a **non-normative boundary and clarification document** derived from the
**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.x) Normative Specification** (“the Specification”).

It:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* adds **no representational or semantic ontology**
* proposes **no theory of truth conditions**
* asserts **no diagnostics or detection criteria**
* does **not amend or extend** the Specification

All ontological, definitional, and ethical commitments are fixed **exclusively** by:

→ **IER-specification.md**

The purpose of this document is to state **clearly and positively** how IER accounts for phenomena traditionally grouped under *intentionality*—including aboutness, reference, and intentional content—**without** importing representationalism, semantic realism, or phenomenological authority.

## Abstract

Intentionality is traditionally treated as the mind’s capacity to be *about* the world: to refer, represent, or carry content with truth conditions. Informational Experiential Realism (IER) rejects this framing.

Under IER, intentionality is **not** a primitive relation between mental states and external objects, nor a semantic property borne by representations. What philosophers call intentionality is instead an **organizational fact** about experience: the existence of **constraint-stabilized patterns** within a Unified Experiential Field (UEF) whose persistence depends on, and is shaped by, the structure of the world.

This document explains intentionality as a **derived feature of intrinsically constrained dynamics**, not as a semantic bridge between mind and reality. Once experience is identified with globally integrated dynamics under intrinsic constraint, intentionality no longer poses a distinct metaphysical problem.

## 1. Why Intentionality Becomes a Problem Elsewhere

Classical accounts characterize intentionality in terms such as:

* mental states are *about* things
* thoughts *refer* to objects or states of affairs
* beliefs have *content* that can be true or false

These characterizations generate persistent questions:

* How does physical matter acquire semantic reference?
* How can internal states point to external objects?
* How is misrepresentation possible?
* How is intentionality related to consciousness?

Most frameworks respond by positing:

* internal representations
* semantic mappings
* content-bearing states
* truth-conditional structure

IER does not accept this starting point.
The problem of intentionality, as traditionally posed, is a consequence of treating **semantics as fundamental**.

---

## 2. The IER Starting Point: Experience as Constraint-Bearing Dynamics

IER’s core identity claim is:

> **Experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a Unified Experiential Field (UEF).**

A UEF is a globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-regulating dynamical regime operating under **coherent intrinsic constraint**.

From this starting point, nothing further is required to explain experience.
In particular, nothing in the identity claim requires:

* representations
* symbols
* semantic reference
* intentional objects

IER therefore does **not** ask how intentionality arises *in addition to* experience.
It asks instead: **what organizational features of experience give rise to the appearance of aboutness?**

---

## 3. Constraint-Stabilized Attractors

Within a Unified Experiential Field, not all patterns are equivalent.

Some patterns:

* recur reliably across time
* resist perturbation
* structure system-wide regulation
* modulate intrinsic constraint
* bias future trajectories

These patterns function as **constraint-stabilized attractors**.

A constraint-stabilized attractor is:

* not a representation
* not a symbol
* not a semantic entity

It is an **organizationally stable pattern** whose persistence matters because it participates in the system’s intrinsic constraint. Its stability is not accidental; it is maintained because losing it would increase global constraint cost.

These attractors are the structural basis of intentional phenomena.

---

## 4. Aboutness as Constraint Relevance

Under IER, a state is *about* something **iff**:

* a stabilized pattern within the UEF
* remains stable *because* of regularities in the environment
* and *because* that stability matters for intrinsic constraint regulation

Aboutness is therefore not a semantic relation.
It is a fact about **why a pattern persists**.

The system does not internally point to an object.
Rather, certain experiential patterns endure **because the world has the structure it does**, and because that structure constrains the system from the inside.

Aboutness is constraint relevance made visible from within experience.

---

## 5. Reference as Constraint-Sensitive Coupling

Traditional theories treat reference as a relation between symbols and objects.
IER rejects symbols as foundational.

Under IER, reference consists in:

> **Reliable coupling between stabilized experiential patterns and external structure such that disruption of that structure destabilizes the pattern.**

A pattern “refers” to X only in this limited, physical sense:

* its stability depends on X-like structure
* perturbations to X alter or dissolve the pattern
* maintaining the pattern contributes to managing intrinsic constraint

There is no further semantic fact.
Reference is **organizational dependence**, not symbolic designation.

---

## 6. Intentional Content as Organizational Role

IER denies that mental states *contain* content.

What is called intentional content corresponds to:

* the **role** a stabilized pattern plays
* within the UEF’s global constraint landscape
* across time and counterfactual trajectories

Two systems may behave identically yet differ experientially because:

* their intrinsic constraints differ
* their stabilization pressures differ
* the same pattern occupies a different constraint-regulating role

Intentional “content” is therefore:

* system-relative
* non-portable
* not context-free

It names an organizational function, not an internal item.

---

## 7. Error Without Misrepresentation

Representational theories struggle to explain misrepresentation.

IER does not.

A stabilized pattern may:

* persist despite environmental mismatch
* remain stable under false assumptions
* fail to track relevant structure

This is not semantic error.
It is **constraint misalignment**.

What is traditionally called misrepresentation is, under IER, a case where stabilization pressures no longer align with the environmental structures that originally supported them.

Error is organizational, not semantic.

---

## 8. Intentionality Depends on Experience

IER does not treat intentionality as a precondition for experience.

The dependence runs the other way.

* **Experience exists iff a UEF exists**
* Intentional phenomena arise *within* experience
* They require intrinsic constraint and global integration

There is therefore:

* no unconscious intentionality with full semantic content
* no purely computational aboutness
* no free-floating intentional states

Intentionality exists only where experience exists, and only as a derivative organizational description.

---

## 9. Explicit Rejections

IER explicitly rejects the claims that:

* experience is fundamentally representational
* intentionality is a basic metaphysical relation
* mental states encode propositions
* reference requires truth conditions
* semantics is required for cognition
* meaning is intrinsic to symbols

Intentionality does not require a separate philosophical “solution.”

---

## 10. Why the Traditional Problem Dissolves

The classical intentionality problem arises only if one assumes:

1. internal states must refer
2. reference must be semantic
3. semantics must be naturalized

IER rejects the first assumption.

Once experience is identified with constraint-bearing dynamics, intentionality reduces to:

* stabilization
* coupling
* relevance
* organizational role

Nothing remains to be explained at the metaphysical level.

## 11. Summary

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

> **Intentionality is not a semantic bridge between mind and world.
> It is the organizational fact that certain experiential patterns remain stable because the world constrains the system from the inside.**

There is no additional relation of aboutness added to experience.
There is only organization under intrinsic necessity.

Reality is singular.
Experience is plural.
And intentional structure appears wherever constraint-stabilized patterns endure.
