## **Status and Scope**

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no ontological primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics**
* introduces **no preferences, values, or reasons**
* does **not** explain motivation, belief, or desire
* does **not** revise any identity claims fixed elsewhere

All ontological, epistemic, and ethical authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md
IER-theory.md
IER-dynamics.md
IER-canon.md
```

If any statement here conflicts with those documents, **those documents take precedence and the conflicting statement here is void**.

## **1. Orientation: Why Futures Are Not Equal**

At many moments, multiple futures are physically admissible.

Yet they are rarely **equally viable**.

Some continuations feel close at hand.
Others feel distant, fragile, or already fading.
Some require little to sustain.
Others demand constant reorganization.

This unevenness appears:

* before deliberation
* without evaluation
* prior to choice
* even in non-experiential systems

IER calls this unevenness **bias**.

---

## **2. What Bias Is (IER Definition)**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

> **Bias is the inherited and evolving geometry of switching costs that determines which futures remain viable under intrinsic constraint.**

Bias is:

* structural, not psychological
* historical, not evaluative
* dynamical, not deliberative

Bias does **not** cause one outcome to occur.
It explains **why some outcomes stop being sustainable earlier than others**.

---

## **3. What Bias Is Not**

Because bias is often conflated with mental states, IER explicitly rejects several interpretations.

Bias is **not**:

* preference
* desire
* belief
* value
* reason
* motivation
* intention

Bias does not “pull” because something is wanted.
It “pulls” because **maintaining some futures is cheaper than maintaining others**.

No semantic or normative machinery is required.

## **4. Sources of Bias**

Bias arises wherever coordination has history.

Common sources include:

* **Sedimented coordination**
  Reused patterns lower switching costs for some futures.

* **Embodiment**
  Bodies impose asymmetric costs on movement, endurance, and recovery.

* **Prior settlement**
  Earlier resolutions reshape what can be sustained later.

* **Environmental scaffolding**
  Tools, infrastructure, and surroundings stabilize some paths.

* **Institutional structure**
  Rules and roles pre-price futures before anyone deliberates.

Bias exists in rocks rolling downhill, in organisms acting automatically, and in cultures persisting traditions.

It is not specific to minds.

---

## **5. Bias Is Dynamic, Not Static**

Bias is not a fixed inheritance.

As time passes:

* coordination deepens
* alternatives decay
* switching costs rise
* reorganization becomes harder

> **Bias intensifies as settlement proceeds.**

This explains:

* urgency
* pressure
* “now or never” feelings
* why late intervention fails
* why delay feels costly even without fear or desire

Futures do not disappear suddenly.
They fade as sustaining them becomes prohibitively expensive.

---

## **6. Bias and Effort**

Effort is not the overcoming of desire.

Under IER:

> **Effort is the cost of sustaining high-bias futures under intrinsic constraint.**

When bias is strong:

* effort rises quickly
* alternatives collapse early
* inertia dominates

This explains:

* temptation without desire
* default collapse under fatigue
* “I knew better but couldn’t sustain it”
* moral struggle without moral psychology

Bias prices futures; effort pays the price.

---

## **7. Bias and Settlement**

Bias and settlement are distinct but tightly coupled.

* **Bias** shapes *which* futures lose viability first.
* **Settlement** is the irreversible loss of those futures.

Settlement is not selection.
Bias is not elimination.

Bias makes some futures fragile;
settlement is when they finally break.

---

## **8. Bias and Choice**

Choice does not eliminate bias.

Choice occurs only when:

* bias is weak, conflicted, or unstable
* multiple futures remain temporarily viable
* additional intrinsic constraint is accepted to sustain them

Choice **reshapes** bias by reorganizing coordination early enough to matter.

This is why:

* timing matters
* last-second resolve fails
* fatigue collapses choice
* choice feels effortful

Choice is not control over outcomes.
It is temporary resistance to bias.

## **9. Bias in Relational Regimes (Clarification)**

Relationships reshape bias without creating shared subjects.

In relational regimes:

* futures may become **jointly expensive or jointly easy**
* switching costs may rise together
* long-horizon coordination may entangle lives

However:

* bias remains **individually borne**
* closure remains **individually fixed**
* ownership does **not** merge

> **Relationships reshape the geometry of future viability across multiple systems without collapsing their closures.**

This applies to:

* love
* family
* friendship
* caregiving
* teams and groups

Bias can be co-shaped without becoming shared ownership.

## **10. Bias Across Domains**

Bias operates across scales:

* individuals default under stress
* couples settle into roles
* families resist reorganization
* institutions preserve procedures
* traditions persist without endorsement
* propaganda stabilizes narratives

In all cases:

* bias explains persistence
* without invoking belief
* without invoking value
* without invoking agency

It is a structural invariant.

---

## **11. What This Article Does Not Claim**

This document does **not** claim that:

* bias explains values
* bias explains moral reasons
* bias explains belief formation
* bias justifies outcomes
* bias confers epistemic authority

Bias is descriptive, not normative.

---

## **12. Closing Statement**

> **Bias is not why one future occurs; it is why others stop being possible.**

It is the quiet geometry beneath effort, temptation, regret, and default collapse.

No preferences are required.
No chooser is invoked.
No ontology is expanded.

Only history, coordination, and the rising cost of change.
