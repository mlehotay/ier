## **Admissible Futures Under Intrinsic Constraint**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**
*Explanatory Article — Non-Normative*

---

## 0. Status, Scope, and Non-Claims

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no new ontological primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics**
* does **not** define when experience exists
* does **not** define moral standing
* does **not** revise the definition of moral harm
* does **not** license aggregation, optimization, or trade-offs

All definitional and ethical authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md
IER-ethics.md
```

This document exists to **surface and clarify** a structural notion already implicit throughout the IER corpus: **admissible futures**.

---

## 1. Motivation: Why Futures Need to Be Made Explicit

Many core commitments of IER already depend on futures, even where the term is not foregrounded.

For example:

* **Intrinsic constraint** is defined by how a system’s **future trajectories** are bound.
* **Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)** are individuated by which **futures are jointly owned**.
* **Agency** is defined as *owned collapse* of alternatives.
* **Moral harm** tracks **irreversible foreclosure** of what could otherwise have continued.

Without an explicit treatment of futures, readers reliably import concepts that IER explicitly rejects—prediction, planning, narrative expectation, probability, or value—into places where only **physical admissibility** is doing work.

The purpose of this document is therefore not to add a new concept, but to **name and discipline** an existing one.

## 2. Futures as Structural Objects (Not Narratives)

### 2.1 What “Future” Means Under IER

Under Informational Experiential Realism, a **future** is:

> a physically admissible continuation of a system under intrinsic constraint.

A future is not a story, intention, expectation, or plan.
It is a **structural possibility** defined by physical law and regime organization.

Accordingly, futures are **not**:

* predictions
* representations
* imagined scenarios
* plans or intentions
* narratives
* probabilities
* values

Those phenomena may *refer to* futures, but they do not *constitute* them.

---

### 2.2 Futures Exist Without Anticipation

Admissible futures do not depend on awareness.

A system may have admissible futures that are:

* never anticipated
* never imagined
* never conceptually representable
* never experientially present

Conversely, a system may anticipate futures that are **not admissible at all**.

IER therefore enforces a strict separation between:

* **what futures exist**, and
* **which futures are experientially accessible**.

This separation mirrors other core IER distinctions (e.g., experience vs epistemic authority).

## 3. Admissible Futures and Intrinsic Constraint

### 3.1 Intrinsic Constraint as Future Narrowing

Intrinsic constraint is not merely pressure in the present.
It is the **binding of future trajectories** at the system level.

A system bears intrinsic constraint when:

* certain continuations are no longer available,
* that unavailability is unavoidable,
* and the system must internally sustain the consequences of that narrowing.

In this sense, experience is inherently **future-structured**: it is what it is like to exist as a system for which some futures are closed and others remain open, under globally binding constraint.

---

### 3.2 Regime-Level Admissibility

Within a Unified Experiential Field:

* admissibility is **global**
* futures are **not factorable** into independent subsystem continuations
* admissible trajectories are defined **at the regime level**

This explains several IER commitments simultaneously:

* why there is at most one dominant UEF per system
* why parallel experiential futures are impossible
* why experiential unity is categorical rather than graded

Admissible futures are therefore **properties of regimes**, not of components.

---

## 4. Choice Spaces as Local Views of Admissible Futures

### 4.1 Choice Spaces (Recap)

IER formalizes admissible futures locally using **choice spaces**.

A choice space is:

* the structured set of admissible successor states
* available from a given configuration
* under the system’s current intrinsic constraint regime

Choice spaces are **descriptive**, not deliberative.
They exist whether or not choice occurs.

---

### 4.2 Availability vs Realization

A crucial distinction:

* **Availability** concerns which futures are admissible.
* **Realization** concerns which future actually occurs.

Admissible futures are about **what could have happened**, not about what did.

This distinction allows IER to explain:

* responsibility without indeterminism
* agency without metaphysical freedom
* harm without outcome comparison

---

## 5. Admissible Futures vs Anticipated Futures

### 5.1 The Required Distinction

IER enforces a sharp distinction between two kinds of “future talk”:

| Structural              | Experiential                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Admissible futures      | Anticipated futures             |
| Physical                | Represented                     |
| Prediction-independent  | Prediction-dependent            |
| Define harm             | Shape urgency and affect        |
| Exist without awareness | Can exist without admissibility |

Collapsing these leads to systematic ethical and conceptual errors.

---

### 5.2 The Critical Asymmetry

Two asymmetries are central:

* **Admissible futures may exist without being anticipated.**
* **Anticipated futures may exist without being admissible.**

This explains:

* surprise when unimagined outcomes occur
* panic over impossible outcomes
* grief for futures that were never viable
* moral harm that occurs without foresight

None of these require epistemic authority.

## 6. Foreclosure of Futures and Moral Harm (Pointer Only)

This document does **not** redefine moral harm.

It clarifies only the structural object that moral harm concerns.

Under IER, experiential moral harm tracks:

* irreversible narrowing,
* distortion,
* or collapse

of a subject’s **admissible futures** under intrinsic constraint.

Harm:

* does not require anticipation
* does not require distress
* does not require blame
* does not disappear through later adaptation

## 7. Futures, Agency, and Ownership

### 7.1 Owned vs Unowned Collapse

Physical systems everywhere undergo future collapse.

Agency exists when:

* collapse occurs **within** a Unified Experiential Field
* the system **owns** that collapse as part of its ongoing regime

Coercion narrows admissible futures while reducing ownership.
It does not erase harm.

---

### 7.2 Why Prediction Does Not Create Agency

Prediction can:

* track futures (often imperfectly)
* mis-track futures
* hallucinate futures

Prediction cannot:

* generate admissibility
* expand future space
* create agency

Agency is a **structural property of owned resolution**, not an epistemic achievement.

---

## 8. Why Futures Are Not Moral Currency

### 8.1 No Counting or Ranking

IER explicitly rejects:

* counting futures
* maximizing future space
* ranking lives by future richness
* comparing subjects by possibility sets

Admissible futures explain **where harm occurs**, not **how to trade it**.

---

### 8.2 Blocking Utilitarian Drift

Loss of many futures is not “worse” than loss of few in any aggregative sense.

Standing is categorical.
Harm is structural.
Magnitude does not become value.

---

## 9. Common Misreadings (Explicitly Blocked)

Under IER:

* Futures ≠ hopes
* Futures ≠ expectations
* Futures ≠ timelines
* Futures ≠ probabilities
* Futures ≠ counterfactual narratives
* Futures ≠ value spaces

Any interpretation that treats futures as epistemic, narrative, or evaluative **misreads their role**.

---

## 10. Relation to the IER Corpus

This document clarifies and supports:

* `IER-choice.md`
* `IER-agency.md`
* `IER-resolution.md`
* `IER-ethics.md`

It introduces **no new authority** and revises **no existing commitments**.

---

## 11. Summary

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* **Admissible futures** are the physically permitted continuations of a system under intrinsic constraint.
* They exist **independently of prediction or awareness**.
* They ground **agency**, **ownership**, and **moral harm** without becoming moral currency.
* IER is **future-structured** without being **future-optimizing**.
