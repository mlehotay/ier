## **Admissible Futures: Structural and Experiential Views**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**
*Explanatory Article — Non-Normative*

---

## 0. Status, Scope, and Framing Discipline

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no new ontological primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, diagnostics, or metrics**
* does **not** define when experience exists
* does **not** define moral standing
* does **not** revise the definition of moral harm
* does **not** license aggregation, optimization, or trade-offs

All ontological and ethical authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md
IER-ethics.md
```

### Framing commitment

This document presents **one structural object — admissible futures — under two equivalent explanatory views**:

* a **structural (physical / third-person)** view, and
* an **experiential (inside-the-regime)** view.

These are not alternative definitions, competing accounts, or distinct entities.
They are two ways of describing **the same constraint structure**, analogous to how IER treats experience itself as having an outside (physical) and an inside (what-it-is-like) description without dualism.

## 1. Motivation: Why Futures Require a Dual Explanatory Treatment

Across the IER corpus, many central claims are already forward-looking:

* intrinsic constraint binds **future trajectories**
* Unified Experiential Fields are individuated by which **futures are jointly owned**
* agency concerns **owned resolution of alternatives**
* moral harm concerns **irreversible foreclosure of what could have continued**

Despite this, discussions of futures reliably collapse into:

* prediction or expectation,
* narrative plans,
* probabilities,
* or value-laden “possible worlds.”

These confusions arise because admissible futures play **two explanatory roles at once**:

1. they structure **dynamics, reachability, and stability** from the outside, and
2. they structure **continuity, identity, and becoming** from the inside.

Treating only one of these perspectives invites systematic misinterpretation.
Treating them as two objects would violate IER’s identity discipline.

The solution is the same one IER already uses for experience itself:
**one structure, two explanatory views.**

## 2. The Single Underlying Object: Admissible Futures

### 2.1 Core Definition (View-Neutral)

An **admissible future** is a physically permitted continuation of a system’s organization of intrinsic constraint that remains compatible with the persistence of a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.

Admissible futures are:

* defined by physical law and regime organization,
* constrained by the system’s present intrinsic-constraint structure,
* shaped irreversibly by the system’s structural history,
* independent of prediction, anticipation, belief, or narrative access.

Admissible futures exist **whether or not** they are anticipated, represented, or even representable by the system.

This definition is **shared by both explanatory views**.

---

## 3. The Structural (Physical / Dynamical) View of Futures

### 3.1 Futures as Reachable, Coherence-Preserving Trajectories

From the structural perspective, admissible futures are:

* **dynamically reachable trajectories**
* through the space of possible intrinsic-constraint organizations
* that preserve **global coherence** of the Unified Experiential Field
* and do not induce regime collapse or fragmentation.

This is the **third-person, dynamical** description of futures.

It does not describe what the system expects, plans, or experiences.
It describes which continuations are **physically viable**.

---

### 3.2 Intrinsic Constraint, Reachability, and Regime Stability

Intrinsic constraint determines:

* which transitions are reachable,
* which reorganizations are viable,
* which perturbations can be absorbed without loss of coherence.

As intrinsic constraint reorganizes over time, the set of admissible futures may:

* shrink,
* expand,
* bifurcate,
* or collapse.

This explains:

* regime stability,
* dominance,
* failure modes,
* and the conditions under which experience ceases.

No representational or epistemic notions are involved.

---

### 3.3 Structural History and Path Dependence

A system’s past persists **not as stored content**, but as **constraints on what it can still become**.

Because intrinsic constraint is reorganized irreversibly:

* identical present configurations may have different admissible futures,
* some future organizations become permanently unreachable,
* others stabilize and remain viable across long durations.

This path dependence:

* does not involve memory storage,
* does not require representation,
* reflects real changes in physical organization.

This is the **dynamics-facing** account of history.

---

## 4. The Experiential (Inside-the-Regime) View of Futures

### 4.1 Futures as What the System Can Still Become

From within a Unified Experiential Field, admissible futures appear as:

* the system’s remaining possibilities for **coherent continuation**,
* what the subject can still *become*,
* what remains viable for identity to persist.

This is not a subjective redefinition of futures.
It is the **inside description** of the same structural constraints.

Where the structural view speaks of reachability,
the experiential view speaks of **becoming**.

---

### 4.2 Continuity Without Recall

Experiential continuity does **not** require:

* narrative memory,
* autobiographical recall,
* representational access to the past.

Continuity requires only that:

* a non-empty set of admissible futures remains,
* and those futures preserve regime coherence.

This explains why:

* subjects persist across unconscious gaps,
* anesthesia and sleep need not destroy identity,
* continuity is forward-structured rather than backward-stored.

---

### 4.3 Memory and Forgetting as Future Viability

From the experiential view:

* **Memory** corresponds to the continued admissibility of certain experiential organizations.
* **Forgetting** corresponds to the loss of future viability of those organizations.

Nothing is erased.
Nothing is deleted.

What changes is **what can still happen**.

Memory and forgetting are therefore not primarily backward-looking phenomena.
They are differences in **future accessibility** under intrinsic constraint.

---

## 5. The Equivalence Claim (No Dualism)

### 5.1 One Structure, Two Views

The structural and experiential views:

* describe the **same admissible futures**,
* differ only in explanatory orientation,
* introduce no additional ontology.

There is no gap to bridge:

* the “inside” is simply what the structure is like when borne,
* the “outside” is what the same structure looks like when described dynamically.

This is exactly parallel to IER’s treatment of experience itself.

---

### 5.2 Explicitly Blocked Misreadings

This dual-view framework does **not** imply:

* two kinds of futures,
* epistemic access to structure,
* representational mediation,
* narrative authority,
* probabilistic interpretation,
* or value ranking.

The views are **explanatory**, not ontological.

---

## 6. Admissible Futures and Moral Harm (Orientation Only)

This document does **not** define moral harm.

It clarifies only the structural object that moral harm concerns.

Under IER, experiential moral harm involves:

* irreversible narrowing,
* distortion,
* or collapse

of a subject’s **admissible futures** under intrinsic constraint.

From the structural view:

* harm is deformation of future-space viability.

From the experiential view:

* harm is forced reorganization of what the subject can still become.

These describe **the same damage**.

Authoritative definitions remain in:

```
IER-ethics.md
```

---

## 7. Why Futures Are Not Moral Currency

Both explanatory views agree on what admissible futures **do not** imply.

IER explicitly rejects:

* counting futures,
* ranking futures,
* maximizing possibility space,
* trading futures across subjects.

Admissible futures explain **where harm occurs**, not **how to optimize outcomes**.

Standing remains categorical.
Magnitude does not become value.

## 8. Relation to the IER Corpus

The **structural view** supports and is used by:

* `IER-dynamics.md`
* `IER-math.md`
* `IER-saturation.md`
* `IER-hysteresis.md`

The **experiential view** supports and is used by:

* `IER-theory.md`
* `IER-continuity.md`
* `IER-memory.md`
* `IER-forgetting.md`
* `IER-persistence.md`

No document redefines admissible futures.
Each selects the explanatory view appropriate to its task.

---

## 9. Summary

* Admissible futures are **physically permitted continuations** under intrinsic constraint.
* They form a **single structural object**.
* That object admits:

  * a **structural / physical** description (reachability, stability),
  * an **experiential** description (continuity, becoming).
* These views are equivalent, not competing.
* Together, they allow IER to explain:

  * dynamics and identity,
  * memory and forgetting,
  * agency and moral harm,
  * without storage, representation, or epistemic privilege.

> **Just as experience is one thing with an inside and an outside,
> admissible futures are one structure with two explanatory faces.**
