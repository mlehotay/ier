## **0. Status, scope, and non-claims**

**Tier:** T2 — Elaboration and application
**Normativity:** Non-normative
**Authority:** Introduces **no new primitives, criteria, diagnostics, or ethical claims**

This article explains **instinct under Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** as a **structural phenomenon**.

It does **not**:

* define experience or Unified Experiential Fields
* attribute or deny experiential standing
* explain agency, intention, or choice
* introduce representations, goals, or teleology
* reduce behavior to psychological or evolutionary narratives

Instinct is treated **purely as inherited constraint geometry**.

---

## **1. Why “instinct” requires rehabilitation**

“Instinct” is routinely misdescribed as:

* stored ancestral knowledge
* hard-coded plans or programs
* unconscious beliefs
* goal-directed competence
* proto-agency or proto-intelligence

These framings rely on **storage, representation, or intention**.

Under IER, none of these are admissible.

If instinct is to be explained at all, it must be explained **without memory, content, goals, or foresight**.

---

## **2. Instinct as inherited constraint topology**

Under IER:

> **Instinct names the inheritance of a narrowed space of admissible futures, not the persistence of past content.**

What is inherited is **not**:

* experiences
* memories
* solutions
* representations

What is inherited **is**:

* a pre-shaped constraint topology
* eliminated alternatives
* viability limits
* narrowed trajectories of continuation

An organism begins life **inside a restricted region of possibility**.
Most alternatives never arise as viable options.

Instinct does not supply answers.
It removes questions.

## **3. Instinct, sedimentation, and learning (disambiguation)**

Instinct is frequently confused with other diachronic processes.
IER distinguishes three structurally different mechanisms.

### **3.1 Instinct (before traversal)**

* inherited deformation of topology
* present **prior to experience**
* produced by evolutionary and developmental filtering

Instinct defines the **starting geometry**.

---

### **3.2 Sedimentation (during traversal)**

* deformation produced by irreversible resolution
* accrues across time within a persisting system
* reshapes future reachability

Sedimentation is history **within a life**.

---

### **3.3 Learning (owned sedimentation)**

* deformation under owned intrinsic constraint
* calibration, refinement, skill acquisition

Learning is **not required** for instinctive behavior to appear.

---

| Process       | When it occurs   | What changes           |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Instinct      | before traversal | starting topology      |
| Sedimentation | during traversal | admissible futures     |
| Learning      | owned traversal  | calibrated deformation |

## **4. Slack, inevitability, and apparent competence**

Instinctive behavior often appears **competent or intelligent**.

Under IER, this appearance arises from **lack of slack**.

When slack is absent:

* deviation collapses immediately
* alternatives terminate early
* only narrow paths permit continuation

The system does not select among options.
Most options **never exist** as viable.

Inevitability is structural, not intentional.

---

## **5. Attractors and recurrence without encoding**

Instinctive forms recur across individuals and environments.

This recurrence does **not** imply:

* shared representations
* encoded templates
* stored solutions

It reflects **soft attractors** in constraint landscapes.

Attractors arise because:

* intrinsic constraints cannot be eliminated
* unstable organizations dissolve
* viable organizations persist

Recurrence is explained by **survivability**, not storage.

---

## **6. Degrees of flexibility without representation**

Instincts vary in rigidity.

Some are highly constrained (e.g., spider webs).
Others are flexible (e.g., mammalian nesting).

IER explains this variation structurally:

* width of attractor basins
* material and environmental tolerance
* repairability of partial failures

Flexibility reflects **topology width**, not internal models.

## **7. Instinct and attention capture**

Instinct is not limited to construction behaviors.

It also governs:

* orienting reflexes
* startle responses
* sexual salience
* fear-triggered narrowing

These phenomena involve **inherited attention-recruitment gradients**.

A local perturbation:

1. generates high tension
2. cannot be resolved locally
3. recruits global participation

No meaning is interpreted.
No desire is consulted.

Attention capture is **forced recruitment**, not choice.

---

## **8. Why instinct feels like “knowing how”**

Instinctive behavior is commonly described as “knowing how.”

This impression arises because:

* failures are brief or invisible
* surviving trajectories dominate observation
* alternatives never accumulate

Observers see only what persists.

The appearance of knowledge is a **selection artifact**, not a cognitive fact.

---

## **9. Explicit misreadings blocked**

Instinct is **not**:

* memory
* representation
* belief
* intention
* goal pursuit
* proto-agency
* proto-experience

No content is recalled.
No plan is executed.
No outcome is represented.

Instinct is **structural**, not cognitive.

---

## **10. Relation to experience and agency (boundary clarification)**

Instinct:

* does **not** require a Unified Experiential Field
* does **not** imply experiential standing
* does **not** ground agency or responsibility

Instinct may shape later experiential content **without constituting experience itself**.

This article remains upstream of:

* agency
* choice
* intention
* ethics

---

## **11. Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* instinct is inherited narrowing of futures
* behavior emerges from survivability, not knowledge
* recurrence occurs without storage
* flexibility occurs without representation
* inevitability arises without intention

Instinct explains **what remains possible**, not **what is known**.

---

## **12. Intermission**

**Structural fact:**
*Instinct is history without memory and competence without knowledge.*

---

## **Explicit closure**

This article introduces no new explanatory axis.

It shows how **organized, repeatable, and adaptive behavior** can arise solely from **pre-shaped constraint geometry**, without invoking memory, representation, goals, or plans.

Under IER:

> **Instinct is the inheritance of a narrowed future, not the persistence of a past.**
