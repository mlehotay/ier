# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v7)**

### *An Organizational Identity Framework for Consciousness and Observers*

---

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) is a realist, physicalist theory of observers and consciousness. It holds that reality exists independently of observation and that conscious experience is neither fundamental nor illusory, but an **emergent organizational property** of certain physical systems. Specifically, consciousness is **identical to the globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential informational dynamics** of a system operating in a particular regime, termed the **Phenomenal Information Layer (PIL)**.

IER rejects mind-dependent ontologies, panpsychism, and dualism. Consciousness does not create reality, nor does it float above physical processes. Rather, it is **what certain informational dynamics are like from the inside** when instantiated in systems capable of unified self- and world-modeling over time.

IER is an organizational theory: it specifies *what consciousness is* and *when it occurs*, without privileging any particular physical substrate.

## **1. Objective Reality**

IER affirms **physical realism**.

Reality exists independently of observers, experiences, or representations. Physical states and laws unfold regardless of whether they are perceived or modeled. Observers do not generate, collapse, or co-create reality through observation; only **physical interactions among systems** have causal power.

Experience interprets reality.
It does not constitute it.

---

## **2. Observers as Informational Systems**

An **observer** is a physical system defined by its **informational organization**, not by biology or consciousness.

A system qualifies as an observer if it:

* Persists as a coherent informational pattern over time
* Integrates information across internal subsystems
* Maintains internal models of both external conditions and its own state
* Regulates its behavior using those models from a unified internal control structure

Observerhood does **not** require conscious experience. Many observers operate entirely without phenomenality.

Observers are **embedded systems**, not epistemic primitives.

---

## **3. Internal Models and Perspective**

Observers construct **internal informational models** of:

* The external environment
* Their own internal state and capacities

These models are:

* Physically instantiated
* Entirely internal to the system
* Shaped by structure, history, and constraints

What is commonly called *perspective* is not a property of reality, but a property of **how information is organized and accessed within an observer**. Different observers may model the same reality differently without altering that reality.

Perspective is an **organizational fact**, not a metaphysical one.

## **4. Consciousness and the Phenomenal Information Layer (PIL)**

### **4.1 What PIL Is**

Consciousness occurs when an observer’s informational dynamics enter a regime called the **Phenomenal Information Layer (PIL)**.

PIL is **not**:

* a module
* a spatial location
* a separate ontological layer
* a substance or force

PIL **is** a system-wide **mode of operation** characterized by:

* Global integration of informational states
* Recursive access to internal models
* Temporal continuity of informational dynamics
* Unified availability of information for regulation, learning, and action

### **4.2 The Identity Claim**

IER makes the following core claim:

> **Conscious experience is identical to the ongoing, globally integrated informational dynamics of a system operating in a functional PIL regime.**

Consciousness is not something added to information processing.
It is not caused by information processing plus an extra ingredient.

It is **what those dynamics are like when instantiated in a unified system**.

There is no further metaphysical layer beyond the dynamics themselves.

---

## **5. Qualia**

**Qualia** are not intrinsic properties of external objects, nor non-physical entities.

They are:

* System-relative informational states
* Defined by their internal structure, integration, and role within PIL
* Accessible only to the system in which they occur

Their apparent privacy arises from **exclusive internal access**, not metaphysical isolation.

Differences in qualia correspond to differences in informational dynamics. There is no further fact beyond those differences.

---

## **6. Affect and Valence**

Affective states (e.g., pain, pleasure, attraction, aversion) arise from **regulatory informational processes** that:

* Monitor conditions relevant to system stability
* Bias attention, learning, and behavior
* Assign priority and salience to internal states

Affect does not add representational content.
It **weights experience**.

Affective dynamics are phenomenally real because they are:

* Globally integrated
* Regulation-relevant
* Constitutive of the system’s control landscape

Under IER, *feeling good or bad* is what certain regulatory informational dynamics are like from the inside.

---

## **7. Emergence and Constraints**

Consciousness is **emergent but constrained**.

It occurs only when informational organization satisfies **joint conditions**, including:

* High integration
* Recursive self-modeling
* Temporal continuity
* Unified control and access

Many complex systems fail to meet these constraints and therefore do not experience consciousness.

Emergence here is **organizational identity**, not causal magic.

## **8. System Taxonomy**

| System Type                        | Observerhood | Integrated Self-Models | Consciousness     |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| Non-informational physical systems | ❌            | ❌                      | ❌                 |
| Dynamically complex non-observers  | ❌            | ❌                      | ❌                 |
| Reactive informational systems     | ❌            | ❌                      | ❌                 |
| Distributed adaptive systems       | ⚠️           | ❌                      | ❌                 |
| Minimal observers                  | ✅ (limited)  | ⚠️                     | Low–Indeterminate |
| Integrated biological observers    | ✅            | ✅                      | Moderate–High     |
| Complex conscious observers        | ✅            | ✅                      | High              |
| Artificial observer systems        | ✅            | ⚠️–✅                   | Indeterminate     |
| Aggregate social systems           | ❌            | ❌                      | ❌                 |

Observerhood and consciousness are **distinct properties**. Consciousness requires observerhood, but observerhood does not guarantee consciousness.

## **9. Ontology and Metaphysical Commitments**

IER rejects:

* Mind-dependent existence
* Observer-created realities
* Dualism
* Panpsychism

IER affirms:

* One objective physical reality
* Consciousness as a real, system-relative phenomenon
* Organizational identity between experience and informational dynamics

There is no further explanation for *why* these dynamics feel like something—just as there is no deeper explanation for why mass curves spacetime or why acceleration feels like falling.

---

## **10. Relation to Contemporary Theories**

### **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**

IER agrees that integration matters but rejects panpsychism and the identification of consciousness with a scalar quantity. Integration is **necessary, not sufficient**.

### **Global Workspace Theory (GWT)**

IER agrees that global availability is crucial but replaces broadcast metaphors with **system-wide dynamical regimes** and treats phenomenality as intrinsic rather than merely functional.

### **Predictive Processing (PP)**

IER accepts internal modeling and inference as foundational but holds that prediction alone does not entail experience. Consciousness requires specific organizational conditions beyond inference.

IER can be seen as a **unifying organizational refinement** of insights from these theories without their ontological excesses.

## **11. Summary**

Some systems react.
Some systems observe.
Some systems experience.

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

> **Experience is not something a system has.
> It is what a system is doing, when its informational dynamics are globally integrated, temporally continuous, and self-referential.**

There is one reality.
Consciousness occurs within it.
And it feels the way it does because **that is what those dynamics are like from the inside**.
