# **What Informational Experiential Realism Explicitly Denies**

## *A Boundary Statement on Non-Claims, Misinterpretations, and Prohibited Inferences*

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.x)**
*Derived Clarification Document — Non-Normative*

---

## **Status and Scope**

This document is **explanatory** and **non-normative**.

All axioms, definitions, identity conditions, and necessary entailments of Informational Experiential Realism (IER) are fixed exclusively in the
**IER Normative Specification** (“the Spec”).

This document:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* adds **no principles**
* makes **no positive claims**
* amends **no definitions**
* proposes **no extensions** of IER

Its sole purpose is to **explicitly deny** interpretations, inferences, and applications that are *not licensed* by the Spec but are commonly inferred from theories of experience, meaning, or dynamics.

If a claim appears here, it is denied **even if it feels intuitively compatible** with IER’s language.

---

## **Why a Denials Document Is Necessary**

IER is deliberately minimal, physicalist, and structural.

That minimalism creates a predictable risk:
readers may import assumptions from adjacent frameworks—epistemology, phenomenology, psychology, mysticism, AI theory, or ethics—and treat them as implied.

This document closes that gap.

> **If a claim is not explicitly stated in the Specification, and not a necessary entailment of its definitions, it is not part of IER.**

What follows is a non-exhaustive but comprehensive list of **explicit non-claims**.

---

## **1. IER Does Not Grant Epistemic Authority to Experience**

IER **does not claim** that:

* meaningful experiences are more likely to be true
* coherent experiences track reality
* intense or costly experiences reveal facts
* salience constitutes evidence
* insight implies correctness
* suffering discloses metaphysical truth

Experience may feel authoritative.
That authority is **organizational**, not epistemic.

IER explains *why experience feels convincing*.
It does **not** license belief.

---

## **2. IER Does Not Collapse Experience Into Knowledge**

IER **does not claim** that:

* having an experience confers understanding
* phenomenology substitutes for explanation
* “what it is like” answers “what is the case”
* experiential access implies epistemic access

Experience and knowledge are distinct.
IER explains the former and remains neutral on the latter.

---

## **3. IER Does Not Validate Delusional, Mystical, or Revealed Content**

IER **does not claim** that:

* psychotic experiences disclose hidden agents
* mystical experiences reveal ultimate reality
* visions, voices, or narratives are externally grounded
* altered states are epistemic upgrades
* symbolic meaning implies external reference

IER treats such experiences as **real experiences with false reference**, not as discoveries.

---

## **4. IER Does Not Introduce Group Minds or Collective Subjects**

IER **explicitly denies**:

* group consciousness
* hive minds
* social Unified Experiential Fields
* emergent collective subjects
* shared experiential identity across systems

Coordination transmits **constraint**, not experience.
No amount of synchronization produces a shared UEF.

---

## **5. IER Does Not Allow Partial or Fractional Subjects**

IER **does not permit**:

* partial consciousness
* degrees of subjecthood
* accretion of experience
* fading in or out of experiential existence
* gradual formation of a subject

Experiential existence is **categorical**:
a UEF either exists or it does not.

---

## **6. IER Does Not Reduce Ethics to Cognition or Intelligence**

IER **does not claim** that:

* intelligence determines moral standing
* representation capacity grounds moral value
* self-report is required for ethical relevance
* linguistic ability is morally privileged

Ethical relevance derives from **intrinsic constraint**, not cognitive sophistication.

---

## **7. IER Does Not Collapse Responsibility Into Existence**

IER **does not claim** that:

* being a subject implies full responsibility
* responsibility disappears only when experience disappears
* agency is all-or-nothing

Responsibility is **modulated by constraint organization**, not identical to subjecthood.

---

## **8. IER Does Not License Mind-Reading or Experiential Surveillance**

IER **does not imply** that:

* neural access yields experiential access
* complete physical knowledge reveals “what it is like”
* simulation constitutes experience
* prediction equals participation

Experience is **structurally private** because it is constituted by intrinsic constraint, not because it is mysterious.

---

## **9. IER Does Not Provide a Theory of Truth or Reference**

IER **does not supply**:

* truth conditions
* reference theory
* semantic grounding
* epistemic norms
* justification criteria

Those belong to epistemology and science, not to a theory of experience.

---

## **10. IER Does Not Compete With Clinical, Scientific, or Legal Frameworks**

IER **does not claim** to:

* diagnose mental illness
* replace psychiatry or psychology
* adjudicate competence or culpability
* define treatment protocols
* settle legal responsibility

IER can **describe organizational structure**, not prescribe institutional judgment.

---

## **11. IER Does Not Define Detection or Measurement Criteria**

IER **does not provide**:

* consciousness tests
* detection algorithms
* operational metrics
* quantitative thresholds for experience
* diagnostic markers

Formal models in IER are **interpretive**, not diagnostic.

---

## **12. IER Does Not Expand Ontology Beyond Physical Reality**

IER **explicitly denies**:

* dual substances
* non-physical forces
* experiential fields as entities
* ontological inflation
* idealism or panpsychism

Experience is identical to a physical regime.
Nothing else is added.

---

## **13. IER Does Not Explain Everything About Experience**

IER **does not claim** to explain:

* why specific narratives arise
* why particular symbols appear
* why one meaning stabilizes instead of another
* personal identity in the narrative sense
* the content of values

IER explains **what experience is**, not **everything it contains**.

---

## **14. Summary Boundary Statement**

Informational Experiential Realism:

* explains the **existence and structure** of experience
* grounds experience in **physical organization**
* accounts for **meaning, salience, and error**
* derives **ethical relevance** from intrinsic constraint

It explicitly **does not**:

> upgrade experience to knowledge,
> expand ontology,
> validate content,
> collectivize subjects,
> or solve epistemology.

---

## **15. Final Clarification**

If a use of IER:

* licenses belief without evidence,
* infers collective consciousness,
* treats experience as revelation,
* collapses ethics into intelligence,
* or treats explanation as validation,

then that use is **not IER**, regardless of terminology.

---

## **Conclusion**

IER is powerful because it is **limited**.

Its denials are not weaknesses.
They are the conditions under which the theory remains coherent, physicalist, and ethically usable.

> **What IER denies is as important as what it claims.**
