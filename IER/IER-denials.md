## **What Informational Experiential Realism Explicitly Denies**

### *A Tier-3 Boundary Statement on Non-Claims, Misinterpretations, and Prohibited Inferences*

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.3)**  
**Tier:** 3 — Misuse & Misreading Containment  
**Status:** Non-normative, constraint-enforcing  

---

## **Status and Scope**

This document is **non-normative** and **constraint-enforcing**.

All axioms, definitions, identity conditions, and necessary entailments of Informational Experiential Realism (IER) are fixed exclusively in the
**IER Normative Specification** (“the Spec”).

This document:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* adds **no principles**
* makes **no positive claims**
* amends **no definitions**
* proposes **no extensions** of IER

Its sole purpose is to **explicitly deny** interpretations, inferences, and applications that are *not licensed* by the Spec but are commonly inferred from theories of experience, meaning, agency, or dynamics.

If a claim appears here, it is denied **even if it feels intuitively compatible** with IER’s language.

---

## **Modal Legend**

For clarity, this document distinguishes:

* **Explicitly denied** — incompatible with the Spec (contradiction)
* **Not claimed** — neither stated nor entailed by the Spec

Both are **outside IER**.

---

## **Why a Denials Document Is Necessary**

IER is deliberately minimal, physicalist, and structural.

That minimalism creates a predictable risk:
readers import assumptions from adjacent frameworks—epistemology, phenomenology, psychology, mysticism, AI theory, ethics—and treat them as implied.

This document closes that gap.

> **If a claim is not explicitly stated in the Specification, and not a necessary entailment of its definitions, it is not part of IER.**

What follows is a representative, high-coverage list of **explicit non-claims**.

---

## **1. IER Does Not Grant Epistemic Authority to Experience**

IER **does not claim** that:

* meaningful experiences are more likely to be true
* coherent experiences track external reality
* intense or costly experiences reveal facts
* salience constitutes evidence
* insight implies correctness
* suffering discloses metaphysical truth

Experience may *feel* authoritative.
That authority is **organizational**, not epistemic.

IER explains *why experience can feel compelling*.
It does **not** license belief.

---

## **2. IER Does Not Collapse Experience Into Knowledge**

IER **does not claim** that:

* having an experience confers understanding
* phenomenology substitutes for explanation
* “what it is like” answers “what is the case”
* experiential access implies epistemic access

Experience and knowledge are distinct.
IER explains the former and remains neutral on the latter.

---

## **3. IER Does Not Validate Delusional, Mystical, or Revealed Content**

IER **does not claim** that:

* psychotic experiences disclose hidden agents
* mystical experiences reveal ultimate reality
* visions, voices, or narratives are externally grounded
* altered states are epistemic upgrades
* symbolic meaning implies external reference

IER treats such states as **real experiences with false or indeterminate reference**, not as discoveries.

That some experiences feel revelatory is explained by **high internal constraint**, not by privileged access to truth.

---

## **4. IER Does Not Introduce Group Minds or Collective Subjects**

IER **explicitly denies**:

* group consciousness
* hive minds
* social Unified Experiential Fields
* emergent collective subjects
* shared experiential identity across systems

Coordination transmits **constraint**, not experience.
Shared information channels do **not** imply shared cost-location.

No amount of synchronization produces a shared UEF.

---

## **5. IER Does Not Allow Partial, Fractional, or Graded Subjects**

IER **explicitly denies**:

* partial consciousness
* degrees of subjecthood
* accretion of experience
* fading in or out of experiential existence
* gradual formation of a subject

Experiential existence is **categorical**:
a UEF either exists or it does not.

IER **does not claim** that regime boundaries are epistemically sharp or practically detectable.

---

## **6. IER Does Not Reduce Ethics to Cognition, Intelligence, or Representation**

IER **does not claim** that:

* intelligence determines moral standing
* representational capacity grounds moral relevance
* self-report is required for ethical consideration
* linguistic or planning ability is morally privileged

Ethical relevance derives from **intrinsic constraint**, not cognitive sophistication.

---

## **7. IER Does Not Collapse Responsibility Into Mere Existence**

IER **does not claim** that:

* being a subject implies full responsibility
* responsibility disappears only when experience disappears
* agency is all-or-nothing
* moral accountability follows automatically from subjecthood

Responsibility is **modulated by constraint organization**, coercion, impairment, and offloading—not identical to experiential existence.

IER also **does not require freedom from causation** for agency.
Choice consists in **internally borne resolution of constraints**, not exemption from physical law.

---

## **8. IER Does Not License Mind-Reading or Experiential Surveillance**

IER **does not imply** that:

* neural access yields experiential access
* complete physical description reveals “what it is like”
* simulation constitutes experience
* prediction equals participation
* third-person reconstruction recovers first-person character

Experience is **structurally private** because it is constituted by intrinsic constraint, not because it is mysterious.

---

## **9. IER Does Not Provide a Theory of Truth, Reference, or Semantics**

IER **does not supply**:

* truth conditions
* reference theory
* semantic grounding
* epistemic norms
* justification criteria

Those belong to epistemology and the sciences, not to a theory of experience.

---

## **10. IER Does Not Compete With Clinical, Scientific, or Legal Frameworks**

IER **does not claim** to:

* diagnose mental illness
* replace psychiatry or psychology
* adjudicate competence or culpability
* define treatment protocols
* settle legal responsibility

IER can **describe organizational structure**, not prescribe institutional judgment.

---

## **11. IER Does Not Define Detection, Measurement, or Consciousness Tests**

IER **does not provide**:

* consciousness tests
* detection algorithms
* operational metrics
* scalar “levels of consciousness”
* quantitative thresholds for experience
* diagnostic markers for standing

Formal models in IER are **interpretive**, not diagnostic.
No proxy measure licenses attribution of subjecthood.

---

## **12. IER Does Not Entail Computationalism or Substrate Independence**

IER **explicitly denies** that:

* correct functional organization alone suffices for experience
* computational equivalence guarantees experiential equivalence
* simulation or emulation preserves subjecthood
* copying preserves “the same subject”
* uploading ensures survival or continuity of self

Experience depends on **physically instantiated intrinsic constraint**, not abstract role realization.

---

## **13. IER Does Not Treat Autopoiesis or Operational Closure as Necessary or Sufficient**

IER **explicitly denies** the inference that:

* autopoiesis is **necessary** for a Unified Experiential Field (UEF), or
* autopoiesis is **sufficient** for a Unified Experiential Field (UEF), or
* operational closure (in the sense used in autopoiesis traditions) is **necessary or sufficient** for experience.

Autopoiesis and operational closure may be historically associated with attempts to characterize living systems and self-maintaining organization, but under IER they do **not** function as criterial machinery.

> **Non-Inference:** Autopoiesis and operational closure are neither necessary nor sufficient for a Unified Experiential Field; their role in IER is historical and explanatory only.

IER’s identity claim turns on **globally integrated, temporally continuous intrinsic constraint** as defined by the Spec, not on self-production vocabulary, biological self-maintenance, or closure-as-slogan.

---

## **14. IER Does Not Expand Ontology Beyond Physical Reality**

IER **explicitly denies**:

* dual substances
* non-physical forces
* experiential fields as entities
* ontological inflation
* idealism or panpsychism

Generic causation or minimal constraint is **not** experience.
A UEF is a **narrow organizational kind**, and most physical systems do not qualify.

---

## **15. IER Does Not Explain Everything About Experience**

IER **does not claim** to explain:

* why specific narratives arise
* why particular symbols appear
* why one meaning stabilizes instead of another
* personal identity in the narrative or autobiographical sense
* the content of values
* why a particular qualitative character feels the way it does

IER explains **what experience is**, not **everything it contains**.

---

## **16. IER Does Not Deliver a Complete Moral Theory or Algorithm**

IER **does not claim** to:

* rank lives or experiences
* aggregate harms into a single metric
* resolve tragic tradeoffs
* yield action-determining rules
* provide policy-ready thresholds

IER identifies **morally real entities and irreversible harms**.
It does not replace ethical reasoning, judgment, or pluralistic value deliberation.

---

## **17. Common Misuse Patterns (All Not IER)**

The following inferences are **explicitly disallowed**:

* “This experience felt meaningful, therefore it is true.”
* “The system passed the test, therefore it is conscious.”
* “The group coordinated, therefore it is a subject.”
* “The upload is me.”
* “Experience proves moral rightness.”
* “Explanation licenses belief.”

Each violates boundaries stated above.

---

## **18. Final Boundary Statement**

If a use of IER:

* licenses belief without evidence,
* treats experience as revelation,
* infers collective consciousness,
* collapses ethics into intelligence,
* assumes substrate-independent subjecthood,
* treats explanation as validation,

then that use is **not IER**, regardless of terminology.

---

## **Conclusion**

IER is powerful because it is **limited**.

Its denials are not weaknesses.
They are the conditions under which the theory remains coherent, physicalist, and ethically usable.

> **What IER denies is as important as what it claims.**
