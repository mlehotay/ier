# **IER-choice-topology**

## **Status and scope**

This article performs a **structural identification** within the IER corpus.

Its purpose is to make explicit something that is already true but has remained implicit across multiple articles: the object described as **choice space**, **admissible futures**, and **topology** is **one and the same structure**, viewed under different explanatory projections.

This article introduces:

* no new primitives
* no new dynamics
* no criteria, diagnostics, or thresholds

It exists to **reduce redundancy**, **prevent category drift**, and **stabilize terminology** across `IER-choice.md`, `IER-futures.md`, and `IER-topology.md`.

Nothing in this article licenses traversal, deliberation, preference, or evaluation.
Nothing here explains how futures collapse, how paths are taken, or how history accumulates.

This is an **identificatory** article only.

## **Why the confusion keeps arising**

The confusion this article resolves is not conceptual error.
It is a predictable consequence of using **different vocabularies for the same structure** in different explanatory contexts.

Across the corpus:

* *choice space* appears when discussing agency, responsibility, and action
* *admissible futures* appears when discussing time, continuity, and constraint
* *topology* appears when discussing global structure presupposed by all of the above

Each term arose to solve a local explanatory problem.
None were intended to introduce a distinct ontological object.

However, because these vocabularies are introduced in different chapters and applied to different questions, readers (and authors) naturally infer multiplicity:

> *Are there three things here?
> Or one thing described three ways?*

The correct answer is **one thing**.

This article makes that explicit.

## **Choice space**

A **choice space** is the structured set of **admissible successor states** available to a system at a given moment, under intrinsic constraint.

Structurally:

* it exists **prior to any action**
* it includes **multiple non-realized alternatives**
* it is defined by **what can still happen**, not by what is wanted, preferred, or selected
* it is shaped by physical law, system organization, and prior constraint deformation

Crucially:

* a choice space is **not deliberative**
* it does **not** require reflection, awareness, or comparison
* it exists whether or not a system can survey or represent it

In IER, the term *choice space* is used because it aligns with how this structure **feels from within a Unified Experiential Field** once agency is present.

But nothing about the structure itself depends on agency.

---

## **Admissible futures**

**Admissible futures** are the same structure described from a different explanatory stance.

Instead of asking:

> *What can this system choose?*

the admissible-futures vocabulary asks:

> *Which futures remain physically reachable under intrinsic constraint?*

Structurally:

* admissible futures are defined by **reachability**, not selection
* they include futures that will never occur
* they are constrained by the same global structure as choice spaces
* they narrow, deform, or collapse as constraint accumulates

The distinction between *internal* and *external* descriptions matters here:

* from outside the system, admissible futures appear as a constrained branching structure
* from within a Unified Experiential Field, the same structure appears as *possibility*, *option*, or *choice*

No new object is introduced by changing descriptions.

Only the explanatory projection changes.

## **Topology**

**Topology** names the fact that both choice spaces and admissible futures presuppose a **global constraint geometry**.

Topology is not:

* a graph of options
* a list of alternatives
* a representation inside the system

Topology refers to:

* how states are connected
* which transitions are permitted
* which deformations persist
* which regions of state space are inaccessible, fragile, or irreversible

When IER speaks of topology, it is speaking about the **structure that makes both choice spaces and admissible futures possible at all**.

Topology is therefore:

* more abstract
* less agent-facing
* strictly structural

But it is not a different thing.

It is the **same object**, named at a different level of description.

## **The identification**

The identification is simple and strict:

> **Choice space, admissible futures, and topology are the same structure described under different explanatory projections.**

More precisely:

* *choice space* is the **inside-the-regime** description when agency is salient
* *admissible futures* is the **outside-the-regime** description emphasizing reachability
* *topology* is the **structural description** that abstracts away from perspective entirely

None of these can replace the others:

* topology is too abstract to explain lived agency
* choice language is too perspective-bound to do structural work
* admissible-futures language lacks phenomenological alignment

But none introduce additional structure.

There is only **one object**.

## **Consequences of the identification**

Making this identification explicit clarifies several downstream claims already present in the corpus.

### **Forward-structured memory**

If identity and persistence are grounded in ownership of admissible futures, then memory need not consist in stored past content.

The system is shaped by **what it can still undergo**, not by what it retains.

### **Identity without recall**

Personal identity persists through deformation of the same topological structure, even when experiential access to the past is lost.

Nothing needs to be retrieved for continuity to hold.

### **Agency without deliberation**

Because choice space exists prior to and independently of deliberation, agency does not require reflective selection.

Traversal of the structure can be owned even when it is automatic, pressured, or unreflective.

These consequences are not new claims.
They follow directly from recognizing that the same structure is doing all the work.

## **What this article does not do**

This article does **not**:

* explain how futures collapse
* describe traversal, resolution, or control
* analyze sedimentation or hysteresis
* introduce evaluation, preference, or optimization
* provide experiential or ethical criteria

All of those topics are handled elsewhere, using the same underlying structure now explicitly identified.

---

## **Intermission**

**Structural fact:**
*A single constraint geometry can support agency, identity, and time without containing any of them as primitives.*
