## **Drafting `IER-choice-topology.md` (T2)**

### Article identity

* **Tier:** T2 — Structural identification
* **Document type:** Canon-governed unification article
* **Purpose:** To establish that *choice space*, *admissible futures*, and *topology* are the same structure described under different vocabularies

This article is **identificatory**, not dynamic.

---

### Central thesis (must appear clearly)

> **What is called “choice space” in agency contexts and “admissible futures” in formal contexts is the same topological structure viewed under different explanatory projections.**

---

### Canon constraints (do not violate)

* Do **not** describe traversal, curing, or sedimentation
* Do **not** introduce:

  * evaluation
  * preference
  * comparison
  * representation
* Topology must remain **purely structural**
* Choice space must remain **non-deliberative**

---

### Required conceptual alignments

This article must harmonize terminology across:

* `IER-choice.md`
* `IER-futures.md`
* `IER-topology.md`

It exists to **reduce redundancy and ambiguity** elsewhere in the corpus.

### Outline (must be followed closely)

1. **Status and scope**

   * Why this identification needs to be explicit

2. **Why the confusion keeps arising**

   * Linguistic and conceptual sources of apparent multiplicity

3. **Choice space**

   * Structural definition
   * Local admissibility without selection

4. **Admissible futures**

   * Reachability under intrinsic constraint
   * Internal vs external descriptions

5. **Topology**

   * Constraint geometry presupposed by both
   * No graphs-as-options reading

6. **The identification**

   * One structure, three vocabularies
   * Why none can replace the others

7. **Consequences of the identification**

   * Forward-structured memory
   * Identity without recall
   * Agency without deliberation

8. **What this article does not do**

   * No dynamics
   * No sedimentation
   * No experiential criteria

9. **Intermission**

### What success looks like

A reader should walk away unable to ask:

> “Are choice space and admissible futures different things?”

because the answer is now obviously **no**.
