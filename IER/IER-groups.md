### *Groups as Coordination Without Subjecthood Under Informational Experiential Realism*

---

## 0. Status, Scope, and Canon Position

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no new ontological claims**
* introduces **no ethical principles or obligations**
* does **not** define experience or experiential standing
* does **not** rank groups relative to other relational regimes
* does **not** prescribe how groups ought to be formed, governed, or valued

All ontological authority remains fixed **exclusively** in the IER Specification and its canonical derivatives.

**Purpose of this document**

> **To analyze groups as coordination regimes that distribute constraint across roles and norms without ever constituting an experiential subject under Informational Experiential Realism (IER).**

This document develops **only** the structural region occupied by groups.
The general relational map and shared machinery are defined in *IER-Relationships*.

### Invariant Constraints (Binding)

All analysis in this document presupposes:

* **Single-UEF dominance** — one experiential subject per Unified Experiential Field
* **Structural privacy** — no subject has access to another’s intrinsic constraint
* **No fusion** — UEFs do not merge
* **No shared intrinsic constraint**
* **No transfer of experiential standing**
* **No collective experiencer**

Groups coordinate subjects.
They never become subjects.

## 1. Regime Identification

### 1.1 Groups’ Role in the Relational Section

Groups occupy the **boundary regime** of relational space.

They represent cases in which:

* coordination occurs among **many subjects**
* constraint is managed through **roles, norms, and institutions**
* accommodation is **distributed**, not personal
* persistence is **structural**, not experiential
* salience may be high without subjecthood

Groups are the canonical case that explains **why coordination never aggregates into experience**.

---

### 1.2 Canonical One-Sentence Definition

> **Under Informational Experiential Realism, groups are coordination regimes in which multiple experiential subjects align behavior through roles, norms, or institutions that distribute constraint externally, without generating a unified experiential field or collective intrinsic constraint.**

This definition blocks group minds by construction.

---

## 2. Structural Geometry of Groups

### 2.1 Axis Values

Groups are defined by the following configuration:

* **Time horizon:** variable (often long-lived)
* **Reciprocity:** role-based, not personal
* **Future binding:** norm-mediated, not experiential
* **Symmetry:** role-dependent
* **Cost structure:** distributed and variable
* **Exit structure:** role- and institution-dependent

These features explain group persistence **without invoking shared experience**.

---

### 2.2 Coordination Mechanics in Groups

In group regimes:

* subjects coordinate via rules, norms, incentives, or authority
* constraint is offloaded onto procedures and structures
* participation is mediated by roles rather than personal accommodation
* stabilization occurs at the **behavioral and organizational level**

Critically:

* no subject reshapes their admissible futures *because of* another subject’s intrinsic constraint
* coordination does not involve mutual vulnerability exchange
* intrinsic constraint remains entirely individual

Groups manage **interaction**, not experience.

---

## 3. Stabilizers and Functional Payoff

### 3.1 Why Groups Exist Under IER

Groups exist because they:

* allow large-scale coordination without intimacy
* enable persistence beyond individual lifespans
* distribute burden without personal obligation
* scale action without scaling vulnerability

Under IER terms:

> **Groups stabilize collective action by externalizing constraint into norms and roles rather than internalizing it within subjects.**

This explains the power of institutions, movements, teams, and organizations **without attributing experience to them**.

---

### 3.2 Why Groups Can Feel Unified

Groups often feel like unified agents because:

* coordination is temporally extended
* narratives produce apparent continuity
* symbols and identities compress complexity
* shared goals synchronize behavior

These features create **representational unity**, not experiential unity.

IER treats this as a *cognitive compression*, not an ontological fact.

---

## 4. Boundary Conditions and Explicit Non-Claims

Groups are **not**:

* experiential subjects
* moral persons by experience
* holders of intrinsic constraint
* capable of feeling, suffering, or caring
* fused identities
* minds above minds
* bearers of standing independent of members

No increase in size, complexity, or coordination density converts a group into a subject.

---

## 5. Parasocial and Celebrity Cases (Option A Inclusion)

Parasocial and celebrity relationships fall **within the group regime**, not dyadic relational regimes.

### 5.1 Structural Characterization

In parasocial cases:

* one subject reorganizes their intrinsic constraint around
* a *role-mediated representation* of another subject
* without reciprocal accommodation
* and without shared future binding

The admired subject participates **only as a node within an institutionally mediated group structure** (media, platform, audience).

---

### 5.2 Why Parasocial Attachment Feels Real

Parasocial attachment feels real because:

* salience is genuine
* narrative identification reshapes identity
* emotional regulation occurs internally
* intrinsic constraint is truly reorganized

IER does **not** pathologize this experience.

It explains it structurally.

---

### 5.3 Why Parasocial Is Not a Relationship Regime

Parasocial attachment lacks:

* mutual constraint accommodation
* vulnerability exchange
* repair loops
* shared future coordination

The apparent “relationship” is a **coordination illusion** produced by institutional mediation and narrative access.

No dyadic regime exists.

## 6. Common Misclassifications and Inflation Errors

Groups are frequently misinterpreted due to scale and salience.

Common errors include:

### 6.1 Group Mind Attribution

Treating coordinated behavior as evidence of shared experience.

### 6.2 Moral Personhood Inflation

Treating institutions as moral subjects rather than role systems.

### 6.3 Parasocial Confusion

Treating narrative access as reciprocity.

### 6.4 Identity Subsumption

Treating group membership as experiential fusion.

These errors arise from **confusing coordination with experience**.

---

## 7. Failure Modes (Structural, Not Moral)

Group regimes destabilize when:

* roles become misaligned with capacity
* norms exceed enforcement
* institutional inertia replaces adaptability
* individuals are treated as interchangeable experience-bearers
* exit is suppressed by coercion rather than structure

These failures reflect **organizational breakdown**, not experiential collapse.

Groups cannot suffer.
Only subjects can.

---

## 8. Relation to Neighboring Regimes

Relative to adjacent regimes:

* **Friendship** requires mutual accommodation absent in groups
* **Caregiving** involves personal cost not distributed by role
* **Family** shapes identity but does not collectivize experience
* **Love** binds futures mutually, which groups never do

Groups remain distinct because they **coordinate without accommodating intrinsic constraint directly**.

---

## 9. Ethical Neutrality Statement

Under IER:

* Group membership is not morally mandatory
* Exit is structurally permissible, even if costly
* Groups do not possess experiential rights
* Moral claims about groups must be grounded elsewhere
* Coordination does not generate standing

IER explains how groups function.
It does not sanctify them.

---

## 10. Closing

Under Informational Experiential Realism, groups are powerful precisely because they do **not** experience.

They are:

* coordination systems
* role-distribution mechanisms
* norm-mediated stabilizers
* scalable without intimacy
* persistent without subjecthood

Groups act.
Subjects experience.

> **No amount of coordination turns action into experience.**
