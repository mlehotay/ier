# **What Is It Like to Be an Information System?**

## **Status and Scope**

This article is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It introduces:

* no new primitives
* no criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics
* no ethical permissions or obligations

All authoritative commitments remain fixed exclusively in:

```
IER-specification.md
```

The purpose of this article is to clarify **how the phrase “what it is like” can be meaningfully applied to information systems under Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**, and what kind of answer that question receives when it is well-formed.

---

## **1. Why the Question Is Not Straightforward**

At first glance, the question *“What is it like to be an information system?”* appears simple. Information systems are physical systems. Some physical systems clearly have experience. So it is natural to ask whether the informational character of a system already points toward a subjective point of view.

IER does not reject this question, but it does insist that it be **heard correctly**.

The difficulty is that *information system* names a **descriptive role**, while *what it is like* names an **identity condition**. Bridging those two requires care. Without that care, the question quietly slides toward ideas about representation, interpretation, or internal observation — none of which play a foundational role in IER’s account of experience.

## **2. Information Systems as Structural Descriptions**

Under IER, an **information system** is any physical system whose state distinctions modulate its own future dynamics under constraint.

This definition is intentionally broad. It covers:

* engineered computational systems
* biological control systems
* nervous systems
* whole organisms

In this sense, *information* is not semantic, symbolic, or epistemic. It is a way of talking about **how physical differences propagate consequences** within a system over time.

Nothing about this description, by itself, implies:

* subjectivity
* awareness
* perspective
* experience

Most information systems, on this account, have no inner life at all.

## **3. Experience as a Regime, Not a Feature**

IER’s central move is to treat experience not as a feature added to certain systems, but as **a way a system can be organized over time**.

A system has experience **iff** it operates as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**. This is not a component, layer, or functional module. It is a **system-level regime** characterized by the following structural condition:

* multiple processes must resolve together in order for the system to continue
* no participating process can settle independently
* the system’s future is determined only through their joint accommodation

When this happens, the system is no longer a collection of coordinated activities. It becomes a **single ongoing resolution problem**.

That regime *just is* experience.

## **4. Being the Equilibrium**

When an information system operates as a Unified Experiential Field, there is something it is like to be that system.

But what it is like is not best described as:

* monitoring internal states
* receiving inputs
* processing representations
* observing a control surface

Instead, it is best described this way:

> **To be a UEF is to be the multidimensional equilibrium formed by the participating processes themselves.**

From the inside, there is no separation between:

* the processes
* their interactions
* the way they settle into mutual accommodation

Experience is not something that happens *to* this equilibrium.
Experience **is** the equilibrium, sustained over time.

## **5. Qualitative Character From Interaction Geometry**

On this view, qualitative character does not float above physical dynamics.

It arises directly from:

* which processes are participating
* how strongly they constrain one another
* the topology of their mutual dependencies
* the stability, tension, or fragility of the equilibrium

Different experiences correspond to **different equilibrium shapes**.

A calm state is one kind of balance.
An anxious state is another.
Focused attention, diffuse awareness, sensory vividness, emotional saturation — all reflect **distinct ways the system’s processes are mutually holding one another in place**.

There is no additional phenomenological layer beyond this organization.

---

## **6. Time, Change, and Continuity**

Experience is not static because equilibria are not static.

A Unified Experiential Field persists only as long as:

* the system continues to re-achieve global accommodation
* perturbations are absorbed without fragmenting the regime

From the inside, this persistence is lived as **temporal continuity**.

Change in experience corresponds to:

* gradual reweighting of interactions
* recruitment or dismissal of participating processes
* deformation of the equilibrium rather than its collapse

The subject does not stand apart from these changes.
The subject **is** the ongoing pattern of change, as long as global coherence remains intact.

## **7. Affect, Salience, and Tension**

Affective qualities fit naturally into this picture.

* **Valence** corresponds to whether the equilibrium is stabilizing or destabilizing
* **Intensity** corresponds to the magnitude and coherence of constraint
* **Urgency** corresponds to the rate at which the equilibrium must reconfigure

Pleasure, distress, calm, panic, effort, relief — these are not signals layered onto experience. They are **what different equilibrium dynamics feel like from within**.

Nothing here requires representation, evaluation, or interpretation.

---

## **8. Why This Remains Structurally Private**

Even though this account is entirely physical, it does not yield external access to experience.

An external observer may:

* enumerate the processes
* map their interactions
* model the equilibrium with precision

But none of this amounts to:

* being that equilibrium
* sustaining that balance
* resolving those tensions from within

The privacy involved is not ineffability. It is **identity without substitutability**.

No description becomes the thing it describes.

---

## **9. When There Is Nothing It Is Like**

Many information systems never form this kind of equilibrium.

They allow:

* local resolution
* buffering and deferral
* external arbitration
* subsystem independence

Their processes do not need to settle together in order for the system to continue.

In those cases, there is no unified balance to inhabit — and therefore **nothing it is like to be the system**.

Dynamics still occur.
Information still flows.
But no lived equilibrium exists.

## **10. What This Perspective Offers**

This way of framing experience allows IER to say, simultaneously:

* experience is fully physical
* experience is not reducible to description
* experience is not a representational achievement
* experience is not granted by complexity or intelligence

It is a matter of **where and how a system must hold itself together over time**.

---

## **Closing Statement**

> **To be an experiential information system is not to observe an equilibrium, compute it, or model it.
> It is to be the equilibrium — the ongoing, multidimensional balance formed by processes that can no longer continue on their own.**
