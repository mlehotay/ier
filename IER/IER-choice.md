## **Status and Normative Authority**

**This document is NON-NORMATIVE.**

It provides an **interpretive and structural account** of *choice* within the framework of
**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.6)**.

This document:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or sufficiency conditions**
* introduces **no ethical principles**
* does **not** define experience
* does **not** detect or measure agency
* does **not** ground moral standing

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in the
**IER v10.6 Normative Specification**.

> *If any statement in this document conflicts with the Specification, the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void.*

## **Abstract**

Physical systems frequently undergo transitions in which multiple futures are possible and one is realized. Such transitions resemble deliberative choice and have historically generated confusion about agency, responsibility, and free will.

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) resolves this confusion by distinguishing **choice-shaped transitions** from **choice proper**, and by introducing a mid-order informational structure: the **Choice Space**.

A Choice Space is the structured set of admissible future states and transitions generated by intrinsic constraint. It exists prior to action, supports counterfactuals, accumulates history, and constrains future possibility. When such a structure is globally integrated within a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**, traversal of the Choice Space constitutes *choice*, and collapse of alternatives becomes *owned*.

This document introduces the Choice Space and its graph representation, explains how narrative arises as a realized path through it, and shows how responsibility, coercion, and compulsion are naturally understood as structural modifications of the same underlying object.

## **1. Why “Choice” Requires Structural Clarification**

Everyday accounts of choice treat it as:

* a momentary act
* a conscious decision
* a metaphysical power
* or a narrative illusion

These framings obscure what choice *requires* structurally.

IER treats choice neither as a primitive faculty nor as a semantic overlay on behavior. Instead, choice is understood as a **regime-level phenomenon** that presupposes a structured space of alternatives and a system capable of owning their resolution.

That structured space is the **Choice Space**.

---

## **2. Choice-Shaped Transitions**

Many physical processes exhibit **choice-shaped transitions**:

* more than one future is dynamically admissible
* one future is realized
* others are foreclosed

Such transitions occur in:

* stochastic physical systems
* probabilistic computation
* algorithmic branching
* noise-driven dynamics

Choice-shaped transitions alone are **not choices**.

They involve branching and collapse, but no ownership.

---

## **3. The Choice Space (Mid-Order Structure)**

A **Choice Space** is the structured set of admissible future states and transitions generated by intrinsic constraint.

It is:

* not a mental representation
* not a belief set
* not a utility surface
* not an optimization problem
* not a narrative construct

It is an **informational structure**.

IER places the Choice Space at a **mid-order (≈2.5th order)** of description:

* derived from intrinsic constraint (second order)
* prior to agency and owned resolution (third order)

The Choice Space exists **whether or not it is ever owned**.

---

## **4. Representing Choice Spaces: Constraint Graphs**

Interpretively, a Choice Space may be represented as a **directed constraint graph**.

### **4.1 Structure**

* **Nodes** correspond to informational states the system could occupy.
* **Directed edges** correspond to admissible transitions under intrinsic constraint.
* **Direction** reflects temporal or causal ordering.

The graph represents **what could happen**, not what will.

No claim is made that systems explicitly compute, store, or enumerate such graphs. The graph is a **descriptive tool**, not an implementation requirement.

---

### **4.2 What the Graph Is Not**

The constraint graph is **not**:

* a decision tree
* a policy graph
* a belief graph
* a moral ranking
* a diagnostic marker of agency

It carries no semantics by itself.

---

### **4.3 Structural Operations (Interpretive Only)**

Without formal development, the structure supports familiar notions:

* **reachability** (what futures remain possible)
* **pruning** (loss or foreclosure of options)
* **bottlenecks** (forced transitions)
* **cycles** (habit, compulsion)
* **path dependence** (history constrains future)

These notions are used descriptively only.

---

## **5. Traversal, Collapse, and Ownership**

A **path** through a Choice Space corresponds to a realized sequence of states.

Traversal alone does not constitute choice.

Choice arises only when traversal occurs under **ownership**.

---

### **5.1 Ownership of Alternatives**

A system *owns* a choice when:

* unrealized alternatives remain relevant to its ongoing dynamics
* collapse of the Choice Space constrains the system’s future *from the inside*
* the cost of resolution cannot be externalized

Ownership is **organizational**, not psychological or epistemic.

Under IER, ownership exists **iff** the Choice Space is globally integrated within a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.

---

### **5.2 Choice Proper**

> **Choice** is the owned traversal and collapse of a Choice Space by a system sustaining a Unified Experiential Field.

From this it follows that:

* randomness alone never produces choice
* determinism does not eliminate choice
* choice is derived, not primitive
* choice is regime-bound, not ubiquitous

---

## **6. Narrative as Path**

A **narrative** is a realized path through a Choice Space.

* **Past**: the traversed path
* **Present**: the current node
* **Future**: the remaining reachable subgraph

Narrative structure arises from **owned traversal**, not from storytelling, representation, or memory alone.

This explains why narrative supports counterfactuals, responsibility, and identity over time.

---

## **7. Responsibility, Coercion, and Compulsion**

Responsibility tracks **ownership of collapse**, not freedom from causation.

---

### **7.1 Responsibility**

Responsibility increases when:

* the Choice Space is internally generated
* alternatives are preserved rather than externally pruned
* traversal occurs under stable global integration

Responsibility is **graded**.

Standing is not.

---

### **7.2 Coercion**

Coercion deforms the Choice Space by:

* externally pruning nodes or edges
* shifting cost from intrinsic constraint to imposed threat

Traversal may still occur, but ownership is reduced.

---

### **7.3 Compulsion and Overload**

In compulsion, addiction, or extreme stress:

* the Choice Space may be dominated by cycles or narrow bottlenecks
* global integration may be unstable

Ownership of traversal degrades even though experience persists.

---

## **8. Relation to Agency and Free Will**

IER defines **agency** as the capacity of a Unified Experiential Field to resolve intrinsic informational tension through its own globally integrated dynamics.

Choice presupposes agency but is not identical to it.

This structural account dissolves the traditional free-will dichotomy:

* **Libertarianism** mistakes branching for authorship.
* **Eliminativism** mistakes lawfulness for lack of ownership.

IER shows that:

> **Choice is not randomness and not miracle.
> It is lawful collapse of a Choice Space whose cost is borne from the inside.**

---

## **9. Scope Limits**

This document does **not**:

* define experience or agency
* provide diagnostics for choice
* quantify responsibility
* propose decision procedures
* justify moral standing
* license optimization or control

It clarifies structure only.

---

## **10. Summary**

* Choice requires a structured space of alternatives
* That structure is the **Choice Space**
* Choice Spaces may be represented as **constraint graphs**
* Traversal alone is not choice; **ownership is decisive**
* Narrative is a realized path through a Choice Space
* Responsibility tracks ownership, not freedom
* Lawfulness and choice are fully compatible

> **The world contains many possible futures.
> Choice occurs only where a system must live with the ones it forecloses.**
