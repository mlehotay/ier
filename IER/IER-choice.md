## **Status and Normative Authority**

**This document is NON-NORMATIVE.**

It provides an **explanatory and structural account** of *choice* under
**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.2)**.

This document:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or sufficiency conditions**
* introduces **no ethical principles**
* does **not** define experience or agency
* does **not** detect, measure, or certify choice
* does **not** ground moral standing

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md   (v10.8.2)
```

If any statement in this document conflicts with the Specification, **the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

### **Global Informational Language Disclaimer**

All uses of *information*, *informational structure*, *choice space*, *state*, *transition*, *graph*, and *path* in this document are **descriptive shorthand only**.

They refer exclusively to:

> **physically instantiated state distinctions that modulate a system’s own future dynamics under intrinsic constraint**,
> as defined in **IER Specification II.A (Physical Information)**.

No representational, semantic, deliberative, or epistemic notions are introduced.

---

### **Epistemic Boundary (Explicit)**

Experiential structure — including choice, ownership, salience, narrative coherence, or felt inevitability — confers **no epistemic authority** about mind-independent reality.

This document presupposes **IER Specification Principle 10 (Epistemic Non-Authority)**.

---

## **Abstract**

Physical systems frequently undergo transitions in which multiple futures are physically admissible and one is realized. Such transitions resemble deliberative choice and have historically generated confusion about agency, responsibility, and free will.

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) resolves this confusion by distinguishing **choice-shaped transitions** from **choice proper**, and by introducing a **derived mid-order structure**: the **Choice Space**.

A Choice Space is the structured set of admissible successor states and transitions generated by intrinsic constraint. It exists prior to action, supports counterfactual alternatives, accumulates history, and constrains future possibility. When — and only when — such a structure is **globally integrated within a Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**, traversal of the Choice Space constitutes *choice*, and collapse of alternatives becomes *owned*.

This document explains the Choice Space, its interpretive graph representation, how narrative arises as a realized path through it, and how responsibility, coercion, and compulsion are understood as structural modifications of the same underlying object.

---

## **1. Why “Choice” Requires Structural Clarification**

Everyday accounts of choice variously treat it as:

* a momentary act
* a conscious decision
* a metaphysical power
* a narrative illusion

These framings obscure what choice **requires structurally**.

IER treats choice neither as a primitive faculty nor as a semantic overlay on behavior. Instead, choice is a **regime-bound phenomenon** that presupposes:

1. a structured space of admissible alternatives, and
2. a system capable of **owning** the collapse of those alternatives.

The structured space is the **Choice Space**.
Ownership is supplied only by a **Unified Experiential Field**.

---

## **2. Choice-Shaped Transitions**

Many physical processes exhibit **choice-shaped transitions**:

* more than one future is physically admissible
* one future is realized
* others are foreclosed

Such transitions occur in:

* stochastic physical systems
* probabilistic computation
* algorithmic branching
* noise-driven dynamics

Choice-shaped transitions alone are **not choices**.

They involve branching and collapse, but **no ownership**.

---

## **3. The Choice Space (Derived Mid-Order Structure)**

A **Choice Space** is the structured set of admissible future states and transitions generated by intrinsic constraint.

It is:

* not a representation
* not a belief set
* not a utility surface
* not an optimization problem
* not a narrative construct

It is a **derived organizational structure**.

IER places the Choice Space at a **mid-order of description**:

* derived from intrinsic constraint
* prior to agency and owned resolution

A Choice Space may exist **whether or not it is ever owned**.

---

## **4. Representing Choice Spaces (Interpretive Only)**

Descriptively, a Choice Space may be represented as a **directed constraint graph**.

### **4.1 Structure**

* **Nodes** correspond to physically admissible system states
* **Directed edges** correspond to admissible transitions under constraint
* **Direction** reflects lawful temporal or causal ordering

The graph represents **what could happen**, not what will.

No claim is made that systems compute, store, or enumerate such graphs.
The representation is **purely descriptive**.

---

### **4.2 What the Graph Is Not**

The constraint graph is **not**:

* a decision tree
* a policy graph
* a belief graph
* a moral ranking
* a diagnostic marker of agency or experience

It carries no semantics by itself.

---

### **4.3 Descriptive Structural Operations**

Interpreted structurally, the graph supports notions such as:

* **reachability** (remaining possible futures)
* **pruning** (loss or foreclosure of options)
* **bottlenecks** (forced transitions)
* **cycles** (habit or compulsion)
* **path dependence** (history constrains future)

These notions are **descriptive only**.

---

## **5. Traversal, Collapse, and Ownership**

A **path** through a Choice Space corresponds to a realized sequence of states.

Traversal alone does **not** constitute choice.

Choice arises only when traversal occurs under **ownership**.

---

### **5.1 Ownership of Alternatives**

A system *owns* a choice when:

* unrealized alternatives remain dynamically relevant
* collapse of alternatives constrains future trajectories **from within the system**
* the cost of resolution cannot be externally resolved or offloaded

Ownership is **organizational**, not psychological or epistemic.

Under IER, ownership exists **iff** the Choice Space is globally integrated within a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.

---

### **5.2 Choice Proper**

> **Choice** is the owned traversal and collapse of a Choice Space by a system sustaining a Unified Experiential Field.

From this it follows:

* randomness alone never produces choice
* determinism does not eliminate choice
* choice is **derived**, not primitive
* choice is **regime-bound**, not ubiquitous

$\text{Traversal} \neq \text{choice without intrinsic constraint}$.

---

### **5.3 Choice-Shaped Structure Without Experience**

Highly structured, choice-shaped transitions may occur **outside any Unified Experiential Field**.

Such structures may:

* instantiate branching futures
* exhibit constraint-shaped alternatives
* undergo collapse to a realized path
* even resemble deliberation or decision-making

However, under IER they **do not constitute choice**, because they lack:

* global intrinsic constraint
* ownership of collapse
* temporal continuity
* accumulated internal cost
* narrative persistence

Without a sustaining regime:

* alternatives are not owned
* collapse bears no internal consequence
* unrealized futures leave no trace

Such structures dissolve because **nothing must live with what was foreclosed**.

---

## **6. Narrative as Path Through a Choice Space**

A **narrative** is a realized path through an owned Choice Space:

* **Past** — the traversed path
* **Present** — the current node
* **Future** — the remaining reachable subgraph

Narrative structure arises from **owned traversal**, not from representation, storytelling, or memory alone.

This explains why narrative supports:

* counterfactuals
* responsibility attribution
* diachronic identity

---

## **7. Responsibility, Coercion, and Compulsion**

Responsibility tracks **ownership of collapse**, not freedom from causation.

---

### **7.1 Responsibility**

Responsibility increases when:

* the Choice Space is internally generated
* alternatives are preserved rather than externally pruned
* traversal occurs under stable global integration

Responsibility is **graded**.
Standing is not.

---

### **7.2 Coercion**

Coercion deforms the Choice Space by:

* externally pruning nodes or edges
* imposing forced transitions
* shifting cost from intrinsic to imposed constraint

Traversal may still occur, but ownership is reduced.

---

### **7.3 Compulsion and Overload**

In compulsion, addiction, or extreme stress:

* Choice Spaces may collapse into cycles or bottlenecks
* global integration may degrade

Ownership of traversal diminishes even though experience persists.

---

## **8. Relation to Agency and Free Will**

IER defines **agency** as the capacity of a Unified Experiential Field to resolve intrinsic constraint through its own globally integrated dynamics.

Choice **presupposes** agency but is not identical to it.

This structural account dissolves the traditional free-will dichotomy:

* **Libertarianism** mistakes branching for authorship.
* **Eliminativism** mistakes lawfulness for lack of ownership.

> **Choice is not randomness and not miracle.
> It is lawful collapse of alternatives whose cost is borne from the inside.**

---

## **9. Scope Limits**

This document does **not**:

* define experience or agency
* provide diagnostics for choice
* quantify responsibility
* propose decision procedures
* justify moral standing
* license optimization or control

It clarifies **structure only**.

---

## **10. Summary**

* Choice requires a structured space of alternatives
* That structure is the **Choice Space**
* Choice Spaces may exist without being owned
* Traversal alone is not choice; **ownership is decisive**
* Narrative arises from owned traversal
* Responsibility tracks ownership, not indeterminism
* Randomness can generate structure but not experience

> **The world contains many possible futures.
> Choice occurs only where a system must live with the ones it forecloses.**
