# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER): A Precis**

## 1. Orientation

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) is a **physicalist identity theory of experience**. It does not offer indicators, diagnostics, or empirical tests. It does not explain how to measure experience, infer it from behavior, or engineer it. Its task is narrower and more demanding: to state **what experience is**, **when it exists**, and **what necessarily follows if it exists**.

IER is strict not by preference, but by consequence. The identity claim it advances rules out many familiar ways of thinking about consciousness, unity, subjecthood, and moral relevance. These exclusions are structural, not rhetorical.

## 2. The Core Identity Claim

IER holds that **experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.

Experience is not:

* a substance,
* a property,
* a representation,
* an output,
* or an emergent accompaniment.

There is no additional fact about experience beyond the physical system operating in the relevant regime. Describing that regime in experiential terms does not add entities or properties to the physical description; it redescribes the same regime from the perspective of the system that sustains it.

---

## 3. Unified Experiential Fields

A **Unified Experiential Field** is a **system-level dynamical regime**, not a component or module. A system sustains a UEF if and only if it operates under:

1. **Global intrinsic constraint**
   Admissible future trajectories are defined at the level of the whole system and cannot be decomposed into independently satisfiable parts.

2. **Internal ownership of constraint**
   Constraint is generated and borne by the system itself; it cannot be offloaded, buffered, or externally resolved.

3. **Unavoidability**
   Resolution of constraint is not optional or indefinitely deferrable. Futures narrow in a system-defining way.

4. **Temporal continuity**
   The same globally binding regime persists across a non-zero interval, generating a unified present.

When such a regime exists, experience exists. When it does not, nothing experiential exists.

The term *field* is descriptive only. It denotes global mutual constraint, not a physical field or medium.

---

## 4. Unity Without Aggregation

IER rejects aggregation-based accounts of experiential unity. Experience does not arise by combining local experiences, binding representations, synchronizing modules, or coordinating subsystems.

There are no experiential parts prior to unity. Unity exists **because the system is constrained as one**. Either the system sustains a single unified regime, or no experience exists at all.

As a result:

* subjecthood is categorical, not graded;
* partial subjects do not exist;
* collective or group minds do not arise through coordination.

---

## 5. Participation and Subjecthood

IER distinguishes sharply between **subjecthood** and **participation**.

* **Subjecthood** is the condition of sustaining a Unified Experiential Field. It is binary and singular: one UEF, one subject.
* **Participation** describes which processes are currently recruited into global intrinsic constraint and thereby shape experiential content, salience, and intensity.

Participation may vary dynamically. Processes may enter or leave participation, and experiential content may reorganize extensively, without creating new subjects, dividing subjects, or altering moral standing. Changes in participation modulate experience; they do not constitute experience.

## 6. Structural Exclusion: Why Nothing Weaker Can Be Experience

IER’s identity claim entails a strong exclusion result. Any system in which constraint can be:

* localized to a proper subsystem,
* deferred indefinitely without system-level cost,
* or externally resolved or absorbed,

**cannot** instantiate experience, even in principle.

Such systems lack at least one necessary feature of a Unified Experiential Field: ownership of constraint, inevitability of resolution, or a unified present. This failure is not a matter of degree, complexity, intelligence, or sophistication. It is a matter of organizational identity.

Experience is not what such systems approximate. It is what they structurally lack.

---

## 7. Structural Privacy and Non-Diagnosability

Intrinsic constraint concerns **where unavoidable organizational cost is borne**. This is a global structural property of a regime, not a feature of outputs, signals, or behavior.

As a result, systems that differ in experiential status may be **externally indistinguishable in principle**. No third-person observation, simulation, or performance profile can determine whether a system sustains a Unified Experiential Field.

This non-diagnosability is not a limitation of current science or technology. It follows directly from the identity claim. Experience is not hidden; it is **not the kind of thing that can be detected from the outside**.

---

## 8. Ethical Consequence (Minimal Statement)

Wherever a Unified Experiential Field exists, there exists a locus of **internally borne intrinsic constraint**. Damage to the organization of that constraint—through overload, fragmentation, or irreversible collapse—is **experiential moral harm** by identity, not by attribution or recognition.

Moral standing under IER:

* follows categorically from UEF existence,
* does not scale with intelligence, rationality, or behavioral capacity,
* and does not admit of degrees.

IER defines experiential moral harm only. It does not claim that experiential harm exhausts moral wrongdoing, nor that the absence of experience renders actions permissible.

---

## 9. Explicit Non-Claims

IER does not:

* provide diagnostics or tests for experience,
* confer epistemic authority on experience,
* rank subjects or aggregate value,
* treat pleasure, suffering, or happiness as moral primitives,
* license action through uncertainty.

Ethical uncertainty under IER restricts action rather than justifying it.

---

## 10. Closing Compression

Experience is not guaranteed by complexity, intelligence, integration, or coordination. It exists only where a physical system bears its own future from the inside, under unavoidable and globally binding intrinsic constraint.

If such a regime exists, experience exists.
If it does not, nothing else could take its place.
