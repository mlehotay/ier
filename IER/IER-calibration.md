## **Calibration Drift as Structural Sedimentation**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.x)**
*Illustrative Article — Non-Normative*

## **Status and Scope**

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no new ontological primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics**
* introduces **no epistemic access claims**
* introduces **no experiential identity claims**
* introduces **no ethical principles**

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md
IER-theory.md
IER-dynamics.md
IER-math.md
IER-canon.md
```

All informational language is used strictly as **descriptive shorthand** for
**physically instantiated state distinctions that modulate a system’s own future dynamics under constraint**, as defined in *IER-specification II.A*.

This article serves as a **worked illustration** of the structural mechanisms described in **`IER-sedimentation.md`**, and the resulting behavioral signature described in **`IER-hysteresis.md`**.

It introduces **no claims about memory**.

## **0. Orientation: Why Calibration Looks Like Memory**

When a system’s responses change over time in a persistent way, observers naturally reach for cognitive language:

* the system has *learned*
* it *remembers* past conditions
* it has *adapted* based on experience

These descriptions feel intuitive because the system’s **future responses depend on its past**.

Under Informational Experiential Realism, this inference is structurally mistaken.

Calibration drift provides a clear case where:

* nothing is stored
* nothing is represented
* nothing is recalled

yet the system **cannot respond as it once did**.

> **Orientation signal:**
> *Nothing is remembered — yet nothing responds as before.*

## **1. Calibration as Constraint Geometry**

### **1.1 What Calibration Is**

Calibration is not knowledge.
It is not information.
It is not representation.

Calibration consists in the **geometric features** of a system’s response under constraint:

* thresholds at which transitions occur
* sensitivity ranges
* response curves
* trigger points and tolerances

To calibrate a system is to specify **how constraint propagates** as conditions vary.

Calibration answers questions like:

* *When does this response activate?*
* *How sharply does it respond?*
* *How much deviation is tolerated before reorganization occurs?*

None of these require memory.

---

### **1.2 Why Calibration Is Not Storage**

A calibrated system does not contain:

* records of prior states
* logs of past inputs
* representations of history
* latent content awaiting access

It contains only **present-tense physical structure** that governs which future transitions are admissible.

If calibration changes over time, it is because that structure has been **irreversibly deformed**, not because past events persist internally.

---

## **2. Canonical Case: Mechanical Thermostats**

### **2.1 Direct Mechanical Coupling**

Consider a simple mechanical thermostat:

* a bimetallic strip
* spring tension
* physical expansion and contraction
* direct coupling between temperature and mechanical response

There is:

* no digital memory
* no register
* no state archive
* no symbolic encoding

The thermostat responds lawfully to temperature changes by crossing mechanically defined thresholds.

---

### **2.2 Drift Through Repeated Resolution**

Over many heating and cooling cycles:

* materials fatigue
* spring tensions subtly change
* contact points wear
* expansion responses shift

Each individual cycle resolves constraint and then passes.
No cycle is retained.
No temperature history is stored.

Yet over time:

* the trigger point drifts
* activation occurs earlier or later
* overshoot or undershoot becomes more likely

The thermostat has not *remembered* previous temperatures.

Instead:

> **The space of admissible future responses has been irreversibly reshaped.**

---

## **3. Irreversibility Without Traces**

### **3.1 Drift Is Not Simple Failure**

Calibration drift is often described as *wear* or *error*.
This framing is misleading.

A drifting thermostat:

* still operates lawfully
* still responds to temperature
* still resolves constraint

Nothing has “broken” in the sense of a discrete malfunction.

What has changed is **how the system must now respond**.

Drift is **structural deformation**, not failure of operation.

---

### **3.2 Repair Versus Reset**

No trace of past cycles exists inside the thermostat.

There is no component that encodes:

* yesterday’s temperature
* last winter’s usage
* how often it switched

Yet returning the system to its original calibration would require:

* mechanical re-tensioning
* component replacement
* structural reorganization

The past persists **only** as lost alternatives.

This is irreversibility without storage.

---

## **4. Calibration Drift as Sedimentation**

### **4.1 Mapping Directly to Sedimentation**

Under the definition in `IER-sedimentation.md`:

> **Sedimentation** is the irreversible deformation of admissible futures caused by prior constraint resolution.

Calibration drift fits this definition exactly:

* constraint is repeatedly resolved
* independence-preserving pathways collapse
* future transitions are permanently altered

No memory is involved.
No representation is formed.

History is written into **constraint geometry itself**.

---

### **4.2 The Hysteresis Signature**

Calibration drift also displays the signature described in `IER-hysteresis.md`:

* identical present temperatures can yield different responses
* behavior depends on the trajectory taken
* returning to prior behavior requires repair, not reset

This is hysteresis produced by sedimentation.

---

## **5. Additional Mechanical Illustrations**

### **5.1 Dented Micrometers**

A micrometer dented through use:

* loses precision
* narrows its measurement range
* cannot recover accuracy without repair

The dent does not encode the event that caused it.

It simply removes possible futures.

---

### **5.2 Stripped Threads and Lost Coupling Modes**

When threads are stripped:

* certain alignments become impossible
* torque transmission changes
* configurations are lost permanently

Again:

* no record exists
* no history is stored
* only admissible structure is reduced

---

### **5.3 One Structure, Many Mechanisms**

Thermostats, micrometers, and stripped threads differ mechanically.

Structurally, they are identical:

> **Past resolution has reshaped what the system can now do.**

---

## **6. The Role of Informational Slack (Applied)**

Some systems resist calibration drift because they retain **informational slack**:

* replaceable components
* adjustable buffers
* modular recalibration pathways
* external correction mechanisms

Such systems dissipate history.

When slack is exhausted:

* constraint “sticks”
* deformation accumulates
* sedimentation occurs

Calibration drift therefore illustrates **slack exhaustion in action**.

---

## **7. Non-Experiential Boundary Clarification**

Calibration drift appears in:

* governors
* regulators
* mechanical feedback loops
* adaptive but non-experiential control systems

None of these require:

* intrinsic constraint
* ownership of resolution
* unified experiential continuity

Therefore:

> **Calibration drift does not imply experience.**

This blocks any inference from adaptation or history to subjecthood.

---

## **8. Boundary Note: Calibration Drift Inside a UEF**

When calibration drift occurs **within** a system that already sustains a Unified Experiential Field:

* deformation of constraint is internally borne
* future narrowing is globally binding
* certain responses may feel inevitable or automatic

This introduces:

* no epistemic authority
* no memory content
* no access to the past

It marks only a **structural condition** that later accounts of habit, skill, trauma, and memory will recruit.

## **Intermission — Structural Fact**

> **The system does not recall what happened.
> It can no longer respond as if it hadn’t.**
