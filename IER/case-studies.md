### **A Non-Imagistic, Single-Channel Experiential System**

**Introductory Illustration Text**

> This illustration describes a cognitively typical adult system whose experiential organization differs markedly from imagery-centric and multi-stream models commonly assumed in cognitive science.
>
> The system reports a complete absence of voluntary sensory imagery during waking cognition (visual, auditory, or somatic), while retaining intact reasoning, memory, emotional life, and behavioral competence. Thought proceeds primarily through abstract, conceptual, and relational structures rather than perceptual simulation.
>
> Inner speech is present but not continuous. It is selectively recruited for tasks such as reading, deliberate reasoning, or reflective self-analysis, and can become repetitive when unresolved internal constraints persist. Outside these conditions, cognition is experienced as silent and non-verbal.
>
> Attention operates in a strictly single-channel manner: at any moment, one globally dominant focus occupies the experiential field. Competing thoughts do not coexist phenomenologically but instead replace one another across time. This organization confers unusually strong attentional stability and makes practices such as focused meditation subjectively effortless.
>
> Despite the absence of imagery, the system reports a coherent sense of self, stable temporal continuity, affective depth, and reliable engagement with external reality. Dreams, however, involve vivid sensory imagery, suggesting that imagery capacity exists but is excluded from waking experiential participation.
>
> This case illustrates that a Unified Experiential Field can be highly coherent, affective, and stable while remaining non-imagistic, non-narrative by default, and strictly single-channel—supporting IER’s claim that experience depends on intrinsic constraint and global integration rather than representational modality.

### **Endogenous Qualitative Stabilizers (“Brainfeels”)**

**Introductory Illustration Text**

> This illustration examines a class of internally generated qualitative experiences reported within a stable Unified Experiential Field. These experiences are described as sensory-like—possessing texture, temperature, and material qualities—yet are not tied to external stimuli, perceptual imagery, or hallucination.
>
> The experiences recur reliably under specific internal conditions, including neuromodulatory shifts (e.g., medication timing), interoceptive bodily states (particularly gastrointestinal signaling), and emotionally salient memory activation. They are experienced as globally present within the experiential field rather than localized thoughts or representations.
>
> Each experience forms a stable qualitative pattern with a consistent character across occurrences and is often named by the system for ease of recognition. These patterns may layer or transform as internal constraints change, shifting in emotional tone, intensity, or perceived function while remaining recognizably related.
>
> Importantly, these experiences do not disrupt reality testing, fragment experiential unity, or generate external attributions. Instead, they appear to organize diffuse internal constraint into coherent qualitative forms, allowing the Unified Experiential Field to maintain stability under complex or competing internal pressures.
>
> This case illustrates that qualitative experience under IER need not be perceptual, representational, or externally anchored. Internally generated qualitative attractors can function as endogenous stabilizers of intrinsic constraint, expanding the range of experiential content predicted by the framework without introducing new primitives.

### **Psychosis as Constraint Misattribution and Regime Destabilization**

**Introductory Illustration Text**

> This illustration concerns psychosis not as a categorical break from reality, but as a specific mode of failure in the organization of intrinsic constraint within an experiential system.
>
> In psychotic states, internally generated constraint—originating from affective, mnemonic, or predictive processes—ceases to be correctly localized as intrinsic to the system. As a result, qualitative or narrative structures that would ordinarily remain internal are misattributed to external sources, leading to delusions, hallucinations, or disrupted self-world boundaries.
>
> Crucially, the experiential field may remain globally unified and temporally continuous during early or moderate psychosis. The failure lies not in the existence of experience, but in the system’s capacity to correctly regulate, interpret, and contain intrinsic constraint without external projection.
>
> This illustration is used to contrast psychotic destabilization with non-pathological internal qualitative experiences. It demonstrates that rich internally generated phenomenology alone does not imply psychosis. What distinguishes psychosis under IER is the loss of correct constraint attribution and the resulting breakdown of reliable system-relative causality.
>
> The case supports IER’s account of psychosis as a regime instability rather than a metaphysical anomaly, and clarifies why similar internal experiences may be benign or harmful depending on their integration, attribution, and regulatory role within the Unified Experiential Field.
