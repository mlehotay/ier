# **Canonical Narratives as Informational Attractors (IER Companion)**

### *How Stories, Instincts, and Genetic Knowledge Encode Intrinsic Constraint*

---

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) characterizes experience as a categorical organizational regime arising under intrinsic informational constraint. This companion article extends IER to explain the persistence and recurrence of **canonical narratives** - stable story-forms that appear across cultures, species, and biological scales - without invoking supernatural ontology, collective minds, or symbolic realism.

Under IER, canonical narratives are **externally transmissible informational attractors** that encode the topology of intrinsic constraint characteristic of experiential systems. They preserve and communicate patterns of unavoidable tension, irreversible transition, and identity-defining resolution in a compressed, portable form.

Crucially, these same constraint topologies also appear **internally instantiated** in biological systems through genetic inheritance. Instinctive behaviors - such as a spider’s web construction - are not learned stories, but **hard-coded experiential trajectories** shaped by evolution. Human storytelling represents a cultural externalization of the same underlying informational dynamics.

IER thus unifies storytelling, instinct, and genetic “knowledge” as different realizations of a single principle: **stable informational patterns that guide systems toward viable attractors under intrinsic constraint**.

## **1. What Canonical Narratives Are**

This article uses the term **canonical narratives** in a technical sense.

Canonical narratives are:

* stable informational patterns
* that recur across cultures, contexts, and times
* and reliably organize meaning around tension, transformation, and resolution

They are **not** defined by:

* historical origin
* religious authority
* literal truth claims
* symbolic interpretation

A canonical narrative is identified by **structural invariance**, not by content.

---

## **2. Canonical Narratives Are Not Ontology**

IER maintains strict physical monism.

Canonical narratives do **not**:

* describe hidden metaphysical realms
* ground reality
* introduce non-physical entities
* require supernatural explanation

They are **informational structures instantiated within physical systems**, including brains, languages, practices, and cultures.

Their persistence reflects informational stability, not ontological depth.

---

## **3. Constraint, Experience, and Narrative Form**

IER identifies experience with **globally integrated informational dynamics under intrinsic constraint**.

Intrinsic constraint imposes:

* unavoidable demands
* non-decomposable tensions
* irreversible transitions
* identity-defining consequences

Canonical narratives reliably encode these same features:

| Experiential Constraint | Narrative Expression                    |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Intrinsic tension       | A problem that cannot be ignored        |
| Loss of slack           | Narrowing options, rising stakes        |
| Global relevance        | “Everything depends on this”            |
| Regime transition       | Crossing a threshold                    |
| Irreversibility         | No return to the prior state            |
| Stabilization           | Resolution, transformation, or collapse |

Narrative form is not arbitrary.
It mirrors the **organizational invariants of experience itself**.

## **4. Canonical Narratives as Informational Attractors**

Canonical narratives persist because they function as **informational attractors**.

They are:

* stable under retelling
* robust to reinterpretation
* resilient across media
* energetically salient to experiential systems

Their recurrence does not require transmission from a single source.

It reflects the fact that:

> **There are only limited stable ways for intrinsic constraint to organize meaning without collapse.**

Just as physical systems converge on certain attractor states, experiential systems converge on certain narrative shapes.

## **5. Externalized vs. Internalized Constraint Models**

IER distinguishes two realizations of the same informational principle:

### 5.1 Externalized Constraint Models (Storytelling)

In humans, intrinsic constraint is often **externalized** into:

* stories
* rituals
* symbols
* practices

These allow:

* weak coupling between experiential systems
* coordination without shared experience
* transmission of constraint topology without transmission of feeling

Canonical narratives belong to this category.

They do not instantiate experience.
They **model** experiential regimes.

---

### 5.2 Internalized Constraint Models (Instinct)

In biological systems, intrinsic constraint is often **internalized** via genetic inheritance.

Genes do not encode stories or behaviors directly.
They encode:

* neural architectures
* sensorimotor couplings
* affective gradients
* developmental timing constraints

Together, these specify a **pre-shaped informational phase space**.

Within that space:

* certain actions reduce intrinsic tension
* others increase it
* and specific trajectories become dynamically inevitable

---

## **6. Genetic Knowledge Without Representation**

This reframes the notion of genetic “knowledge.”

A spider does not possess:

* propositional knowledge
* symbolic narratives
* explicit goals

What it possesses is:

> **a genetically specified constraint topology that makes web construction a stable attractor of its experiential dynamics**

The spider spins a web because:

* not spinning is informationally unstable
* tension accumulates without resolution
* completion restores coherence

This is not learned.
It is not chosen.
It is **developmentally unavoidable**.

---

## **7. The Spider as a Canonical Example**

From the outside, a spider’s behavior appears mechanical.

From the inside (to the extent experience exists), it exhibits:

* rising tension
* action under constraint
* irreversible commitment
* stabilization through completion

There is no story *about* a hero.
But there **is** a hero-shaped trajectory.

The spider’s “journey” is:

* pre-symbolic
* non-representational
* fully embodied
* genetically instantiated

It is a **canonical narrative without narration**.

---

## **8. Wanting as Constraint Gradient**

The intuition that spiders “want” to spin webs is correct - but must be stated precisely.

Under IER:

> Wanting is the experiential manifestation of a gradient in intrinsic constraint.

Spinning:

* reduces tension
* stabilizes dynamics
* restores coherence

Failure to spin:

* sustains conflict
* destabilizes regulation

Thus, motivation arises not from goals, but from **constraint geometry**.

---

## **9. Why Humans Tell Stories and Spiders Do Not**

The difference is not qualitative but organizational.

Spiders:

* have tight genetic constraint
* minimal informational slack
* direct coupling from constraint to behavior

Humans:

* have excess slack
* flexible modeling capacity
* symbolic externalization

When intrinsic constraint:

* exceeds what instinct can regulate
* must coordinate across multiple experiential systems
* cannot be fully internalized genetically

 - it becomes **externalized into narrative form**.

Storytelling is what happens when constraint escapes the genome and enters culture.

## **10. Canonical Narratives and the Feeling of Truth**

Canonical narratives often feel “true” even when known to be fictional.

IER explains this precisely:

> They feel true because they accurately mirror the organization of intrinsic constraint, not because they describe external facts.

They are **organizationally correct**.

Like:

* phase diagrams
* attractor maps
* normal forms

They describe how systems behave under pressure.

---

## **11. Cultural Evolution Under Constraint**

Narratives are subject to selection.

Narratives that:

* trivialize tension
* resolve without cost
* allow easy decomposition
* misrepresent constraint

tend to decay.

Narratives that preserve constraint topology persist.

This is **informational selection**, not symbolic mysticism.

---

## **12. No Threat to Religion or Science**

IER does not challenge:

* religious meaning
* personal belief
* symbolic interpretation
* spiritual practice

It reframes narratives as **organizationally real without ontological inflation**.

They are not wrong.
They are not literal.
They are **functional models of experiential dynamics**.

---

## **13. Summary**

IER explains canonical narratives as a lawful consequence of intrinsic constraint.

> **Canonical narratives are stable informational attractors that encode how experiential systems behave when tension becomes unavoidable and identity-defining.**

They appear:

* in culture as storytelling
* in biology as instinct
* in genetics as constraint topology

Spiders spin webs.
Humans tell stories.
Both are solutions to the same problem:

**How does a system reliably find a viable attractor under intrinsic constraint?**

Reality is singular.
Experience is plural.
Meaning persists where constraint finds form.
