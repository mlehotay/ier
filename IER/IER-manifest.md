# **IER Manifest (v10.8.1)**

## **Corpus Inventory and Flat Ordering**

---

## **Status and Function**

This document enumerates the **complete corpus** of the **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** project as of **version 10.8.1**.

It defines:

* which documents are **in the corpus**
* their **flat ordering**
* their **tier classification**

It does **not** define authority, governance rules, or interpretive constraints.

> **Definitions of *corpus*, *canon*, *canonical*, *non-canonical*, and *non-corpus* are given in `IER-canon.md`.**
> This document must be read as subordinate to that canon.

---

## **Tier Definitions (Referential)**

Tier labels indicate **intended role**, not argumentative priority.

Authoritative relationships are governed by `IER-canon.md`.

* **T1 — Foundations**
  Identity claims, necessary conditions, and exclusion criteria.

* **T2 — Elaboration and Application**
  Phenomenology, ethics-in-practice, dynamics, boundaries, and structured consequences.

* **T4 — Orientation and Meta**
  Navigation, reader guidance, history, publishing, governance, and tooling.

(T3 intentionally unused.)

# **PART I — FOUNDATIONS (T1)**

**Answers:**

> *What must be true of reality for experience to exist at all?*

1. **`IER-theory.md`** — Core identity claim and exclusion criteria
2. **`IER-math.md`** — Formal structure and constraint dynamics
3. **`IER-dynamics.md`** — System evolution under intrinsic constraint
4. **`IER-diagnostics.md`** — Boundary tests and misuse detection
5. **`IER-specification.md`** — Admissibility conditions and exclusions

7. **`IER-ethics.md`** — Ethical consequences forced by the identity claim

---

# **PART II — ADDITIONAL TOPICS, APPLICATIONS, AND BOUNDARIES (T2)**

**Answers:**

> *Given that IER is true, how does it behave across phenomena, confusions, boundaries, and contexts?*

Characteristics:

* presupposes **Part I in full**
* introduces **no new foundations**
* elaborates, applies, constrains, and contextualizes
