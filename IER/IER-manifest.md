# **IER Manifest (v10.8.1 — Revised Flat Order)**

## **Corpus Inventory, Flat Ordering, and Tier Discipline**

---

## **Status and Authority**

This document defines the **official inventory of documents**, their **tier assignments**, and the **canonical flat ordering** of the
**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** corpus as of **v10.8.1**.

It introduces:

* **no ontological claims**
* **no criterial definitions**
* **no epistemic access rules**
* **no ethical principles**

All authority, constraints, and interpretive rules are defined **exclusively** in:

```
IER-canon.md
```

This manifest is **descriptive and organizational**, not normative.

---

## **Corpus Completeness**

**IER v10.8.1 constitutes a complete, closed reference corpus.**

All documents listed below are canonical.
Documents not listed here are **non-canonical by default** unless explicitly added in a future version.

---

## **Flat Order Principle (Binding)**

The corpus is presented in a **single flat order**, divided into **two conceptual parts**.

Ordering is **navigational, not inferential**.
Numbering does **not** indicate logical dependence, argumentative sequence, or priority.

---

## **Tier Discipline (Global)**

All documents are labeled with explicit tier markers:

* **[T1] Foundational Canon**
* **[T2] Canon-Constrained Analysis**
* **[T3] Misuse-Blocking / Diagnostic Limits**
* **[T4] Explanatory / Pedagogical / Meta**

Tier markers constrain interpretation and prohibit authority inflation.

# **PART I — THE IER THEORY PROPER (CLOSED ARGUMENT)**

**Answers:**

> *What does IER claim, and what necessarily follows if it is true?*

Characteristics:

* contains **all Tier-1 material**
* includes **required exclusionary and misuse-blocking constraints**
* is **normatively sufficient**
* is **closed under v10.8**
* introduces the identity claim **once and only once**
* contains **no reader-alignment or pedagogical material**

---

1. **[T1] `IER-specification.md`**
   *Exclusive normative core defining experiential identity, Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs), intrinsic constraint, categorical subjecthood, and moral standing.*

2. **[T1] `IER-theory.md`**
   *Explanatory backbone showing why experience must be a regime of global intrinsic constraint and why weaker accounts fail.*

3. **[T1] `IER-dynamics.md`**
   *Dynamics of Unified Experiential Fields: dominance, participation modulation, stability, and collapse.*

4. **[T1] `IER-math.md`**
   *Formal structural support using state spaces, regimes, and coherence without introducing diagnostics or new ontology.*

5. **[T1] `IER-slack.md`**
   *Structural impossibility argument showing why informational slack precludes experience by identity.*

6. **[T1] `IER-ethics.md`**
   *Ethical consequences that necessarily follow from experiential identity.*

7. **[T3] `IER-diagnostics.md`**
   *Canon-binding misuse-blocking document explaining why experiential diagnostics are structurally impossible and how uncertainty constrains action.*

---

> **End of Part I**
> The IER theory is fully specified, closed, and misuse-constrained at this point.

# **PART II — ADDITIONAL TOPICS, APPLICATIONS, AND BOUNDARIES**

**Answers:**

> *Given that IER is true, how does it behave across phenomena, confusions, boundaries, and contexts?*

Characteristics:

* presupposes **Part I in full**
* introduces **no new foundations**
* elaborates, applies, constrains, and contextualizes
* includes phenomenology, ethics-in-practice, boundaries, critiques, and reader materials
