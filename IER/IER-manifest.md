# **IER Manifest (v10.8.2)**

## **Corpus Inventory and Flat Ordering**

---

## **Status and Function**

This document enumerates the **complete corpus** of the
**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** project as of **version 10.8.2**.

It defines:

* which documents are **in the corpus**
* their **flat ordering**
* their **tier classification**

It does **not** define authority, governance rules, interpretive constraints, or publication behavior.

> Definitions of *corpus*, *canon*, *canonical*, *non-canonical*, and *non-corpus* are given exclusively in **`IER-canon.md`**.
> This manifest must be read as **subordinate to the canon**.

---

## **Tier Definitions (Referential)**

Tier labels indicate **intended role**, not argumentative priority.
Authority relationships are governed **exclusively** by `IER-canon.md`.

* **T1 — Foundations**
  Identity claims, necessary conditions, exclusion criteria, and normative closure.

* **T2 — Elaboration and Application**
  Phenomenology, dynamics, ethics-in-practice, boundaries, and structured consequences.

* **T3 — Misuse-Blocking / Diagnostic Limits**
  Canon-binding constraints that prohibit illegitimate inference, diagnostics, certification, or authority inflation.

* **T4 — Orientation and Meta**
  Reader guidance, navigation, history, governance, and publication context.

---

## **PART II — ADDITIONAL TOPICS, APPLICATIONS, AND BOUNDARIES**

**Answers:**

> *Given that IER is true, how does it behave across phenomena, confusions, boundaries, and contexts?*

Characteristics:

* presupposes **Part I in full**
* introduces **no new foundations**
* elaborates, applies, constrains, and contextualizes

## **Closing Statement**

This manifest defines **what counts as IER v10.8.2**.

* Authority is fixed exclusively by **`IER-canon.md`**
* Inclusion implies governance
* Governance does **not** imply reader-facing status
* Book exhaustiveness applies **only** to **Parts I–III**

> **If a document is not meant to be read by a book reader, it does not belong in the book.**
