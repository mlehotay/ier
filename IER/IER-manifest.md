## **Status and Authority**

This document defines the **official inventory of documents**, their **canon tier assignments**, and **brief descriptive summaries** for the **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** corpus as of **v10.8.1**.

It introduces **no ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical claims**.

All authority, constraints, and interpretive rules are defined **exclusively** in:

> **`IER-canon.md`**

This manifest is **descriptive**, not normative.

## **Corpus Completeness**

**IER v10.8.1 constitutes a complete reference corpus.**

All documents listed here are canonical.
Documents not listed here are **non-canonical by default** unless explicitly added in a future release.

# **Tier 1 — Foundational Canon**

**Exclusive ontological, normative, and structural authority**

---

### **Ontology and Identity**

* **`IER-specification.md`** — Exclusive normative core defining experiential identity, Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs), intrinsic constraint, categorical subjecthood, and moral standing.
* **`IER-theory.md`** — Explains why experiential identity requires global intrinsic constraint and why weaker organizational accounts fail.

---

### **Regime Structure and Formalization**

* **`IER-dynamics.md`** — Describes how UEFs behave over time, including dominance, participation modulation, stability, and collapse.
* **`IER-math.md`** — Formalizes IER using state spaces and regimes without introducing diagnostics or new ontology.

---

### **Ethical Consequences**

* **`IER-ethics.md`** — Develops the ethical consequences that necessarily follow from experiential identity.

---

# **Tier 2 — Canon-Constrained Analytical Extensions**

**Analytical and explanatory work strictly constrained by Tier-1**

---

### **Phenomenology, Continuity, and Mental Structure**

* **`IER-continuity.md`** — Explains how experiential gaps coexist with identity persistence.
* **`IER-persistence.md`** — Accounts for deep experiential change without violating categorical subjecthood.
* **`IER-brainfeels.md`** — Analyzes endogenous qualitative experiences as intrinsic-constraint stabilizers.
* **`IER-aphantasia.md`** — Interprets aphantasic phenomenology as a coherent experiential architecture.
* **`IER-emotions.md`** — Explains emotions as stable organizations of intrinsic constraint.
* **`IER-panic.md`** — Reinterprets panic and shutdown as regime-preserving or regime-abandoning responses.
* **`IER-psychosis.md`** — Describes psychosis as a pathological regime within a persisting UEF.
* **`IER-meaning.md`** — Explains meaning as a constraint-stabilizing organizational phenomenon.
* **`IER-intentionality.md`** — Replaces representational intentionality with a structural account grounded in intrinsic constraint.
* **`IER-sleep.md`** — Clarifies unconscious states using regime-based experiential continuity.
* **`IER-shadows.md`** — Explains shadow figures and DMT entities as soft attractors under extreme constraint.
* **`IER-art.md`** — Explains art and beauty as constraint-shaping experiential structures.
* **`IER-patterns.md`** — Explains recurring natural forms using attractor dynamics.
* **`IER-attractors.md`** — Introduces soft attractors in experiential organization.
* **`IER-insight.md`** — Explains insight as rapid reorganization of intrinsic constraint.
* **`IER-types.md`** — Interprets personality types as attractor-based clustering.
* **`IER-dormancy.md`** — Analyzes dormancy as an experiential null interval

### **Agency, Choice, and Action**

* **`IER-agency.md`** — Defines agency as owned resolution of intrinsic constraint within a UEF.
* **`IER-choice.md`** — Introduces Choice Spaces as structured sets of admissible futures.
* **`IER-free-will.md`** — Dissolves the free-will debate by separating determinism from ownership.
* **`IER-access.md`** — Clarifies the separation between experiential access and epistemic authority.
* **`IER-slack.md`** — Argues that informational slack structurally prevents experience under IER.
* **`IER-social-systems.md`** — Explains how institutions matter morally without being experiential subjects.
* **`IER-resolution.md`** — Distinguishes physical resolution from experiential ownership.

---

### **Normative Analysis and Critique**

* **`IER-morals.md`** — Works through concrete moral cases using IER’s distinctions.
* **`IER-denials.md`** — Explicitly lists what IER does not claim.
* **`IER-critics.md`** — Responds to major objections and clarifies accepted theoretical costs.

---

### **Comparative and Boundary Work**

* **`IER-contrast.md`** — Specifies incompatibilities between IER and neighboring theories.
* **`IER-puzzles.md`** — Shows how classic philosophical puzzles dissolve under IER.
* **`IER-dilemmas.md`** — Explains the structural misframing behind classic moral dilemmas.
* **`IER-helmets.md`** — Explains why immersive tools do not become part of a UEF.
* **`IER-gut.md`** — Explains why the enteric nervous system is not a second subject.
* **`IER-implants.md`** — Explains why neural implants reshape participation without becoming co-owners.
* **`IER-traditions.md`** — Examines major world traditions by how they influence experiential constraint.

---

# **Tier 3 — Diagnostic and Misuse-Blocking Documents**

**Canon-binding in a restrictive sense**

* **`IER-diagnostics.md`** — Explains why experiential diagnostics are structurally impossible and how uncertainty constrains action.

---

# **Tier 4 — Explanatory, Pedagogical, and Meta Material**

**No authority; full deference to higher tiers**

* **`IER-canon.md`** — Defines authority rules, alignment constraints, conflict resolution, and version discipline.
