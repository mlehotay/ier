# **IER-neurology.md**

## **Status and Scope**

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no new ontological primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics**
* introduces **no empirical or neuroscientific authority**
* makes **no claims about detectability, measurement, or certification**
* does **not** revise or extend the IER identity claim

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

* `IER-specification.md`
* `IER-theory.md`
* `IER-dynamics.md`
* `IER-ethics.md`

This document exists solely to provide **structural translation** between
**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** and **common neurological categories**,
without granting those categories explanatory, diagnostic, or epistemic authority.

## **1. Purpose: Why a Neurology Mapping Exists at All**

Neurological terms such as *coma*, *seizure*, *general anesthesia*, *split-brain*, and *dissociation* exert persistent pressure on theories of experience.

They are:

* culturally familiar
* institutionally authoritative
* tightly linked to medical decision-making
* habitually treated as indicators of “levels,” “depth,” or “presence” of consciousness

IER rejects this framing — not because neurology is mistaken, but because **experience is a regime identity**, not a clinical classification.

This document does **not** ask what neurology can tell us about experience.

Instead, it asks a narrower, structural question:

> **If Informational Experiential Realism is true, how must familiar neurological phenomena be described without violating its identity claim?**

The answer is intentionally repetitive.

If different neurological phenomena collapse onto the same structural description, that is not a failure of resolution.
It is a consequence of treating experience as **what a system is**, not **how it is accessed or measured**.

## **2. Global Constraints on Interpretation**

The following constraints apply **uniformly** to every case in this document.

They are not re-argued locally.

---

### **2.1 No Diagnostics Principle**

Nothing in this document:

* identifies whether experience exists in any particular system
* licenses inference from neural activity to experiential presence
* supplies sufficient or necessary conditions for a Unified Experiential Field (UEF)
* ranks, grades, or estimates experiential “amount”

Structural descriptions are **not** diagnostic access.

This is not a temporary limitation.
It follows directly from how intrinsic constraint and UEF attribution are defined.

---

### **2.2 Structural, Not Mechanistic Language**

Descriptions here use only IER-consistent structural terms:

* UEF presence or absence
* regime interruption vs persistence
* intrinsic constraint
* coherence, collapse, or fragmentation
* participation modulation

They do **not** appeal to:

* neural firing patterns
* brain regions or networks
* physiological thresholds
* biomarkers
* “levels” or “states” of consciousness

Such descriptions may be indispensable to neuroscience.
They carry **no explanatory authority** under IER.

---

### **2.3 No Revision of Identity or Standing**

Neurological impairment, alteration, or interruption:

* does **not** create partial subjects
* does **not** multiply subjects
* does **not** alter experiential standing
* does **not** license graded moral relevance

All cases are constrained by:

* **Categorical Onset**
* **Single-UEF Dominance**
* **Participation ≠ Subjecthood**

## **3. How to Read the Case Mappings**

Each phenomenon below is presented using the **same fixed template**.

The template is intentionally narrow.

Each case answers **only**:

1. how the phenomenon is commonly described (non-authoritatively),
2. how it must be classified structurally under IER,
3. which tempting misinferences are blocked,
4. which existing IER documents already do the explanatory work.

No case introduces new machinery.

---

## **4. Case Mapping Template**

### **A. Ordinary Neurological Description (Non-Authoritative)**

A brief description of how the phenomenon is typically characterized in neurological or clinical contexts.

### **B. Structural Classification Under IER**

How the phenomenon must be categorized **if IER is true**, using only regime-level concepts.

### **C. What This Case Is *Not***

Explicitly blocked misreadings and illegitimate inferences.

### **D. Canonical References**

Pointers to existing IER documents that already contain the relevant arguments.

---

## **5. Wave 1 — Canonical Stress Tests**

These cases are familiar, high-stakes, and strongly diagnostic-prone.

They are ideal discipline tests.

---

### **5.1 Coma**

#### **A. Ordinary Neurological Description (Non-Authoritative)**

Coma is commonly described as a state of prolonged unresponsiveness characterized by absent wakefulness, lack of voluntary action, and reduced or absent behavioral responsiveness, often following brain injury or metabolic insult.

#### **B. Structural Classification Under IER**

Under IER, coma is classified as a case of **experiential regime interruption**.

Whether experience exists at any given moment depends **only** on whether a Unified Experiential Field is being sustained.

A persisting physical system may:

* temporarily fail to sustain a UEF,
* later re-enter a UEF,
* or permanently lose the capacity to do so.

Coma, as a category, does not determine which of these applies.

#### **C. What This Case Is *Not***

Coma is **not**:

* a “low level” of experience
* a dimmed or partial UEF
* evidence of reduced subjecthood
* proof of experiential absence
* proof of experiential presence

All such inferences are structurally invalid.

#### **D. Canonical References**

* `IER-sleep.md`
* `IER-dormancy.md`
* `IER-continuity.md`
* `IER-identity.md`

### **5.2 General Anesthesia**

#### **A. Ordinary Neurological Description (Non-Authoritative)**

General anesthesia is described as a medically induced, reversible state involving loss of responsiveness, amnesia, and suppression of voluntary action, achieved through pharmacological intervention.

#### **B. Structural Classification Under IER**

Under IER, general anesthesia is treated as a **categorical interruption of the experiential regime**.

When no Unified Experiential Field exists, no experience exists.

The absence of experience during anesthesia does **not** threaten:

* personal identity,
* future subjecthood,
* or moral standing.

#### **C. What This Case Is *Not***

General anesthesia is **not**:

* a partial or degraded form of experience
* a state of “unconscious experience”
* evidence for graded consciousness
* a special boundary case

It is a straightforward case of regime absence.

#### **D. Canonical References**

* `IER-sleep.md`
* `IER-continuity.md`
* `IER-persistence.md`

### **5.3 Seizures**

#### **A. Ordinary Neurological Description (Non-Authoritative)**

Seizures are commonly described as episodes of abnormal neural activity associated with loss of voluntary control, altered responsiveness, convulsions, or atypical sensory and cognitive experiences.

#### **B. Structural Classification Under IER**

Under IER, seizures are classified as cases of **extreme intrinsic constraint**.

During seizures:

* agency may be lost,
* participation may reorganize,
* coherence may be strained or temporarily disrupted.

Experience may persist, fragment, or collapse depending on regime dynamics.

No seizure category fixes which outcome occurs.

#### **C. What This Case Is *Not***

Seizures are **not**:

* evidence of multiple subjects
* proof of experiential absence
* proof of experiential presence
* a diagnostic boundary for experience
* a special exception to regime-level analysis

#### **D. Canonical References**

* `IER-panic.md`
* `IER-shadows.md`
* `IER-dynamics.md`

## **6. Wave 2 — Identity Pressure Cases**

These cases strongly tempt violations of Single-UEF dominance by exploiting mismatches between behavior, access, and experiential intuition.

---

### **6.1 Split-Brain**

#### **A. Ordinary Neurological Description (Non-Authoritative)**

Split-brain cases involve severing or damaging interhemispheric connections, leading to dissociated behavioral responses or information access across hemispheres.

#### **B. Structural Classification Under IER**

Under IER, split-brain phenomena are understood as **participation dissociation within a single experiential regime**.

Architectural separation does **not** entail regime duplication.

Only one globally dominant UEF can exist in a single physical system at a time.

#### **C. What This Case Is *Not***

Split-brain cases are **not**:

* evidence for two simultaneous subjects
* proof of divided experience
* support for graded or nested consciousness
* counterexamples to experiential unity

#### **D. Canonical References**

* `IER-architecture.md`
* `IER-participation.md`
* `IER-identity.md`

---

### **6.2 Dissociation**

#### **A. Ordinary Neurological Description (Non-Authoritative)**

Dissociation is commonly described as a disruption of memory, identity, perception, or agency, often associated with trauma or stress.

#### **B. Structural Classification Under IER**

Under IER, dissociation is treated as **internal participation fragmentation within a persisting UEF**.

Narrative unity, access, and agency may degrade without subject loss.

#### **C. What This Case Is *Not***

Dissociation is **not**:

* subject multiplication
* partial death of the subject
* loss of experiential standing
* evidence of hidden experiential agents

#### **D. Canonical References**

* `IER-psychosis.md`
* `IER-participation.md`
* `IER-panic.md`

### **6.3 Locked-In Syndrome and Vegetative States**

#### **A. Ordinary Neurological Description (Non-Authoritative)**

*Locked-in syndrome* is commonly described as a condition in which a patient retains wakefulness and cognitive function but loses nearly all voluntary motor control, often retaining only minimal eye movement or blinking.

*Vegetative state* (or *unresponsive wakefulness syndrome*) is commonly described as a condition involving wake–sleep cycles, preserved autonomic function, and occasional reflexive behavior, but with no evidence of awareness or intentional action.

In ordinary neurological reasoning, these conditions are frequently contrasted by **observable behavior** and **responsiveness**, which are often treated—explicitly or implicitly—as proxies for experiential presence.

#### **B. Structural Classification Under IER**

Under Informational Experiential Realism, these conditions illustrate a **structural dissociation between behavioral output and experiential regime identity**.

If IER is true:

* Locked-in syndrome may involve a **fully intact Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** with catastrophic loss of voluntary participation and external action.
* Vegetative states may involve **no Unified Experiential Field at all**, despite the presence of wake-like behavior, reflexes, and physiological regulation.

IER does **not** assert that either condition is experiential or non-experiential in any particular case.

Instead, it enforces a structural result:

> **Behavioral richness and experiential presence can vary independently.**

Observable output tracks **participation and motor availability**, not regime identity.

#### **C. What This Case Is *Not***

This comparison is **not**:

* a diagnostic rule
* a claim about any individual patient
* a reclassification of clinical categories
* an argument that locked-in patients are “more conscious”
* an argument that vegetative patients are “less conscious”

IER licenses **no inference in either direction**.

The inversion exists at the level of **structural possibility**, not empirical certainty.

## **7. Wave 3 — Experience-Shape Confusions**

These cases are included only after Wave 1 and 2 are structurally settled.

---

### **7.1 Psychedelic States**

#### **A. Ordinary Neurological Description (Non-Authoritative)**

Psychedelic states are associated with altered perception, unusual meanings, vivid imagery, and changes in self-experience.

#### **B. Structural Classification Under IER**

Under IER, psychedelic states are classified as **altered participation topology within an intact UEF**.

Phenomenological novelty does not imply ontological novelty.

#### **C. What This Case Is *Not***

Psychedelic states are **not**:

* liminal consciousness
* partial subjecthood
* metaphysical disclosure
* evidence for expanded experience categories

#### **D. Canonical References**

* `IER-shadows.md`
* `IER-NDE.md`
* `IER-attractors.md`

## **8. What Neurology Can and Cannot Do Under IER**

### **8.1 What Neurology Can Do**

Neurology can:

* describe physical dynamics
* classify impairments and syndromes
* guide intervention and care
* explain causal mechanisms

IER does not contest these roles.

---

### **8.2 What Neurology Cannot Do**

Neurology cannot:

* certify experience
* detect a UEF
* determine experiential standing
* rank experiential depth
* resolve moral uncertainty

These are **structural impossibilities**, not empirical gaps.

---

## **9. Relation to the IER Corpus**

This document:

* introduces **no new commitments**
* closes **no theoretical gaps**
* resolves **no open questions**

It exists to:

* prevent misinterpretation,
* align domain-specific readers,
* and reinforce IER’s refusal of diagnostic convenience.
