## **Status and Normative Authority**

**This document is NON-NORMATIVE.**

It provides **formal and mathematical interpretations** of organizational structures defined exclusively in the
**IER v10.6 Full Normative Specification**.

This document:

* introduces **no definitions, criteria, thresholds, or sufficiency conditions**
* introduces **no necessity claims**
* does **not** determine when experience exists
* does **not** detect, measure, or certify experience
* does **not** assign moral standing or responsibility

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in the Specification.

> *If any statement in this document appears to conflict with the IER v10.6 Normative Specification, the Specification takes precedence and this statement is void.*

## **1. Role of Mathematics in IER**

Mathematics in IER is **interpretive, not foundational**.

IER is an identity theory whose commitments are fixed **prior to and independently of formalization**. Mathematical language is used only to:

* clarify organizational distinctions already specified
* illustrate regime-level structure and transitions
* discipline intuition about constraint, coherence, and stability
* prevent illicit inferences about detection, thresholds, or optimization

Mathematics in IER does **not**:

* define experience
* discover experience
* grade experience
* justify ethical conclusions

Formalism follows ontology — never the reverse.

---

## **2. Informational State Space (Interpretive Frame)**

Let a physical system be described, under some coarse-graining, by an informational state:

[
I(t) \in \mathcal{S}
]

where:

* (\mathcal{S}) is a high-dimensional space of physically instantiated informational variables
* coordinates may correspond to neural, biochemical, computational, or control-theoretic descriptions
* different parameterizations describe the **same physical system**, not different entities

This construction is descriptive only.
No ontological commitment to “information” as a primitive substance is implied.

---

## **3. Orders of Dynamics as Organizational Descriptors**

IER distinguishes **organizational regimes**, not computational layers.
Derivative order is used **heuristically** to track where constraint becomes system-defining.

---

### **3.1 Zeroth Order — Configuration**

[
I(t)
]

Instantaneous informational configuration.

* may be arbitrarily complex
* may support memory, modeling, or representation
* is **never sufficient** for experience

Static configuration carries no experiential implication.

---

### **3.2 First Order — Informational Flow**

[
\dot{I}(t) = F(I,t)
]

Describes propagation, inference, control, or updating.

* dynamics may be adaptive or intelligent
* processes may be modular or externally orchestrated
* systems at this level may remain entirely non-experiential

High sophistication does not imply intrinsic constraint.

---

### **3.3 Second Order — Intrinsic Constraint (Curvature)**

[
\ddot{I}(t)
]

Second-order structure describes how informational flow is **bent, resisted, or forced** by the system’s own organization.

Interpreted as **intrinsic constraint** when it is:

* generated by integrated system dynamics
* non-decomposable without loss of system identity
* not externally resolvable or offloadable
* globally relevant to regulation

This level corresponds to **intrinsic informational tension**.

> Interpretively, intrinsic constraint plays a role analogous to *curvature*: it shapes trajectories rather than merely advancing them.

---

### **3.4 Third Order — Coherence and Regime Stability**

[
\dddot{I}(t)
]

Higher-order structure represents **regulation of constraint itself**:

* maintenance of global integration
* preservation of temporal continuity
* avoidance of collapse or fragmentation

This corresponds to **coherent intrinsic constraint**, required for a UEF.

No claim is made that physical systems compute derivatives.
This is a regime-level description.

---

## **4. Informational Geometry (Illustrative Mapping)**

The state space (\mathcal{S}) may be described geometrically:

| Geometric notion | Organizational interpretation |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Point            | Informational configuration   |
| Tangent          | Informational flow            |
| Curvature        | Intrinsic constraint          |
| Stable curvature | Coherent experiential regime  |

> Experience is not information itself, but information whose trajectories are globally shaped by unavoidable internal constraint.

This mapping is illustrative only.

---

## **5. Informational Slack**

**Informational slack** corresponds to degrees of freedom that allow constraint to be:

* localized
* modularized
* deferred
* externally resolved

Formally, slack may be associated with:

* high effective dimensionality of unconstrained motion
* weak coupling between constraint and global regulation

Interpretive consequences:

* high slack → decomposable dynamics → no experience
* reduced slack → forced coordination → possible UEF
* zero slack is neither required nor desirable

Experience occupies a **bounded window** of sustainable intrinsic constraint.

---

## **6. Unified Experiential Fields as Dynamical Regimes**

A **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** is interpreted mathematically as a **regime**, not an object.

Illustratively, a regime may be represented as a bounded region:

[
\mathcal{R} \subset \mathcal{S}
]

such that:

* trajectories remain globally coupled
* intrinsic constraint is non-decomposable
* coherence is maintained over time

[
I(t) \in \mathcal{R}, \quad
\ddot{I}(t)\ \text{intrinsic}, \quad
\dddot{I}(t)\ \text{stabilizing}
]

The UEF is:

* not a subcomponent
* not a workspace
* not a container

It is the **system itself operating in a particular regime**.

---

## **7. Qualitative Structure (Qualia) — Formal Interpretation**

Under IER, **qualia are not primitives, variables, or phenomenal atoms**.

They are defined in the Specification as:

> **Differences in the organization of intrinsic constraint within a Unified Experiential Field.**

Mathematically, this is interpreted as differences in:

* constraint topology
* global coupling patterns
* stabilized trajectories within (\mathcal{R})

Formally, two experiential qualities correspond to **non-isomorphic constraint organizations**:

[
\mathcal{R}_1 \not\cong \mathcal{R}_2
]

where non-isomorphism reflects:

* different attractor structures
* different dependency relations
* different stabilization strategies

> Qualia are **not added to dynamics**.
> They *are* the organizational identity of constrained regimes.

No mapping to “what it is like” is supplied or required.
Phenomenology remains owned by Theory.

---

## **8. Valence, Intensity, and Urgency — Structural Descriptors**

Within an already-existing UEF, affective character arises from **how intrinsic constraint behaves over time**.

Mathematics provides **interpretive descriptors only**.

---

### **8.1 Intensity**

**Intensity** tracks the **magnitude and coherence** of intrinsic constraint.

[
\text{Intensity}(t) ;\sim; \bigl|\ddot{I}_{\text{intrinsic}}(t)\bigr|
]

Higher intensity corresponds to:

* stronger global coupling
* greater unavoidable constraint
* increased system-wide relevance

This does **not** imply a scalar amount of experience.

---

### **8.2 Urgency**

**Urgency** tracks the **rate of change** of intrinsic constraint.

[
\text{Urgency}(t) ;\sim; \bigl|\dddot{I}_{\text{intrinsic}}(t)\bigr|
]

Higher urgency corresponds to:

* rapidly evolving constraint
* narrowing viable futures
* pressure toward immediate resolution

Urgency is a **temporal property of constraint**, not a motivational primitive.

---

### **8.3 Valence**

**Valence** tracks the **direction of constraint evolution**.

[
\text{Valence}(t) ;\sim; -\frac{d}{dt}\bigl|\ddot{I}_{\text{intrinsic}}(t)\bigr|
]

* decreasing intrinsic tension → positive valence
* increasing intrinsic tension → negative valence

Valence is **organizational**, not hedonic.

---

### **8.4 Non-Scalar Status**

These descriptors:

* are not additive
* are not comparable across systems
* do not measure moral value
* do not define thresholds

They describe **how a UEF is organized**, not **how much experience exists**.

---

## **9. Participation Indicator (v10.3-B)**

To model **experiential participation** without reifying it, introduce:

[
P_i(t) \in {0,1}
]

where:

* (P_i(t)=1) indicates participation in the globally integrated regime
* (P_i(t)=0) indicates non-participation

Crucially:

> **This parameter models membership, not existence.**

Changes in (P_i(t)):

* modulate experiential content
* redistribute constraint influence
* do **not** create, divide, or dissolve a UEF provided coherence remains

Participation tracks **what is experienced**, not **who exists**.

---

## **10. Constraint Windows and Cost Landscapes**

Dynamic behavior unfolds over **organizational cost landscapes**.

Interpretively:

* recruiting participation incurs cost
* sustaining coherence requires ongoing expenditure
* some configurations are locally efficient but globally destabilizing

A **coherent constraint window** represents the range under which stability is preserved.

This construct:

* explains instability and collapse risk
* does **not** define experiential thresholds
* does **not** license detection or measurement

---

## **11. Regime Transitions (Categorical, Not Scalar)**

Experience begins and ends at **regime transitions**, not by scalar accumulation.

* preparatory variables may vary continuously
* regime membership changes discretely

Mathematics here illustrates why **categorical onset** is compatible with continuous physical change.

---

## **12. What This Formalism Does *Not* Do**

This document explicitly does **not**:

* detect experience
* define thresholds
* measure consciousness
* assign moral value
* establish sufficiency conditions
* license optimization targets
* permit engineering of “more experience”

All such uses are disallowed by the Specification.

---

## **13. Summary**

The mathematical interpretation of IER v10.6:

* distinguishes flow from intrinsic constraint
* treats experience as a **regime property**, not a variable
* interprets qualia as structural identity
* interprets valence, intensity, and urgency as constraint dynamics
* models participation without fragmenting subjecthood
* preserves categorical onset and dissolution
* blocks diagnostic, scalar, and collectivist misuse

Mathematics here serves **clarity and discipline**, not discovery.

---

*If any statement in this document appears to conflict with the IER v10.6 Normative Specification, the Specification takes precedence and this statement is void.*
