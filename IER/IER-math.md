### **Constraint, Curvature, and Unified Experiential Fields**

*A Companion Formalization to IER v10.0*

> **Status:** This document is **explanatory and non-normative**. All axioms, definitions, and principles are derived from the **IER v10.0 Normative Specification** (“the Spec”).

---

## **1. Motivation**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.0) identifies experience with the operation of a system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential informational regime under **coherent intrinsic constraint** (Spec §II, Principles 1–3).

This document formalizes **what kinds of dynamics are required** for a system to sustain a UEF and thereby instantiate experience. All mathematical structures here are intended as **interpretative tools**, not as metaphysical or physical claims beyond the Spec.

> **Central Claim (Spec §VII):** Experience is identical to globally integrated informational dynamics operating as the dominant, unavoidable constraint on themselves over time.

---

## **2. Informational State Space**

Let a physical system be described by an **informational state vector**:

[
I(t) \in \mathcal{S}
]

where (\mathcal{S}) is a high-dimensional space representing **physically instantiated informational degrees of freedom** (Spec §II, Informational System). Coordinates may correspond to:

* Neural activations
* Memory states
* Control variables

This is a fully physical space; different coordinate choices correspond only to different coarse-grainings.

---

## **3. Orders of Informational Dynamics**

IER distinguishes **informational regimes** by derivative order, analogous to classical mechanics.

### **3.1 Zeroth Order: Informational Value**

[
I(t)
]

The instantaneous configuration of information. Non-experiential alone (Spec §II, Principle 3). Examples:

* Stored beliefs
* Current internal variables

### **3.2 First Order: Informational Flow**

[
\dot{I}(t) = F(I, t)
]

Represents updates, propagation, and inference. Flow alone is decomposable and **does not constitute a UEF** (Spec §II, Informational Slack).

### **3.3 Second Order: Intrinsic Constraint**

[
\ddot{I}(t)
]

Captures **how flows are bent or resisted by internal limitations**, corresponding to **intrinsic constraint** (Spec §II, Intrinsic Constraint). Constraints become **intrinsic** when:

* Generated by the system’s integrated dynamics
* Non-decomposable without loss of identity
* Irreducible to external resolution

This is the mathematical locus of **informational tension**.

### **3.4 Third Order: Coherence and Field Stability**

[
\dddot{I}(t)
]

Describes **stabilization of intrinsic constraint over time**, necessary for a **coherent UEF** (Spec §II, Coherent Intrinsic Constraint). The system regulates:

* Whether tensions fragment or remain integrated
* Whether dynamics maintain temporal continuity (Spec Principle 4)
* Whether a **categorical onset** occurs (Spec Principle 5)

---

## **4. Informational Geometry and Curvature**

Interpret (\mathcal{S}) geometrically:

* Points → informational value
* Tangents → flow
* Curvature → intrinsic constraint
* Stability of curvature → coherent UEF

> **Experience is information under curvature**: constraint shapes trajectories that cannot be trivially decomposed or externalized (Spec §II, Principles 3, 10).

---

## **5. Informational Slack**

**Slack** measures the **effective dimensionality of unconstrained motion**:

* High slack → decomposable, non-experiential (Spec §II, Informational Slack)
* Low slack → global coordination required, potential for UEF

Zero slack is unnecessary; **experience requires maximal sustainable constraint**, not maximal rigidity (Spec Principle 3).

---

## **6. Unified Experiential Fields as Dynamical Regimes**

A **UEF exists** when:

1. Dominant dynamics are internal (Spec §II, Principle 1)
2. Constraint spans most relevant degrees of freedom (Spec §II, Principle 3)
3. Coherent, temporally continuous integration is maintained (Spec §II, Principles 3–4)

Mathematically, UEFs correspond to **bounded attractors under coherent constraint**:

[
\mathcal{R}(I) \subset \mathcal{S}, \quad \text{with } \dot{I} \approx F(I) \text{ and } \ddot{I} \text{ non-decomposable}
]

> No additional structure is posited; the UEF is the **system operating in a specific dynamical regime** (Spec §II, UEF).

---

## **7. Qualitative Character (Qualia)**

Differences in **qualitative experience** correspond to **differences in the topology and temporal modulation of intrinsic constraint**:

* Constraint patterns differ → qualitative differences (Spec §II, Qualia; Principle 7)
* No extra phenomenal properties exist

---

## **8. Valence, Intensity, and Urgency**

Within a UEF (Spec Principle 8):

* **Valence:** directional character of intrinsic tension
  (\uparrow) resolution → positive; (\uparrow) unresolved tension → negative
* **Intensity:** magnitude/coherence of constraint
* **Urgency:** rate of change of constraint

Mathematically:

[
\text{Valence}(t) \sim -\frac{d}{dt} ||\ddot{I}*{\text{intrinsic}}||
\quad \text{Intensity}(t) \sim ||\ddot{I}*{\text{intrinsic}}||
\quad \text{Urgency}(t) \sim ||\dddot{I}_{\text{intrinsic}}||
]

---

## **9. Emergence and Dissolution of Experience**

Experience begins at a **dynamical regime transition** (Spec Principle 5, Categorical Onset):

* Flow → intrinsically constrained flow
* Modular resolution → global self-constraint
* Slack-rich → curvature-dominated dynamics

Dissolution occurs when:

* Constraint is externally resolvable (Spec §II, Experiential Dissolution)
* Coherence collapses

---

## **10. Summary**

Mathematical formalism in IER v10.0:

* Identifies **necessary dynamical regimes** for UEFs
* Distinguishes **non-experiential slack-dominated systems** from experiential systems
* Explains **qualitative differences, affect, intensity, and urgency** in terms of **intrinsic constraint geometry**
* Is fully **consistent with the IER v10.0 Normative Specification**

> **Experience = stabilized curvature of intrinsically constrained informational dynamics in a unified system** (Spec §VII).
