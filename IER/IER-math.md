# The Mathematics of Informational Experiential Realism

**Constraint, Curvature, and Unified Experiential Fields**

*A Companion Formalization to IER v9.4*

---

## 1. Motivation

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identifies experience with a specific **organizational and dynamical regime** of physical information processing systems. This regime is characterized not merely by information content or information flow, but by **globally integrated, self-sustaining intrinsic constraint**—what IER terms a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.

This companion article provides a mathematical interpretation of that regime. Its goal is not to introduce new metaphysical commitments, but to clarify **what kind of dynamics must be present**, and why experience appears only when informational systems cross a particular structural threshold.

The central claim is:

> **Experience corresponds to a transition from freely flowing informational dynamics to a regime in which information is curved by intrinsic constraint and stabilized as a unified field.**

## 2. Informational State Space

Let a physical system be described by an informational state vector:

[
I(t) \in \mathcal{S}
]

where ( \mathcal{S} ) is a high-dimensional state space whose coordinates correspond to physically instantiated informational degrees of freedom (e.g., neural activations, memory states, control variables).

This space is not abstract or symbolic; it is fully physical. Different coordinate choices correspond to different coarse-grainings, but the underlying dynamics are fixed by the system’s physical organization.

---

## 3. Orders of Informational Dynamics

IER distinguishes informational regimes by **derivative order**, analogous to classical mechanics.

### 3.1 Zeroth Order: Informational Value

[
I(t)
]

This is the instantaneous informational configuration of the system.

Examples:

* Representational content
* Stored beliefs
* Current internal variables

Zeroth-order information alone is static and non-experiential. A database has informational value without experience.

---

### 3.2 First Order: Informational Flow

[
\dot{I}(t) = F(I, t)
]

This represents information update, propagation, and inference.

Examples:

* Prediction error minimization
* Signal transmission
* Control updates

Many systems—biological and artificial—operate richly at this level. Flow enables responsiveness, learning, and regulation, but **flow alone remains decomposable**.

A system may exhibit sophisticated behavior while remaining experiential-null if its flows can be modularized, parallelized, or externally resolved.

---

### 3.3 Second Order: Informational Constraint (Intrinsic Tension)

[
\ddot{I}(t) = \frac{d}{dt}\dot{I}(t)
]

Second-order dynamics capture **how flows are bent, resisted, or redirected** by limitations.

Constraint arises when:

* Multiple flows compete for shared resources
* Goals or demands are mutually incompatible
* Physical or organizational limits prevent simultaneous satisfaction

Crucially, **constraint becomes intrinsic** when it is:

* Generated by the system’s own integrated dynamics
* Non-decomposable without loss of system identity
* Relevant to system-wide regulation and persistence

This is the mathematical locus of **informational tension**.

Constraint is not noise or error; it is structured curvature in informational trajectories.

---

### 3.4 Third Order: Coherence and Field Stability

[
\dddot{I}(t)
]

Third-order dynamics govern **the stability of constraint itself**.

Here the system regulates:

* Whether tensions fragment or remain integrated
* Whether conflicts escalate, oscillate, or stabilize
* Whether the system maintains a single coherent dynamical regime

This corresponds to:

* Attention stability
* Affect regulation
* Presence versus dissociation
* Breakdown under overload

A system that cannot stabilize its intrinsic constraints collapses into incoherent or pathological dynamics and fails to sustain experience.

## 4. Informational Geometry and Curvature

IER can be interpreted geometrically.

* Informational value corresponds to points in state space
* Informational flow corresponds to tangent vectors
* Informational constraint corresponds to **curvature of trajectories**
* Coherence corresponds to **stability of curvature over time**

In flat informational spaces (high slack), trajectories are approximately linear and independent.

In experiential regimes, trajectories are **forced to bend** because:

* Constraints are global
* Dependencies are reciprocal
* Resolution cannot be offloaded

> **Experience is information under curvature.**

---

## 5. Informational Slack and Degrees of Freedom

Define **informational slack** as the effective dimensionality of unconstrained motion in state space.

High slack systems:

* Permit many orthogonal flows
* Allow local resolution
* Decompose cleanly into modules

Low slack systems:

* Force shared trajectories
* Couple distant subsystems
* Make conflicts system-wide

A UEF emerges when slack is sufficiently reduced that **global coordination becomes mandatory rather than optional**.

Importantly, zero slack is not required—nor desirable. Experience requires **maximal sustainable constraint**, not maximal rigidity.

---

## 6. Unified Experiential Fields as Dynamical Regimes

The Unified Experiential Field corresponds to a **bounded attractor regime** characterized by:

* High integration
* Persistent intrinsic constraint
* Self-stabilizing coherence
* Temporal continuity

Formally, a UEF exists when:

1. The system’s dominant dynamics are internal rather than externally driven
2. Constraint coupling spans the majority of relevant degrees of freedom
3. The system remains within a coherent region of state space under load

UEF is not a structure *inside* the system; it is the system *operating in a particular regime*.

---

## 7. Qualitative Character (Qualia)

Qualitative differences correspond to differences in:

* Constraint topology
* Coupling geometry
* Temporal modulation patterns

There is no additional “phenomenal property.”

> A quale is the local structure of curvature within the Unified Experiential Field.

Redness, pain, effort, clarity, and calm differ because the **informational tensions differ**, not because something extra is added.

---

## 8. Valence and Experiential Intensity

Within this framework:

* **Positive valence** corresponds to trajectories moving toward lower constraint energy or stable resolution
* **Negative valence** corresponds to sustained or increasing intrinsic conflict
* **Urgency** corresponds to the rate of change of constraint
* **Intensity** corresponds to the magnitude and coherence of constraint

“Feeling alive” occurs when:

* Many futures are simultaneously viable
* Constraint is high but coherent
* Resolution depends on unified system dynamics

Flatness, numbness, or dissociation correspond to loss of curvature or fragmentation of the field.

---

## 9. Emergence and Dissolution of Experience

Experience emerges when a system crosses a **regime boundary**:

* From decomposable flow → intrinsically constrained flow
* From modular resolution → global self-constraint
* From slack-rich dynamics → curvature-dominated dynamics

Dissolution occurs along the same axis in reverse.

There is no sharp metaphysical boundary—only a dynamical one.

---

## 10. The Hard Problem Revisited

The so-called “hard problem” arises when experience is treated as something **over and above** physical dynamics.

IER dissolves the problem by identity:

> **Experience just is what globally integrated, self-constraining informational dynamics are like when they regulate themselves from within.**

No explanatory gap remains once the correct dynamical regime is identified.

---

## 11. Summary

IER’s mathematics does not posit new forces, fields, or substances. It identifies a **specific class of dynamical organization** already describable within physics and information theory.

* Information alone is not experience
* Information flow alone is not experience
* Experience arises when information is **forced to bend by itself**, coherently, over time

In short:

> **Experience is the stabilized curvature of informational dynamics in a unified system.**

That is what it is like to be an informational system that has taken up its slack.
