## **Status and Normative Authority**

**This document is NON-NORMATIVE.**

It provides **interpretive and formal clarification** of organizational structures defined **exclusively** in the
**IER v10.6 Normative Specification**.

This document:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or sufficiency conditions**
* introduces **no necessity claims**
* does **not** define experience
* does **not** detect or measure experience
* does **not** ground agency or moral standing

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in the Specification.

> *If any statement in this document appears to conflict with the Specification, the Specification takes precedence and this statement is void.*

## **1. Role of Mathematics in IER**

Mathematics in IER is **interpretive, not foundational**.

IER is an **identity theory** whose commitments are fixed **prior to and independently of formalization**. Mathematical language is used only to:

* clarify distinctions already present in the ontology
* describe regime-level organization
* stabilize intuition about constraint, coherence, and change
* prevent illicit inferences about detection, thresholds, or optimization

Mathematics in IER does **not**:

* define experience
* discover experience
* grade experience
* provide diagnostics
* justify ethical conclusions
* imply computational or graph-theoretic fundamentalism

Formal structure follows ontology — **never the reverse**.

---

## **2. Informational State Space (Interpretive Frame)**

Let a physical system be described, under some coarse-graining, by an informational state:

$$
I(t) \in \mathcal{S}
$$

where:

* $\mathcal{S}$ is a high-dimensional space of physically instantiated informational variables
* coordinates may correspond to neural, biochemical, mechanical, or control-theoretic descriptions
* different parameterizations describe the **same physical system**, not different entities

This construction is **descriptive only**.

IER makes **no ontological commitment** to information as a substance or primitive.

---

## **3. Orders of Description**

IER distinguishes **orders of description** to track where constraint becomes system-defining. These are **organizational descriptors**, not computational layers.

---

### **3.1 Zeroth Order — Configuration**

$$
I(t)
$$

Instantaneous informational configuration.

* may be arbitrarily complex
* may support memory, modeling, or representation
* is **never sufficient** for experience or agency

Static configuration alone carries no experiential or agential implication.

---

### **3.2 First Order — Informational Flow**

$$
\dot{I}(t)
$$

Describes lawful evolution of informational state.

* may be deterministic or stochastic
* may be adaptive or intelligent
* may remain entirely non-experiential

Flow describes **what happens**, not what is *owned*.

---

### **3.3 Second Order — Intrinsic Constraint**

$$
\ddot{I}(t)
$$

Second-order structure describes how informational flow is **bent, resisted, or forced** by the system’s own organization.

Interpreted as **intrinsic constraint** when it is:

* generated by the system itself
* non-decomposable without loss of system identity
* not externally resolvable or offloadable
* globally relevant to regulation

This corresponds to **intrinsic informational tension**.

---

### **3.4 Mid-Order — Choice Spaces and Constraint Graphs**

Between intrinsic constraint and full agency lies a **derived mid-order structure**: the **choice space**.

A **choice space** is the structured set of admissible future states and transitions generated by intrinsic constraint.

Interpretively, a choice space may be represented as a **directed constraint graph**:

* **nodes** correspond to informational states the system could occupy
* **directed edges** correspond to admissible transitions under constraint
* the graph represents **what could happen**, not what will

This structure:

* is **derived from intrinsic constraint**
* exists **prior to agency**
* supports counterfactuals and history dependence
* accumulates structural narrowing over time

The constraint graph is:

* not a belief space
* not a decision rule
* not an optimization structure
* not ontologically fundamental

It is an **informational object** that may or may not be owned.

When such a structure is globally integrated within a Unified Experiential Field, traversal may constitute **choice**. Without such integration, it remains **pre-agential**.

This level of description may be informally regarded as a “2.5th order” of organization.

---

### **3.5 Third Order — Coherence and Regime Stability**

$$
\dddot{I}(t)
$$

Higher-order structure describes regulation of constraint itself:

* maintenance of global integration
* preservation of temporal continuity
* avoidance of collapse or fragmentation

This corresponds to **coherent intrinsic constraint**, required for a Unified Experiential Field.

---

## **4. Regimes and Trajectories**

A **dynamical regime** is a bounded region of state space in which:

* trajectories remain globally coupled
* intrinsic constraint is unavoidable
* coherence is maintained over time

A **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** corresponds to such a regime.

Choice spaces exist **within** regimes but are **not themselves regimes**.

---

## **5. Traversal, Collapse, and Ownership (Interpretive)**

Traversal of a constraint graph corresponds to realization of a trajectory.

Traversal alone does **not** constitute choice.

**Ownership** arises only when:

* unrealized alternatives remain relevant to ongoing dynamics
* collapse of alternatives constrains the system’s future *from the inside*
* constraint is globally integrated and temporally continuous

Ownership is a **regime-level property**, not a feature of individual transitions.

---

## **6. Narrative Structure**

A realized path through a constraint graph corresponds to a **narrative trajectory**.

* past: traversed path
* present: current node
* future: remaining reachable subgraph

Narrative structure arises from **owned traversal**, not from representational storytelling.

---

## **7. Relation to Agency**

IER defines **agency** as the capacity of a Unified Experiential Field to resolve intrinsic informational tension through its own globally integrated dynamics.

Mathematically interpreted:

* agency operates **on** choice spaces
* agency resolves constraint by collapsing admissible futures
* degree of agency tracks stability and ownership of traversal

Choice presupposes agency but is not identical to it.

---

## **8. Determinism, Randomness, and Lawfulness**

The structures described here are **neutral** with respect to:

* determinism
* indeterminism
* stochasticity

Randomness may produce branching in a constraint graph, but **cannot by itself produce ownership**.

Deterministic dynamics may fully support owned traversal.

No appeal to metaphysical freedom is required.

---

## **9. What This Formalism Does *Not* Do**

This document explicitly does **not**:

* define experience
* detect or measure experience
* define agency or responsibility
* provide decision procedures
* imply optimization targets
* commit to computational or graph-theoretic fundamentalism

All such uses are out of scope.

---

## **10. Summary**

The mathematical interpretation of IER v10.6:

* distinguishes configuration, flow, constraint, and coherence
* identifies a derived **mid-order choice space**
* represents choice spaces as **constraint graphs**
* treats choice as **owned traversal**, not branching
* explains narrative as realized path
* preserves compatibility with determinism
* blocks libertarian and eliminativist errors simultaneously

> **Experience is a regime.
> Choice is the owned collapse of structured possibility within that regime.**
