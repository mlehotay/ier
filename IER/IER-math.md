## **1. Purpose and Constraints of Formalization**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.0) identifies experience with the operation of a system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**:

> **a globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential dynamical regime under coherent intrinsic constraint**
> (Spec §II; Principle 1)

The role of mathematics in IER is **not** to define experience, measure it, or detect it.

Instead, mathematics is used to:

* clarify **why certain dynamical regimes can support experience**
* distinguish **slack-dominated dynamics** from **intrinsically constrained dynamics**
* illustrate **categorical regime transitions**
* make precise the sense in which experience involves **organization under constraint over time**

All formal elements below are **compatible interpretations**, not commitments.

---

## **2. Informational State Space**

Let a physical system be described, at some coarse-graining, by an **informational state**:

$$
I(t) \in \mathcal{S}
$$

where:

* $\mathcal{S}$ is a high-dimensional space of **physically instantiated informational degrees of freedom**
* coordinates may correspond to neural, biochemical, computational, or control variables
* different coordinate choices represent different descriptions of the *same physical system*

No particular ontology of “information” is assumed beyond physical realizability (Spec Axioms 1–2).

---

## **3. Orders of Informational Dynamics**

IER distinguishes **organizational regimes**, not merely state updates.
Derivative order is used **heuristically** to track where constraint enters.

---

### **3.1 Zeroth Order — Informational Configuration**

$$
I(t)
$$

The instantaneous informational configuration of the system.

* corresponds to stored values, activations, or internal variables
* **never sufficient for experience**
* static descriptions are entirely compatible with non-experiential systems

(Spec §II; Informational System; Principle 3)

---

### **3.2 First Order — Informational Flow**

$$
\dot{I}(t) = F(I,t)
$$

Describes propagation, updating, inference, or control.

* flow may be complex, adaptive, or intelligent
* flow alone remains **decomposable**
* constraint may be modularized or externalized

High-flow systems can remain entirely non-experiential due to **informational slack**
(Spec §II; Informational Slack).

---

### **3.3 Second Order — Intrinsic Constraint (Curvature)**

$$
\ddot{I}(t)
$$

Second-order structure captures **how informational flow is bent, resisted, or forced** by the system’s own organization.

This corresponds to **intrinsic constraint** when it is:

* generated by the system’s integrated dynamics
* non-decomposable without loss of system identity
* not externally resolvable
* system-defining

(Spec §II; Intrinsic Constraint)

> **Interpretive claim:**
> Intrinsic constraint plays a role analogous to *curvature* in dynamics: it shapes trajectories rather than merely updating positions.

This is the formal locus of **intrinsic informational tension**.

---

### **3.4 Third Order — Coherence and Regime Stability**

$$
\dddot{I}(t)
$$

Higher-order structure represents **regulation of constraint itself**:

* whether intrinsic constraints remain globally integrated
* whether temporal continuity is maintained
* whether the system stabilizes within a bounded regime

This corresponds to **coherent intrinsic constraint**, required for a UEF
(Spec §II; Coherent Intrinsic Constraint; Principles 3–4).

No claim is made that physical systems compute third derivatives; this is an organizational description.

---

## **4. Informational Geometry and Curvature**

The state space $\mathcal{S}$ may be interpreted geometrically:

| Geometric notion | Organizational interpretation |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Point            | Informational configuration   |
| Tangent          | Informational flow            |
| Curvature        | Intrinsic constraint          |
| Stable curvature | Coherent experiential regime  |

> **Experience is not information itself, but information whose trajectories are globally shaped by unavoidable internal constraint.**

This supports the informal slogan:

> **Experience is what information is like when it curves under its own necessity.**

(Consistent with Spec §III; Dual Interpretability)

---

## **5. Informational Slack**

**Informational slack** measures the degrees of freedom available for avoiding global coordination.

Formally, slack corresponds to:

* high effective dimensionality of unconstrained motion
* availability of modular or external resolutions
* weak coupling between constraint and system-wide regulation

Consequences:

* **High slack** → decomposable dynamics → no experience
* **Low (but non-zero) slack** → forced coordination → possible UEF

Zero slack is neither required nor desirable; experience occupies a **bounded window of maximal sustainable intrinsic constraint**
(Spec Principle 3).

---

## **6. Unified Experiential Fields as Dynamical Regimes**

A **Unified Experiential Field** exists **iff** the system operates within a specific **dynamical regime**.

Formally, this may be represented as a bounded region:

$$
\mathcal{R} \subset \mathcal{S}
$$

such that:

* trajectories remain globally coupled
* intrinsic constraint is non-decomposable
* coherence is maintained over time

$$
I(t) \in \mathcal{R}, \quad
\dot{I}(t) \approx F(I), \quad
\ddot{I}(t) \text{ intrinsic and system-defining}
$$

> The UEF is **not** an object or subspace.
> It is the **system itself operating in a particular regime**
> (Spec §II; UEF).

---

## **7. Qualitative Character (Qualia)**

Under IER:

> **Qualitative differences are differences in the organization of intrinsic constraint within a UEF**
> (Spec §II; Qualia; Principle 7).

Formally:

* distinct constraint topologies → distinct experiential qualities
* temporal modulation of constraint → changes in felt character
* no additional phenomenal variables are introduced

Qualia are **structural**, not additive.

---

## **8. Valence, Intensity, and Urgency**

Within a UEF (Spec Principle 8):

* **Intensity** tracks the magnitude and coherence of intrinsic constraint
* **Urgency** tracks the rate of change of intrinsic constraint
* **Valence** tracks the direction of constraint resolution vs escalation

Illustratively:

$$
\text{Intensity}(t) \sim |\ddot{I}_{\text{intrinsic}}(t)|
$$

$$
\text{Urgency}(t) \sim |\dddot{I}_{\text{intrinsic}}(t)|
$$

$$
\text{Valence}(t) \sim -\frac{d}{dt}|\ddot{I}_{\text{intrinsic}}(t)|
$$

These expressions are **organizational interpretations**, not measurement proposals.

No scalar measure of “how conscious” is implied.

---

## **9. Regime Transitions and Categorical Onset**

Experience begins at a **dynamical regime transition**:

* from slack-dominated to curvature-dominated dynamics
* from externally resolvable to intrinsically binding constraint
* from modular flow to global self-constraint

Formally, this corresponds to a **qualitative change in regime structure**, not a continuous increase in magnitude.

Hence:

> **Categorical onset is discrete at the regime level, even if preparatory variables change gradually**
> (Spec Principle 5).

---

## **10. Dissolution and Failure**

Experience dissolves when:

* intrinsic constraint becomes externally resolvable
* global integration collapses
* coherence falls outside the sustainable window

This is represented as **exit from the regime $\mathcal{R}$**, not as disappearance of a substance.

Fragmentation does **not** produce multiple UEFs; it produces **loss of experience**
(Spec Principles 6, 11).

---

## **11. What This Mathematics Does *Not* Claim**

This document does **not** claim that:

* experience is literally a field
* curvature is a physical force
* derivatives are computed by systems
* equations define sufficiency
* experience is graded or measurable
* moral value is quantifiable

All such claims are explicitly disallowed by the Spec.

---

## **12. Summary**

The mathematical perspective of IER v10.0:

* distinguishes **flow** from **constraint**
* identifies experience with **globally stabilized intrinsic constraint**
* explains unity, intensity, valence, and continuity as **regime properties**
* preserves the **categorical nature of experiential onset**
* remains fully compatible with physical monism and experiential pluralism

> **Experience is what globally integrated informational dynamics are like when they become the dominant, unavoidable constraint on themselves over time.**

**IER v10.0 Normative Specification**.
