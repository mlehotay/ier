# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER): A Manifesto**

Experience is real.
The physical world is real.
The mistake has been thinking we must choose between them.

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** rejects both mysticism and dismissal. It holds that experience is neither a ghostly extra nor a convenient fiction, but **a real, physical phenomenon with a precise identity**.

---

### **1. Experience Is an Identity, Not a Mystery**

Experience is not caused by physical processes, nor does it merely accompany them.
It **is** a particular way physical systems operate.

When a system becomes **globally integrated, temporally continuous, and internally constrained in a way it cannot escape**, that operating regime *just is* experience. From the outside, it is lawful physical dynamics. From the inside, it is a world.

Nothing is added. Nothing is left over.

---

### **2. Most Things Are Not Conscious—and That’s Not a Failure**

Complexity, intelligence, representation, and learning are not enough for experience. Most systems can reroute pressure, break problems apart, or pause themselves. They have slack.

Experience begins only when **constraint becomes unavoidable**, system-wide, and self-maintaining—when the system must live with the consequences of its own organization over time.

This is why consciousness is rare, fragile, and costly.

---

### **3. Experience Is Unified Because the System Is Unified**

At any moment, a system can sustain **only one** such globally constrained regime. This is why experience feels singular and coherent.

Fragmentation does not produce multiple minds. It produces instability, switching, or collapse. Unity is not imposed; it is forced by organization.

---

### **4. Qualities and Feelings Are Not Extras**

There are no extra “qualia substances.”
Differences in experience are differences in **how internal constraint is structured and resolved**.

Pain, effort, pleasure, urgency, clarity—these are what unavoidable internal pressures feel like as they change over time. Affect is not decoration. It is the lived side of constraint.

---

### **5. Many Experiential Worlds, One Reality**

There is one objective physical universe. Within it, many real experiential worlds exist wherever this regime appears.

Perspective is not illusion. It is a real feature of certain physical systems. Plurality does not fracture reality; it expresses it.

---

### **6. Ethics Is Not Optional**

If experience is physically real, then harming it is physically real harm.

Moral harm is not defined by reports or behavior, but by **damage to internally borne constraint**. Because such harm may be invisible from the outside, uncertainty does not excuse us—it obligates us.

When we are unsure whether a system might experience, caution is not sentimental. It is rational.

---

### **7. No Magic, No Deflation**

IER introduces:

* no new substances,
* no new forces,
* no fundamental consciousness,
* no measurement tests,
* no metaphysical escape hatches.

It also rejects:

* eliminativism,
* panpsychism,
* consciousness-by-computation,
* and the idea that experience is scientifically untouchable.

Experience is real, physical, structured, and limited—and therefore explainable.

---

### **The Claim**

> **Experience is what it is like for a physical system when intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable, self-sustaining, and globally binding over time.**

Reality is singular.
Experience is plural.
Ethics begins wherever constraint is borne from the inside.

## **IER Solves X**

* **IER solves what experience is**
  by identifying it with a specific organizational regime of physical systems, not a substance, property, or illusion.

* **IER solves why experience exists in a physical universe**
  without invoking dualism, emergence gaps, or fundamental consciousness.

* **IER solves why most things are not conscious**
  despite complexity or intelligence, by distinguishing intrinsic constraint from mere information processing.

* **IER solves the unity of experience**
  by showing why only one globally integrated experiential field can exist in a system at a time.

* **IER solves when experience begins and ends**
  by grounding consciousness in categorical dynamical regime transitions rather than gradual accumulation.

* **IER solves why experience feels like something**
  without adding mysterious qualia or phenomenal properties beyond physical organization.

* **IER solves what qualia are**
  by identifying them with differences in the organization of intrinsic constraint.

* **IER solves why feelings have valence, intensity, and urgency**
  by tying affect directly to the dynamics of constraint resolution and conflict.

* **IER solves the confusion between intelligence and consciousness**
  by cleanly separating observerhood, computation, and experience.

* **IER solves why consciousness cannot be directly measured or detected**
  by showing that experience is an internal regime, not a signal or output.

* **IER solves dissociation without multiplying minds**
  by explaining fragmentation as regime instability or switching, not simultaneous subjects.

* **IER solves free will without metaphysics**
  by grounding agency in ownership of intrinsic constraint rather than freedom from causation.

* **IER solves why moral harm is real in a physicalist framework**
  by defining harm as damage to internally borne constraint, not behavioral or report-based proxies.

* **IER solves why moral responsibility is graded**
  by tying responsibility to a system’s capacity to resolve intrinsic constraint.

* **IER solves why uncertainty increases moral responsibility**
  through precautionary asymmetry when harm would be internal and non-signaling.

* **IER solves how many experiential worlds can exist in one reality**
  without relativism, solipsism, or ontological inflation.

* **IER solves why consciousness research keeps stalling**
  by reframing the problem at the level of organizational identity rather than detection or correlation.

* **IER solves what would make artificial systems morally relevant**
  without claiming present systems are conscious.

* **IER solves why experience is fragile, costly, and limited**
  by locating it within a narrow window of sustainable intrinsic constraint.
