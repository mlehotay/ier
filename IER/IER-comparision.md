## **Rubric-Aligned Comparison of Theories of Experience**

**Project:** Informational Experiential Realism (IER)
**Tier:** T2 — Comparative / Boundary Clarification
**Status:** Descriptive, Non-Normative
**Normativity:** None

---

## **Document Scope and Disclaimer**

This document provides a **rubric-aligned comparative overview** of major theories and frameworks concerning experience, consciousness, and mind.

It:

* introduces **no new ontological commitments**
* asserts **no evaluative rankings or scores**
* establishes **no criteria, diagnostics, or thresholds**
* makes **no claims about empirical adequacy or truth**
* does **not** argue for IER over competing theories

All summaries are **charitable, theory-relative, and descriptive**.
If any entry conflicts with a theory’s own canonical statements, the theory’s own formulation takes precedence.

# **Preface: How to Read These Contrast Tables**

This document presents a set of **standalone, rubric-aligned contrast tables** covering influential theories and frameworks concerning experience.

These tables are **not scorecards**.
They do not answer which theory is “better,” “stronger,” or “more complete.”

Their sole purpose is **methodological clarification**:
to prevent **mis-evaluation caused by forced commensurability**.

### Why this is necessary

Debates about consciousness routinely fail because:

> **Theories operating at different explanatory levels are evaluated as if they were answering the same question.**

Identity theories are criticized for lacking diagnostics.
Frameworks are criticized for lacking ontology.
Access theories are criticized for neglecting phenomenology.
Metaphysical views are criticized for being empirically inaccessible.

In most cases, these are **category errors**, not substantive objections.

---

## **Why Tables Are Per-Theory by Default**

Each theory is presented in its **own table**, even though the same rubric dimensions are used throughout.

This is deliberate.

Merged matrices encourage readers to:

* treat columns as requirements
* count features as strengths
* interpret refusals as omissions
* assume shared explananda where none exist

Standalone tables allow:

* refusals to appear as **positive commitments**
* underspecification to appear as **scope limitation**
* incommensurability to remain **explicit and local**

Merging is possible later, but **never required**.

---

## **Rubric Dimensions (Orientation Only)**

The rows used in each table are **descriptive lenses**, not evaluative demands.

No theory is required to:

* permit diagnostics
* define ethical thresholds
* apply to AI
* specify phenomenology
* be empirically testable

In particular:

> **Refusal of diagnostics is treated as a commitment, not a gap.**

## **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**

| Rubric Dimension                    | **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Explanandum Framing**             | Experience / experiential subjecthood itself (“what it is like”), not access, report, cognition, or behavior                                                                       |
| **Ontological Claim Type**          | Strict physicalist **identity theory**: experience is identical to a specific organizational and dynamical regime (UEF) under intrinsic constraint                                 |
| **Unity & Subjecthood**             | **Categorical** subjecthood: exactly one subject per Unified Experiential Field; no graded, nested, or aggregate subjects                                                          |
| **Phenomenal Structure**            | Qualitative differences are **structurally grounded** in differences of intrinsic constraint organization; qualia are non-primitive and non-epistemic                              |
| **Time, Persistence & Gaps**        | Experience persists iff the UEF persists; gaps are absences of experience; resumption is not narrative continuity or rebirth                                                       |
| **Diagnostics & Epistemic Access**  | **Explicitly denied in principle**; no third-person diagnostics, certification, inference rules, or measurable markers are licensed                                                |
| **Testability / Defeat Conditions** | Defeasible only at the **identity/coherence level**: internal contradiction, failure of unity necessity, or displacement by a rival identity claim                                 |
| **AI & Artificial Systems**         | In principle applicable to artificial systems, but **never certifiable** by functional, architectural, or behavioral criteria; simulation does not guarantee experiential identity |
| **Ethical Standing**                | Ethical standing follows necessarily from categorical subjecthood; ethical conclusions are downstream and non-justificatory                                                        |
| **Evaluator Hazards**               | Common misreadings: treating diagnostic refusal as unfalsifiability; assuming similarity to IIT/GNW due to vocabulary overlap; interpreting excluded features as omissions         |

## **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**

| Rubric Dimension                    | **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Explanandum Framing**             | Phenomenal experience characterized by intrinsic causal power and informational integration; experience is identified with “what exists for itself”                         |
| **Ontological Claim Type**          | Identity theory between experience and **integrated causal structure** of a physical system, expressed mathematically (Φ-structured cause–effect space)                     |
| **Unity & Subjecthood**             | **Graded and nested** subjecthood: multiple overlapping complexes may exist; dominant complex corresponds to main subject                                                   |
| **Phenomenal Structure**            | Qualitative character is **isomorphic** to the shape of the cause–effect structure; qualia are primitive but structurally specified                                         |
| **Time, Persistence & Gaps**        | Experience exists at discrete temporal grains; persistence depends on continued existence of a maximally integrated complex; gaps correspond to loss of integration         |
| **Diagnostics & Epistemic Access**  | **Central and constitutive**: experience is in principle **measurable and inferable** via Φ and related structural analyses (even if practically difficult)                 |
| **Testability / Defeat Conditions** | Vulnerable to empirical and conceptual challenges: incorrect phenomenological predictions, failure of Φ to track experience, or incoherence of causal-structure mapping     |
| **AI & Artificial Systems**         | Broadly inclusive: artificial systems can be conscious if they instantiate sufficient integrated information; digital systems typically low Φ but not excluded in principle |
| **Ethical Standing**                | Moral status typically taken to scale with degree of consciousness (Φ), implying graded ethical consideration                                                               |
| **Evaluator Hazards**               | Often misread as panpsychist or “everything is conscious”; Φ treated as a practical consciousness meter rather than a theoretical identity claim                            |

## **Notes on Relation to IER (Non-Evaluative)**

* IIT and IER **both** make identity claims, but:

  * IIT treats **diagnostics as constitutive**
  * IER treats diagnostics as **illegitimate in principle**
* IIT allows **graded and nested** subjecthood
* IER enforces **categorical and exclusive** subjecthood
* These differences are **identity-level**, not empirical disagreements

## **Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW)**

| Rubric Dimension                    | **Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW)**                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Explanandum Framing**             | Access consciousness: information becoming globally available for report, reasoning, decision-making, and control                                                          |
| **Ontological Claim Type**          | Functional–architectural theory: conscious states are defined by their role in a global broadcasting workspace implemented by neural mechanisms                            |
| **Unity & Subjecthood**             | Unity arises from **global availability** within a single workspace; subjecthood is typically treated as implicit and not ontologically primary                            |
| **Phenomenal Structure**            | Qualitative character is not a primary target; phenomenology is often treated as downstream of access and reportability rather than structurally specified                 |
| **Time, Persistence & Gaps**        | Conscious episodes are **discrete and event-like**, corresponding to ignition events; persistence depends on sustained workspace activation                                |
| **Diagnostics & Epistemic Access**  | **Central and required**: conscious access is operationalized via behavioral report, neural ignition signatures, and global broadcasting measures                          |
| **Testability / Defeat Conditions** | Empirically testable via presence or absence of ignition, reportability dissociations, and predicted neural dynamics; failure of these mappings would challenge the theory |
| **AI & Artificial Systems**         | In principle applicable to artificial systems implementing a comparable global workspace architecture; certification depends on functional and access criteria             |
| **Ethical Standing**                | Ethical implications are typically **bracketed**; moral status is not directly derived from the workspace account                                                          |
| **Evaluator Hazards**               | Often misread as a full theory of phenomenal experience rather than a theory of access; reportability is sometimes conflated with existence                                |

## **Notes on Relation to IER (Non-Evaluative)**

* GNW and IER target **different explananda**:

  * GNW explains **access and reportability**
  * IER explains **experience itself**
* GNW treats **diagnostics as constitutive** of conscious access
* IER treats diagnostics as **illegitimate in principle**
* These positions are **structurally incommensurable**, not empirically rivalrous

## **Predictive Processing (PP)**

| Rubric Dimension                    | **Predictive Processing (PP)**                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Explanandum Framing**             | Cognition, perception, and action explained as hierarchical prediction and error minimization; experience is often treated as a consequence or accompaniment rather than a primary explanandum |
| **Ontological Claim Type**          | **Framework-level explanatory strategy** rather than a settled ontology of experience; compatible with multiple metaphysical interpretations (identity, functionalism, representationalism)    |
| **Unity & Subjecthood**             | Unity typically arises from hierarchical model coherence and control integration; subjecthood is usually **implicit or assumed**, not explicitly theorized                                     |
| **Phenomenal Structure**            | Often treated in **representational or inferential terms** (e.g., perceptual content as prediction); phenomenology is variably addressed and frequently bracketed                              |
| **Time, Persistence & Gaps**        | Continuous dynamical updating over time; persistence reflects ongoing predictive control; gaps are rarely treated as experiential absences in their own right                                  |
| **Diagnostics & Epistemic Access**  | **Permitted and common**: experience and perception are often operationalized via report, task performance, and neural prediction-error signatures                                             |
| **Testability / Defeat Conditions** | Empirically testable at the level of prediction-error dynamics and neural implementation; does not typically specify defeat conditions for experience *as such*                                |
| **AI & Artificial Systems**         | Broadly applicable to artificial systems implementing predictive architectures; experience attribution depends on additional assumptions beyond the PP framework itself                        |
| **Ethical Standing**                | Ethical implications are typically **not derived** directly; moral status is usually bracketed or imported from external theories                                                              |
| **Evaluator Hazards**               | Often misread as a complete theory of consciousness rather than a general explanatory framework; ambiguity about experience is mistaken for implicit commitments                               |

## **Notes on Relation to IER (Non-Evaluative)**

* PP and IER operate at **different explanatory levels**:

  * PP explains **how systems regulate perception and action**
  * IER explains **what experience is, if it exists**
* PP commonly allows **diagnostics and operationalization**
* IER **forbids diagnostics in principle**
* Many PP-compatible ontologies are **identity-incompatible** with IER, but PP itself does not fix one

## **Panpsychism**

| Rubric Dimension                    | **Panpsychism**                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Explanandum Framing**             | Experience or proto-experience as a fundamental feature of reality; consciousness is not explained from non-experiential bases                                                        |
| **Ontological Claim Type**          | **Fundamental-property view**: experiential properties are basic constituents of the physical (or identical with physical properties at the base level)                               |
| **Unity & Subjecthood**             | Typically **ubiquitous and distributed** subjecthood; unity at macroscopic scales requires additional principles (aggregation, combination, or dominance), which vary by variant      |
| **Phenomenal Structure**            | Often **primitive** at the base level; higher-level phenomenology may be structured via combination relations, but qualitative character is not reduced to non-experiential structure |
| **Time, Persistence & Gaps**        | Persistence generally tracks the persistence of fundamental entities; experiential continuity is often assumed rather than explicitly theorized                                       |
| **Diagnostics & Epistemic Access**  | **Permitted in principle** via metaphysical attribution rather than empirical detection; experience is typically inferred from ontological commitments, not measured                  |
| **Testability / Defeat Conditions** | Primarily **conceptual and metaphysical**: coherence of combination principles, avoidance of explanatory gaps, and compatibility with physical theory                                 |
| **AI & Artificial Systems**         | Often **broadly inclusive**: artificial systems may possess experience insofar as they instantiate the relevant fundamental properties                                                |
| **Ethical Standing**                | Ethical implications are often **expansive**: widespread moral considerability is sometimes inferred, though specific ethical frameworks vary                                         |
| **Evaluator Hazards**               | Frequently mischaracterized as “everything is fully conscious”; internal diversity and unresolved combination problems are flattened or ignored                                       |

## **Notes on Relation to IER (Non-Evaluative)**

* Panpsychism and IER differ at the **most basic ontological level**:

  * Panpsychism treats experience as **fundamental or ubiquitous**
  * IER treats experience as **non-fundamental and regime-bound**
* Panpsychism allows **micro-experience**
* IER explicitly denies micro- or ubiquitous experience
* These differences are **identity-level incompatibilities**, not disputes over correlates or evidence

## **Higher-Order Thought (HOT)**

| Rubric Dimension                    | **Higher-Order Thought (HOT)**                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Explanandum Framing**             | Conscious experience as a mental state that is represented, monitored, or thought about by a higher-order state                                                          |
| **Ontological Claim Type**          | **Access-dependent identity or constitutive relation**: a mental state is conscious iff it is the target of an appropriate higher-order representation                   |
| **Unity & Subjecthood**             | Unity typically derives from the integration of higher-order monitoring; subjecthood is often treated as implicit rather than ontologically primitive                    |
| **Phenomenal Structure**            | Qualitative character is often tied to the content of higher-order representations; debates exist over whether first-order states carry phenomenology independently      |
| **Time, Persistence & Gaps**        | Consciousness exists when higher-order representation is present; gaps occur when monitoring lapses, even if first-order states continue                                 |
| **Diagnostics & Epistemic Access**  | **Constitutive and central**: some form of higher-order access is required for experience; reportability and introspection play key roles                                |
| **Testability / Defeat Conditions** | Testable via dissociations between first-order processing and higher-order access; challenges arise from alleged misrepresentation and regress problems                  |
| **AI & Artificial Systems**         | Artificial systems could be conscious if they implement appropriate higher-order monitoring architectures; certification depends on access and representational criteria |
| **Ethical Standing**                | Ethical implications are typically indirect; moral status is often linked to the presence of higher-order awareness rather than first-order states alone                 |
| **Evaluator Hazards**               | Often conflated with GNW or treated as denying phenomenology outright; internal debates about unconscious qualia are oversimplified                                      |

## **Notes on Relation to IER (Non-Evaluative)**

* HOT and IER disagree on **constitutive conditions**:

  * HOT makes experience contingent on **higher-order access**
  * IER denies any access or representation requirement
* HOT permits **diagnostic inference via access**
* IER **forbids diagnostics in principle**
* These differences are **structural and identity-level**, not disagreements about evidence

## **Enactivism (Without Identity)**

| Rubric Dimension                    | **Enactivism (Non-Identity)**                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Explanandum Framing**             | Sense-making, lived engagement, and meaningful world-involvement; experience is characterized through activity rather than isolated internal states           |
| **Ontological Claim Type**          | **Process-relational explanatory stance**: rejects reduction to inner representations, but typically avoids strict identity claims about experience           |
| **Unity & Subjecthood**             | Unity arises from **ongoing embodied activity and organizational autonomy**; subjecthood is relational and often context-dependent                            |
| **Phenomenal Structure**            | Phenomenology is emphasized descriptively (lived structure, affordances, salience), but rarely grounded in a precise physical or organizational identity      |
| **Time, Persistence & Gaps**        | Experience understood as **temporally extended activity**; continuity emphasized, while gaps or cessation are under-theorized                                 |
| **Diagnostics & Epistemic Access**  | **Permitted and common**: experience is approached via behavioral engagement, phenomenological report, and interactive competence                             |
| **Testability / Defeat Conditions** | Evaluated via coherence with biological autonomy, sensorimotor engagement, and explanatory adequacy; rarely specifies defeat conditions for experience itself |
| **AI & Artificial Systems**         | Often skeptical of disembodied AI; artificial systems may qualify if they achieve genuine autonomy and world-involvement, criteria often left open            |
| **Ethical Standing**                | Ethical significance typically linked to **forms of life, vulnerability, or relational participation**, not derived from a sharp ontological threshold        |
| **Evaluator Hazards**               | Frequently misread as an identity theory or as “anti-physicalist”; lack of identity claim is mistaken for evasion rather than pluralism                       |

## **Notes on Relation to IER (Non-Evaluative)**

* Enactivism (non-identity) and IER differ in **explanatory ambition**:

  * Enactivism prioritizes **how experience is enacted and lived**
  * IER specifies **what experience is, ontologically**
* Enactivism allows and relies on **diagnostics and phenomenological access**
* IER **forbids diagnostics in principle**
* The divergence is one of **identity commitment vs explanatory stance**, not empirical disagreement

| **Explanandum Framing**             | Experiential unity explained via specific physical or neural mechanisms that co-vary with unified experience                                         |
| **Ontological Claim Type**          | Typically **mechanistic or causal**: unity is produced, supported, or enabled by particular structures or processes rather than identified with them |
| **Unity & Subjecthood**             | Unity is achieved when the relevant correlate is active; subjecthood is often **implicitly assumed** rather than explicitly defined                  |
| **Phenomenal Structure**            | Qualitative character is usually **secondary or downstream**; focus is on unity/binding rather than detailed phenomenology                           |
| **Time, Persistence & Gaps**        | Unity persists while the correlate is active; gaps in activity are often treated as gaps in experience without further ontological analysis          |
| **Diagnostics & Epistemic Access**  | **Permitted and central**: correlates are often treated as indicators or markers of experience or unity                                              |
| **Testability / Defeat Conditions** | Empirically testable via correlation and intervention; theories are challenged if the proposed correlate dissociates from reported unity             |
| **AI & Artificial Systems**         | Artificial systems may qualify if they implement analogous correlates; criteria are typically architectural or functional                            |
| **Ethical Standing**                | Ethical implications are usually **not specified**; moral status is often inferred indirectly, if at all                                             |
| **Evaluator Hazards**               | Correlation is mistaken for identity; absence of a correlate is treated as proof of non-experience; mechanisms are over-interpreted as diagnostics   |

## **Notes on Relation to IER (Non-Evaluative)**

* Correlate-based theories and IER differ in **explanatory role**:

  * Correlate-based approaches treat mechanisms as **explanatory or indicative**
  * IER treats correlates as **structural consequences without diagnostic authority**
* Correlate-based theories often allow **third-person inference**
* IER **forbids third-person diagnostics in principle**
* The disagreement is about **what correlates are allowed to do**, not whether they exist

## **Functionalism**

| Rubric Dimension                    | **Functionalism**                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Explanandum Framing**             | Mental states (including conscious states) defined by their **functional roles** in mediating inputs, internal states, and outputs               |
| **Ontological Claim Type**          | **Role-based identity**: mental states are identical to functional roles, multiply realizable across physical substrates                         |
| **Unity & Subjecthood**             | Unity arises from integration of functional roles within a system; subjecthood is often **implicit or derivative**, not ontologically basic      |
| **Phenomenal Structure**            | Frequently treated as **functional or representational**; qualitative character is often reduced, reinterpreted, or treated as secondary         |
| **Time, Persistence & Gaps**        | Persistence depends on continuity of functional organization; gaps occur when role-implementing processes are interrupted                        |
| **Diagnostics & Epistemic Access**  | **Permitted and central**: experience is typically inferred from functional organization, behavior, or computational role                        |
| **Testability / Defeat Conditions** | Evaluated via functional equivalence, explanatory adequacy, and behavioral or computational success; less emphasis on identity-level incoherence |
| **AI & Artificial Systems**         | Broadly **inclusive**: artificial systems implementing the right functional roles are candidates for experience, regardless of substrate         |
| **Ethical Standing**                | Moral status is often tied to functional capacities (e.g., interests, preferences, agency), not categorical subjecthood                          |
| **Evaluator Hazards**               | Functional success is conflated with experiential existence; multiple realizability obscures questions of intrinsic ownership or unity           |

## **Notes on Relation to IER (Non-Evaluative)**

* Functionalism and IER differ at the **identity criterion**:

  * Functionalism treats **role realization as sufficient**
  * IER denies functional sufficiency and requires **intrinsic, non-offloadable constraint**
* Functionalism allows **diagnostic inference from behavior or architecture**
* IER **forbids diagnostics in principle**
* The disagreement concerns **what fixes experiential identity**, not explanatory usefulness

## **Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR)**

| Rubric Dimension                    | **Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR)**                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Explanandum Framing**             | Conscious experience as discrete moments (“events”) arising from fundamental physical processes linked to quantum state reduction                                   |
| **Ontological Claim Type**          | **Hybrid identity/emergent view**: experience arises from objective quantum state reductions orchestrated by neurobiological structures (microtubules)              |
| **Unity & Subjecthood**             | Unity achieved through **orchestrated coherence** across microtubular quantum processes; subjecthood corresponds to coordinated reduction events                    |
| **Phenomenal Structure**            | Qualitative character tied to patterns of quantum computation and collapse; phenomenology is grounded in fundamental physical processes rather than functional role |
| **Time, Persistence & Gaps**        | Experience is **discrete and event-based**; temporal flow consists of successive reduction events; gaps correspond to absence of collapse                           |
| **Diagnostics & Epistemic Access**  | **Permitted and sought**: theory motivates searching for quantum signatures in neural tissue as correlates or indicators of consciousness                           |
| **Testability / Defeat Conditions** | Vulnerable to empirical refutation if required quantum coherence or objective reduction mechanisms are not physically realized in brains                            |
| **AI & Artificial Systems**         | Artificial consciousness unlikely unless systems instantiate the relevant quantum-gravitational processes; classical digital AI typically excluded                  |
| **Ethical Standing**                | Ethical implications are usually **not systematically derived**; moral relevance is sometimes suggested for systems capable of Orch-OR processes                    |
| **Evaluator Hazards**               | Often dismissed solely on empirical skepticism; quantum claims are conflated with mysticism or panpsychism without engaging the specific identity proposal          |

## **Notes on Relation to IER (Non-Evaluative)**

* Orch-OR and IER differ at the **physical basis of identity**:

  * Orch-OR locates experience in **fundamental quantum-gravitational processes**
  * IER locates experience in **organizational regimes of intrinsic constraint**
* Orch-OR allows and encourages **diagnostic investigation**
* IER **forbids diagnostics in principle**
* The disagreement is **ontological**, not merely empirical

## **Analytic Idealism**

| Rubric Dimension                    | **Analytic Idealism**                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Explanandum Framing**             | Reality itself is experiential or mental in nature; individual experiences are dissociated segments of a universal mind                                   |
| **Ontological Claim Type**          | **Monistic idealism**: only mind (or mentation) fundamentally exists; the physical world is a representation or appearance within experience              |
| **Unity & Subjecthood**             | Ultimate unity at the level of a **single universal subject**; individual subjects arise via dissociation or partitioning                                 |
| **Phenomenal Structure**            | Phenomenal qualities are **primitive and fundamental**; structure arises within experience rather than grounding it                                       |
| **Time, Persistence & Gaps**        | Persistence is grounded in ongoing mentation of the universal mind; individual experiential streams may appear discontinuous due to dissociation dynamics |
| **Diagnostics & Epistemic Access**  | **Permitted in principle** via metaphysical inference and introspection; physical correlates are treated as indirect appearances of mental processes      |
| **Testability / Defeat Conditions** | Primarily **conceptual and explanatory**: internal coherence, parsimony, and ability to account for physical regularities without contradiction           |
| **AI & Artificial Systems**         | Artificial systems are typically **not independent subjects**; at most they are representations or processes within the universal mind                    |
| **Ethical Standing**                | Ethical implications often emphasize **universal moral considerability**, grounded in shared underlying subjecthood                                       |
| **Evaluator Hazards**               | Often misread as denying the reality of the physical world rather than reinterpreting it; conflated with panpsychism or phenomenological primacy          |

## **Notes on Relation to IER (Non-Evaluative)**

* Analytic Idealism and IER differ at the **most basic ontological level**:

  * Analytic Idealism treats **experience as fundamental**
  * IER treats experience as **non-fundamental and physically identical**
* Analytic Idealism allows **introspective and metaphysical access** to reality
* IER explicitly **denies epistemic authority of experience**
* The disagreement is **ontological and explanatory**, not empirical

## **Closing Orientation**

This document does not attempt synthesis or convergence.

It exists to enforce a single methodological constraint:

> **A theory of experience must be evaluated according to the kind of explanation it claims to provide — not according to the questions another theory finds natural to ask.**

IER’s refusal of diagnostics, IIT’s embrace of measurement, GNW’s focus on access, PP’s framework status, panpsychism’s fundamentality, and enactivism’s relational stance are **not gaps**.

They are **commitments**.
