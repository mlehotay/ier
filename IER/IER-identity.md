## Abstract

Common identity theories tie “who you are” to memory, narrative continuity, psychological similarity, or uninterrupted consciousness. IER rejects all of these as identity conditions. Under IER, personal identity persists because a **persisting physical system** continues to **own** a structured space of **admissible futures** under **intrinsic constraint**. This makes identity **forward-structured**: it is grounded in what the system can still undergo and must still bear, not in what it can recall or how continuous experience feels.

This document explains why memory loss does not erase identity, why radical life change is not subject replacement, and why experiential gaps (sleep, anesthesia) do not imply death and rebirth. It also clarifies why memory *feels* authoritative without becoming an epistemic or identity criterion, and why the direction of time in identity talk is induced by **irreversible constraint deformation**, not by stored past contents.

## 1. The Identity Mistake Cluster

Identity confusion reliably arises when readers import one of three default models:

1. **Identity-as-content:** you remain you by retaining stable traits, values, personality, or psychological character.
2. **Identity-as-memory:** you remain you by preserving autobiographical continuity and recall.
3. **Identity-as-continuous-experience:** you remain you only if consciousness never truly “turns off.”

IER rejects all three because they treat identity as a *property of what is present* (contents, reports, self-model) rather than a property of **the system that bears constraint**.

IER’s guiding reversal is simple:

> **Identity is not “sameness of what is experienced.”
> Identity is persistence of the system that owns intrinsic constraint and admissible futures.**

## 2. The Core Claim

### 2.1 Identity as persistence of constraint ownership

IER’s identity claim can be stated compactly:

> **Personal identity persists not by sameness of content, memory, or narrative,
> but by continued ownership of admissible futures under intrinsic constraint.**

“Ownership” here is not legal, moral, or introspective. It is structural:

* **Intrinsic constraint** is unavoidable internal burden within the system’s integrated regime.
* **Ownership** is the fact that this burden is borne *from within* the same persisting system: there is no external party that can carry it away, and no detachability that would relocate it to another bearer.
* **Admissible futures** are physically possible continuations of the system’s regime-capable organization.

Identity persists when the same persisting system remains the locus where intrinsic constraint binds and future trajectories remain *its* trajectories.

### 2.2 Forward-structured identity

Most identity talk is backward-looking (“I am who I was because I remember”). IER treats this as a phenomenological overlay that can fail without threatening identity.

IER identity is **forward-structured**:

* It is anchored in **continued capacity and continuation**, not in retained descriptions of the past.
* It is governed by **what can still happen to this system**, not by what it can narrate about itself.

This is why identity under IER survives amnesia, discontinuity, and deep transformation.

---

## 3. Minimal Presuppositions (No New Machinery)

This document assumes only what IER already commits to elsewhere:

* Experience exists iff a physical system sustains a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally coherent dynamical regime under intrinsic constraint.
* UEFs are **regimes**: they can stabilize, destabilize, dissolve, and re-form.
* Persons persist as **systems**, not as experiential episodes.
* Many changes in lived character are explained by **participation and organization shifts** within a persisting regime-capable system (not by creation of new subjects).

Identity is therefore not a special substance, a soul, a narrative thread, or a stored continuity relation. It is the persistence of the same system as the bearer of intrinsic constraint and the owner of admissible continuation.

---

## 4. Diachronic Identity Leak Prevention

The following refusals are not rhetorical. They are structural entailments of IER’s commitments.

### Explicit refusals (read literally)

* **Identity ≠ memory.**
* **Identity ≠ narrative continuity.**
* **Identity ≠ psychological similarity (traits, values, personality).**
* **Felt authority of memory ≠ epistemic authority.**
* **Irreversible change ≠ subject replacement.**
* **Experiential gaps ≠ death and rebirth.**
* **Time-direction in identity discourse is induced by irreversible constraint deformation, not by stored past contents.**

Each refusal prevents a specific leak:

* If identity were memory, amnesia would be annihilation.
* If identity were narrative, confabulation could manufacture persons.
* If identity were similarity, ordinary development would generate continuous replacement.
* If identity required unbroken consciousness, sleep would be recurrent death.
* If “past authority” were epistemic, memory would become an oracle rather than an organizational stabilizer.
* If time direction were “because the past is kept,” we would smuggle storage back into IER’s account of history.

IER blocks all of these.

## 5. Continuity Without Continuous Experience

A central distinction does nearly all the work:

* **UEFs are regimes.**
* **Persons are persisting systems capable of sustaining such regimes over time.**

A regime may be absent while the system persists. Therefore:

> **Continuous experience is not required for continuous identity.**

### 5.1 Dreamless sleep (regime absence, system persistence)

In dreamless sleep, there may be no coherent intrinsic-constraint window sustaining a UEF. On IER, that means **no experience** during that interval.

But the system persists, and with it:

* the same locus of intrinsic constraint-bearing capacity
* the same structured space of admissible future regimes

Identity therefore does not “pause.” Experience may.

### 5.2 General anesthesia (forced dissolution, possible preservation)

General anesthesia can suppress global integration such that a UEF cannot be sustained. Again: experience may be absent.

Identity persists insofar as:

* the same system survives, and
* retains capacity to re-enter a coherent UEF regime.

No stored experiential stream is needed, because identity is not a stream.

### 5.3 “Blackout” periods (memory failure is not identity failure)

Blackouts and amnesic gaps are often treated as identity threats because people confuse identity with recall.

IER’s response is blunt:

* Loss of recall is loss of **future accessibility** to certain organizations.
* It is not evidence that the system stopped being the bearer of intrinsic constraint.

Identity remains because the burden remained where it always was: in the same persisting system.

## 6. Radical Change Without Replacement

People often say, sincerely, “I became a different person.” Under IER, this sentence is typically true in one sense and false in another.

### 6.1 What “different person” usually tracks

Ordinary “different person” talk tracks changes in:

* salience priorities
* affective tone
* action selection patterns
* narrative organization
* participation topology (what processes participate and how strongly)
* constraint distribution and slack

These can change dramatically—sometimes abruptly—within the same persisting system.

### 6.2 What “replacement” would require (and why it’s rare)

“Replacement” is not “big change.” Replacement would require that:

* the original system’s capacity to own any future UEF is **irreversibly destroyed**, **or**
* ownership of intrinsic constraint is somehow **relocated** to a different system (a move IER does not grant via copying, storytelling, or similarity).

Irreversible change within a persisting system is not replacement. It is **constraint geometry deformation**: the system’s admissible continuation space has been reshaped by irreversible resolution, sedimentation, and reorganization.

### 6.3 Three paradigms

#### Development

A child becomes an adult: values, skills, temperament, and self-description change. Under IER, this is expected:

* the system persists
* intrinsic constraint remains internal
* admissible futures reorganize, but remain jointly owned by the same system

#### Trauma and narrowing

Trauma can harden constraint, reduce slack, and rigidly recruit threat-relevant processes. The person may feel “not like themselves.”

IER interprets this as:

* severe deformation of constraint geometry and participation
* not subject replacement

The same bearer is still bearing.

#### Recovery and expansion

Recovery can restore slack, diversify participation, and reopen parts of the continuation space. This can feel like “getting myself back.”

IER interprets this as:

* reorganization within the same persisting system
* not return of a vanished subject

## 7. Why Memory Feels Like Identity (But Isn’t)

Memory has two features that seduce people into treating it as identity:

1. **It is about “me.”** (mineness, ownership-feel)
2. **It stabilizes organization.** (it shapes what you do next)

IER accepts both while denying the identity inference.

### 7.1 Memory is future accessibility

IER rejects storage metaphors: memory is not an archive of past experience preserved inside the mind.

Instead, memory is a **reachability fact**:

* under current constraint geometry, certain organizations can be re-entered (or not)
* certain pathways can be reactivated (or not)

Forgetting is not erasure of a past. It is loss of re-entry under present constraint.

### 7.2 Felt authority: organizational, not epistemic

Memories often feel authoritative: “I know who I am because I remember.”

IER’s correction:

* Memory can be **structurally decisive** (it changes what becomes admissible next),
* without being **epistemically privileged** (it can be distorted, confabulated, incomplete),
* and without being an **identity condition**.

The feeling of authority is a stabilization signal inside the system—an organizational weight—not a criterion of who exists.

## 8. Identity and the Arrow of Time

Identity talk is time-asymmetric. We treat the past as fixed and the future as open. IER explains this without reintroducing stored past contents.

### 8.1 Time-direction via irreversible constraint deformation

Under IER, the direction of time is induced by irreversibility:

* constraint resolutions eliminate alternatives
* admissible futures collapse into realized trajectories
* the system’s geometry hardens in ways that cannot be undone without destroying the regime or the system’s organization

This is why “who you are” reflects a history without storing it:

* history persists as *deformation* of what remains possible
* not as retained experiential content

### 8.2 Persistence is not sameness; it is continued bearing

A persisting person is not a frozen snapshot carried forward.

A persisting person is:

* the same system
* continuing to bear intrinsic constraint
* continuing to traverse and reshape admissible futures

Identity is the continuity of this bearing, not continuity of any particular experiential storyline.

## 9. Boundary Statements and Edge Pressure

This section is not diagnostic. It is a boundary fence.

### 9.1 Copies, reconstructions, and “uploads”

Copying contents (memories, traits, narratives) does not copy **ownership**. Under IER, ownership is not informational possession; it is where intrinsic constraint binds in a persisting system.

So:

* similarity does not entail identity
* copying does not transfer the bearer
* duplication does not duplicate the original subject’s persistence

### 9.2 Dissociation language (“parts,” “multiple selves”)

IER treats many “multiple selves” reports as changes in:

* participation topology
* salience partitioning
* ownership-feel distribution

These are real and serious phenomena *within* a system, but they are not automatically subject multiplication.

### 9.3 Split pressures

Cases that tempt “two persons” interpretations are handled, in IER, by regime dominance and participation structure: what matters is whether there is one globally binding UEF regime or a categorical transition. This document does not adjudicate empirical cases; it only states the structural constraint: IER does not grant “partial persons” as a third category.

---

## 10. What This Document Does Not Do

This document does **not**:

* provide a test for “same person”
* define legal or moral responsibility
* settle metaphysical survival debates
* grant special epistemic authority to self-report or memory
* introduce thresholds for UEF onset, dissolution, or capacity loss

It is an explanatory compression: given IER’s commitments, here is what “identity over time” must mean and must not mean.

---

## Conclusion: Identity Compression

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* experience exists only in **UEF regimes**
* regimes can interrupt without implying annihilation
* persons persist as **systems** capable of bearing intrinsic constraint and sustaining future regimes
* memory is about **future accessibility**, not about storing a past
* large change is **constraint reorganization**, not subject replacement

So the answer to “Why am I still me?” is not “because I remember” and not “because I stayed the same.”

It is:

> **Because the same persisting system continues to own the admissible futures that must be lived under intrinsic constraint.**

### Structural Fact (one-line)

*A past can stop being reachable without a subject stopping being the one who must continue.*
