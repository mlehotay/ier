# **Instinct Illustrated: Squirrel Nest Construction**

### *Constraint-guided assembly without knowledge, planning, or stored instruction*

## **1. Status and scope**

This article is **illustrative and non-normative**.

It introduces:

* no new primitives
* no criteria or diagnostics
* no claims about experience, intention, or intelligence

Its purpose is to clarify how **apparently flexible, context-sensitive instinctive behavior** can arise under Informational Experiential Realism (IER) **without invoking stored knowledge, plans, or representation**.

The squirrel example is chosen because it is commonly misdescribed as “knowing how” to build a nest.

## **2. What the squirrel does not know**

Under IER, a squirrel does **not** possess:

* an internal model of “a nest”
* a stored construction plan
* encoded ancestral knowledge
* foresight about weather or insulation
* a representation of the finished structure

The squirrel does not aim at a goal state.
It does not compare outcomes.
It does not consult a template.

Any account that treats nest construction as execution of stored instructions is **structurally unsupported**.

## **3. The inherited constraint field**

A squirrel begins life inside a **species-shaped constraint field**, defined by:

* body size and joint geometry
* gripping and tearing affordances
* available materials (leaves, twigs, bark)
* thermal vulnerability
* locomotor balance limits
* nesting site affordances (trees, forks, cavities)

These constraints determine:

* which materials can be manipulated
* which placements are stable
* which assemblies collapse
* which sites permit continued occupation

As with the spider, the squirrel does not begin with an open design space.
It begins inside a **severely restricted region of viable constructions**.

## **4. Assembly as local viability preservation**

Nest construction proceeds through local actions:

* gathering materials that can be carried
* placing them where they do not immediately fall
* packing until collapse risk decreases
* adjusting when instability occurs

Crucially:

* unstable placements fail immediately
* unusable sequences terminate
* structurally incompatible configurations cannot accumulate

There is no evaluation of “correctness.”
There is only **continuation or breakdown**.

Assemblies that permit continued traversal persist.
Assemblies that do not are abandoned — not remembered.

## **5. Flexibility without representation**

Squirrel nests vary:

* by environment
* by material availability
* by weather conditions
* by individual history

This variation is often mistaken for planning or learning.

Under IER, it reflects:

* **constraint-sensitive traversal**, not internal models
* responsiveness to local viability, not goal tracking
* adjustment under load, not foresight

Flexibility arises because **constraints operate continuously**, not because a plan is being updated.

## **6. Attractors in a broader topology**

Compared to spider webs, squirrel nests occupy a **broader attractor basin**:

* more materials are viable
* more geometries remain stable
* more local repairs are possible

But the same principle applies:

* unstable configurations collapse
* viable ones persist
* recurrence emerges from survival, not encoding

The nest form is not known.
It is what remains.

## **7. Contrast with sedimentation and learning**

It is important to distinguish three structures:

* **Instinct** — inherited constraint topology
* **Sedimentation** — deformation via traversal
* **Learning** — owned sedimentation within a persisting system

A squirrel may later refine nest construction through sedimentation.
But the **initial capacity** to build a nest does not depend on prior experience.

The starting topology already excludes most non-nest-like possibilities.

## **8. Why this looks like “knowing how”**

From the outside, squirrel behavior appears competent because:

* failure modes are invisible or brief
* successful structures dominate observation
* alternatives never accumulate

We observe only what survives.

This creates the illusion of knowledge where there is only **constraint-guided continuation**.

---

## **9. Explicit misreadings blocked**

This account rejects:

* nest construction as execution of a plan
* instinct as encoded ancestral memory
* flexibility as representation
* success as evidence of foresight

Nothing is recalled.
Nothing is consulted.
Nothing is selected against an internal standard.

Instinct remains **structural, not cognitive**.

---

## **10. Intermission**

**Structural fact:**
*Instinctive competence reflects the absence of viable alternatives, not the presence of knowledge.*

---

## **Explicit closure**

This article introduces no new explanatory axis.

It shows how **apparently intelligent construction behavior** can arise when a system begins life inside a **pre-shaped constraint topology** that sharply restricts viable futures.

A squirrel does not know how to build a nest.
It survives only by moving within the narrow paths that do not collapse.
