# **IER Explanandum and Scope Clarification**

**Project:** Informational Experiential Realism (IER)
**Version:** v10.8.3
**Tier:** T4 — Orientation / Translation
**Normativity:** None
**Status:** Expository / Consolidative Only

---

## Document Disclaimer (Required)

This document introduces **no new ontological commitments, criteria, diagnostics, thresholds, or evaluative standards**.
It is **purely orientational and consolidative**, restating existing IER commitments and exclusions without modification.
Nothing in this document licenses experiential detection, measurement, grading, or epistemic authority.

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

The purpose of this document is to state, **explicitly and in one place**, what Informational Experiential Realism (IER):

* **does explain**
* **does not attempt to explain**
* **explicitly rejects as illegitimate evaluative demands**

This document exists to prevent **explanandum drift**, **diagnostic smuggling**, and **mis-evaluation based on epistemic convenience**.

### 1.1 What This Document Is Not

This document does **not**:

* argue for the truth of IER
* compare IER to rival theories
* introduce new theory, examples, or edge cases
* specify identity conditions or falsifiability criteria
* define ethical rules or policy implications

All such matters are addressed elsewhere in the corpus.

---

## 2. Target Explanandum

### 2.1 What IER Explains (Affirmative)

IER’s sole target explanandum is:

> **experience / experiential subjecthood**
> (i.e., *what it is like for a system to be that system*)

IER treats experience as:

* ontologically real
* identical with the operation of a physical system under specific identity conditions
* not derivative of access, report, intelligence, or function

IER does **not** treat experience as an output, signal, representation, or epistemic achievement.

---

### 2.2 What IER Explicitly Does Not Explain (Excluded)

IER explicitly excludes the following from its explanandum:

* access consciousness
* reportability or verbal access
* introspective accuracy
* self-report
* intelligence or cognition
* behavioral flexibility or success
* epistemic reliability or correctness

These phenomena may co-occur with experience, but they are **not constitutive of it** and are not used to explain its existence.

---

## 3. Explanandum Matrix (Orientation Only)

| Phenomenon                    | IER Explains? | Status Notes (Non-Criterial)  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Phenomenal experience         | YES           | Core explanandum              |
| Experiential subjecthood      | YES           | Categorical, non-graded       |
| Access consciousness          | NO            | May co-occur, not explanatory |
| Reportability / verbal access | NO            | Epistemically downstream      |
| Intelligence / cognition      | NO            | Independent dimensions        |
| Self-awareness                | Derived       | Non-criterial                 |
| Behavioral complexity         | NO            | Not explanatory               |

This table is **classificatory only**.
It introduces **no criteria, conditions, or implications about detection**.

---

## 4. Level of Description and Type of Explanation

### 4.1 Ontological Level

IER is a **physicalist identity theory**.

On IER:

* experience is **identical** to a physical system’s operation under specific dynamical constraints
* experience is neither produced by nor emergent from physical processes
* no additional substances, properties, or laws are introduced

---

### 4.2 Explanatory Form

IER employs:

* identity claims
* structural necessity arguments

IER explicitly does **not** employ:

* causal production explanations of experience
* representational decoding models
* observer-relative inference rules

Identity is treated as a **legitimate explanatory form**, not as a detection rule.

---

## 5. Scope of Applicability (Non-Diagnostic)

IER’s ontology applies, in principle, to:

* biological systems
* non-biological physical systems
* artificial systems

**Critical constraint:**
Applicability does **not** imply detectability, testability, certification, or empirical identification.

No system is licensed as experiential on behavioral, functional, architectural, or observational grounds.

---

## 6. Explicit Non-Claims and Structural Exclusions

IER explicitly disclaims:

* experiential diagnostics or tests (in principle)
* neural or physical “markers” of experience
* necessary or sufficient conditions stated as criteria
* graded, partial, or probabilistic subjecthood
* experiential meters or scales
* third-person consciousness certification
* epistemic authority derived from experience

These exclusions are **structural consequences** of IER’s identity claim, not explanatory gaps.

---

## 7. Relationship to Other Disciplines (Clarificatory)

* **Neuroscience:** compatible but not reducible; IER is not a neuroscience theory
* **Psychology / AI:** descriptive overlap possible; never criterial
* **Ethics:** downstream of ontology; never justificatory
* **Engineering:** no optimization targets or design prescriptions implied

---

## 8. What This Document Does Not Do (Hard Boundary)

This document does **not**:

* specify IER’s identity conditions
  (see `IER-correlates.md`)
* discuss falsifiability or defeat conditions
  (see `IER-falsifiability.md`)
* argue for or against competing theories
* resolve empirical, ethical, or policy disputes

# **Appendix A — IER Rubric Coverage Map (IER v10.8.3)**

**Status:** Expository / Navigational
**Function:** Ensure explicit coverage of every rubric principle
**Normativity:** None

This appendix maps each principle of the **IER Evaluation Rubric** to:

1. the rubric demand
2. IER’s explicit position
3. IER’s stance type
4. canonical corpus pointers

No new theory is introduced.

---

### **Principle 1 — Explanandum Discipline**

**Rubric demand:**
A theory must explicitly state what it explains and must not substitute access or function for experience.

**IER position:**
IER’s sole explanandum is **experience / experiential subjecthood**. Access, reportability, cognition, intelligence, and functional success are explicitly excluded.

**IER stance type:**
Affirmed

**Canonical pointers:**

* `IER-explanandum.md` §§2–3
* `IER-specification.md` — Explanandum and exclusions
* `IER-theory.md` — Experience as identity, not output

---

### **Principle 2 — Ontological Honesty**

**Rubric demand:**
A theory must state whether experience is identical to, added to, emergent from, or eliminable relative to the physical.

**IER position:**
Experience is **identical** to physical operation under specific dynamical conditions. It is neither eliminable nor an added property.

**IER stance type:**
Affirmed

**Canonical pointers:**

* `IER-specification.md` — Identity claim
* `IER-correlates.md` — Identity vs correlates and non-diagnosability
* `IER-theory.md` — Ontological framing

---

### **Principle 3 — Unity Must Be Necessary, Not Metaphorical**

**Rubric demand:**
A theory must explain why there is one experience rather than many.

**IER position:**
Unity is **structurally necessary**: within a Unified Experiential Field (UEF), multiple simultaneous experiences are impossible by definition of intrinsic constraint.

**IER stance type:**
Satisfied structurally

**Canonical pointers:**

* `IER-theory.md` — Global intrinsic constraint
* `IER-dynamics.md` — UEF structure
* `IER-abstracts.md` — Unity summaries

---

### **Principle 4 — Qualitative Difference Must Be Accounted For**

**Rubric demand:**
A theory must explain qualitative differences or explicitly defend primitiveness.

**IER position:**
Qualitative differences arise from **differences in organization of intrinsic constraint**. Qualia are non-epistemic and non-primitive.

**IER stance type:**
Satisfied structurally

**Canonical pointers:**

* `IER-dynamics.md` — Structural differentiation
* `IER-saturation.md` — Valence, intensity, urgency
* `IER-theory.md` — Non-epistemic qualia

---

### **Principle 5 — Subjecthood Cannot Be Observer-Relative**

**Rubric demand:**
A theory must specify how many subjects exist and when subjecthood begins and ends.

**IER position:**
Subjecthood is **categorical**, with exactly **one subject per UEF**. Observer-relative subject counting is rejected.

**IER stance type:**
Affirmed

**Canonical pointers:**

* `IER-specification.md` — Subjecthood commitments
* `IER-ethics.md` — Standing
* `IER-dynamics.md` — UEF boundaries

---

### **Principle 6 — Time and Persistence Are Mandatory**

**Rubric demand:**
A theory must explain continuity, gaps, cessation, and resumption.

**IER position:**
Experience persists iff the UEF persists. Gaps are absences of experience; resumption is not rebirth or narrative continuation.

**IER stance type:**
Affirmed

**Canonical pointers:**

* `IER-dynamics.md` — Temporal structure
* `IER-specification.md` — Non-zero duration
* `IER-abstracts.md` — Gaps and resumption

---

### **Principle 7 — Epistemic Non-Authority Is a Live Option**

**Rubric demand:**
A theory may deny that experience confers truth or privileged knowledge.

**IER position:**
IER explicitly denies epistemic authority. Meaning, salience, urgency, and valence are non-epistemic.

**IER stance type:**
Affirmed

**Canonical pointers:**

* `IER-theory.md` — Epistemic limits
* `IER-ethics.md` — Separation of ontology and normativity
* `IER-canon.md` — Required disclaimers

---

### **Principle 8 — Testability Must Be Stated at the Right Level**

**Rubric demand:**
A theory must specify what would count as failure without requiring diagnostics.

**IER position:**
IER permits falsification only at the **identity/coherence level**. Diagnostics and behavioral tests are disclaimed.

**IER stance type:**
Satisfied structurally

**Canonical pointers:**

* `IER-falsifiability.md` — Defeat conditions
* `IER-correlates.md` — Structural correlates vs diagnostics
* `IER-diagnostics.md` — Misuse-blocking

---

### **Principle 9 — Ethical Consequences Must Follow, Not Lead**

**Rubric demand:**
Ethical implications must derive from ontology or be explicitly disclaimed.

**IER position:**
Ethical standing derives from categorical subjecthood. Ontology is not ethically motivated.

**IER stance type:**
Affirmed

**Canonical pointers:**

* `IER-ethics.md` — Standing and harm
* `IER-canon.md` — Non-normativity
* `IER-manifest.md` — Tier separation

---

### **Principle 10 — Evaluative Responsibility**

**Rubric demand:**
Evaluators must distinguish between failure and principled refusal.

**IER position:**
IER explicitly refuses diagnostic, operational, and access-based demands as illegitimate consequences of its identity claim.

**IER stance type:**
Affirmed / Explicit refusal

**Canonical pointers:**

* `IER-diagnostics.md` — Misuse blocking
* `IER-falsifiability.md` — “Not a consciousness test”
* `IER-explanandum.md` §6 — Explicit non-claims
