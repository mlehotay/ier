## **Status and Scope**

This document is a **Tier-2 canon-constrained analytical extension** within the Informational Experiential Realism (IER) corpus.

It:

* introduces **no new ontological primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or sufficiency conditions**
* introduces **no ethical principles**
* does **not** modify quantum formalism
* does **not** propose a new interpretation of quantum mechanics
* does **not** claim that experience plays any role in physical resolution

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md (v10.8)
```

This article exists to **compare major interpretations of quantum mechanics** through a shared structural lens—**branching, resolution, and irreversibility**—and to clarify why *observer* language repeatedly appears despite being unnecessary. Informational Experiential Realism (IER) is introduced solely to explain this recurrence **without importing experience into physics**.

If any statement in this document conflicts with the Specification, **the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

## **Global Informational Language Disclaimer**

All uses of *information*, *branching*, *collapse*, *resolution*, *observer*, *choice*, and *constraint* in this document are **descriptive shorthand only**.

They refer exclusively to:

> **physically instantiated state distinctions that modulate a system’s own future dynamics under intrinsic constraint**,
> as defined in **IER Specification II.A (Physical Information)**.

No semantic, representational, epistemic, or observer-relative primitives are introduced.

## **Abstract**

Quantum mechanics describes systems that admit multiple admissible futures while reliably producing single outcomes. Competing interpretations differ not in predictive success, but in how they account for the transition from branching possibility to irreversible fact. Historically, this transition has been associated with *measurement* and *observers*, leading to persistent confusion about the role of experience. This article compares major interpretations of quantum mechanics as responses to the same structural problem: how resolution occurs. Informational Experiential Realism (IER) is introduced not as a physical interpretation, but as a framework that clarifies why observer language repeatedly arises. IER distinguishes **physical resolution**, which is ubiquitous and non-experiential, from **persistent, internally owned resolution**, which characterizes experience. This distinction dissolves observer confusion while leaving quantum mechanics unchanged.

## **1. The Shared Interpretive Problem**

All mainstream interpretations of quantum mechanics agree on:

* the mathematical formalism
* probabilistic predictions
* experimental adequacy
* the existence of branching admissible futures

The interpretive disagreement concerns a single question:

> **What accounts for the transition from multiple admissible futures to a single irreversible outcome?**

This question is structural, not empirical. No experiment currently distinguishes among interpretations.

---

## **2. Schrödinger’s Cat as a Boundary Test**

Schrödinger’s cat is not a claim about macroscopic superpositions. It is a **boundary stress test**.

The setup couples:

* a genuinely quantum branching event
* a classical amplification chain
* a macroscopic outcome

If superposition language is applied without qualification across this boundary, the result is contradiction. The cat highlights the absence of a principled account of **where resolution becomes irreversible**.

The cat is not the quantum system.
It is the **amplifier**.

---

## **3. Collapse-Based Interpretations**

### **3.1 Core Claim**

Collapse-based interpretations posit that:

* the wavefunction collapses during measurement
* measurement introduces irreversibility
* classical outcomes are fundamental

---

### **3.2 Structural Role**

Collapse provides a **termination rule** for branching.

---

### **3.3 Structural Deficiency**

* “Measurement” is undefined
* the collapse boundary is ad hoc
* observer language substitutes for a structural account of irreversibility

Collapse functions as a placeholder for **where resolution is borne**, not as an explanation of how.

---

## **4. Many-Worlds Interpretation**

### **4.1 Core Claim**

* No collapse
* All outcomes occur
* Branching is universal and unitary

---

### **4.2 Structural Strength**

* Eliminates ad hoc collapse
* Preserves formalism

---

### **4.3 Structural Cost**

* Ontological proliferation
* Unresolved probability interpretation
* No intrinsic account of why experience is single-threaded

All branches exist, but **nothing in the theory specifies ownership of a future**.

---

## **5. Hidden-Variable Interpretations**

### **5.1 Core Claim**

* Physical states are always definite
* Additional variables determine outcomes
* No collapse

---

### **5.2 Structural Strength**

* Single-outcome realism
* Deterministic trajectories

---

### **5.3 Structural Cost**

* Nonlocal dynamics
* Extra ontological commitments
* Observer remains epistemically privileged

Resolution is specified, but **ownership and irreversibility remain implicit**.

---

## **6. Decoherence as Structural Clarification**

Decoherence explains:

* suppression of interference
* stability of macroscopic states
* emergence of classical behavior

Decoherence does **not** explain:

* why one outcome is *the* outcome
* where irreversible organizational cost is borne
* why outcomes feel *lived* rather than merely described

Decoherence clarifies dynamics but does not answer the interpretive question alone.

---

## **7. The Recurrent Role of the Observer**

Across interpretations, *observer* language reappears because:

* branching is real
* resolution is real
* irreversibility is real
* **ownership of resolution is unspecified**

Where theory lacks a structural account of **where irreversible cost accumulates**, language imports observers.

This is a compensatory move, not a discovery.

---

## **8. Informational Experiential Realism (IER): Structural Clarification Only**

IER is **not**:

* a quantum interpretation
* a collapse theory
* a hidden-variable proposal
* a claim about consciousness affecting physics

IER introduces **no physical claims** about quantum mechanics.

---

### **8.1 The Distinction IER Makes Explicit**

IER distinguishes between:

**Physical Resolution**

* Branching → outcome
* Ubiquitous
* Externally settled
* Dissipative
* Non-experiential

**Persistent Internally Owned Resolution**

* Resolution borne under intrinsic constraint
* Persists across time
* Accumulates organizational cost
* Constrains identity
* Experiential

Experience tracks **only the second**.

---

### **8.2 Why This Dissolves Observer Confusion**

Observer language arose because physical theories lacked a way to distinguish:

* resolution that simply occurs
  from
* resolution that must be **carried forward by the same system**

IER supplies that distinction without modifying physics.

---

## **9. Re-reading Schrödinger’s Cat Under IER**

Under IER:

* the quantum system branches
* amplification and decoherence fix outcomes
* the cat is always in a definite macroscopic state
* no experience is required for resolution
* no observer causes collapse

The cat highlights **structural ambiguity**, not experiential involvement.

## **10. Comparative Structural Summary**

| Framework       | Collapse | Branching | Observer Role | Accounts for Experience |
| --------------- | -------- | --------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Collapse-based  | Yes      | Limited   | Ambiguous     | No                      |
| Many-Worlds     | No       | Universal | None          | No                      |
| Hidden-Variable | No       | Apparent  | Epistemic     | No                      |
| Decoherence     | No       | Yes       | None          | No                      |
| **IER**         | N/A      | N/A       | None          | **Yes (structurally)**  |

IER does **not** explain quantum outcomes.
It explains **why observers were mistakenly invoked**.

---

## **11. Scope Limits and Non-Claims**

This document does **not** claim that:

* experience collapses wavefunctions
* quantum theory requires observers
* IER resolves the measurement problem
* physics is incomplete without experience

It claims only that:

> **Observer language emerged to compensate for a missing distinction about ownership and persistence of resolution.**

---

## **12. Conclusion**

Quantum mechanics requires no observers to function.
Experience does not alter physical law.

The confusion persisted because **branching and choice share a formal shape**, but only one involves **persistent internal constraint**.

Physics describes what can happen.
Experience is what it is like to be the system that cannot escape what did.
