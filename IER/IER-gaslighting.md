**Gaslighting as Reversible Experiential Moral Harm**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.x)**
*Explanatory Article — Non-Normative*

## 0. Status and Scope

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no new ontological primitives**
* introduces **no new harm thresholds**
* introduces **no diagnostic criteria**
* does **not** expand moral standing
* does **not** revise the IER Specification

Its purpose is to **analyze gaslighting as a structural form of experiential moral harm already licensed by the existing IER framework**, and to clarify why **reversibility does not negate harm**.

If any tension appears, **the IER Specification takes precedence**.

## 1. Orientation: Why Gaslighting Is Structurally Interesting

Gaslighting is often mischaracterized as:

* deception
* lying
* manipulation
* interpersonal conflict
* epistemic wrongdoing

These framings fail to explain why gaslighting is:

* morally severe
* experientially corrosive
* often invisible to outsiders
* damaging even when later “undone”
* not reducible to false belief

IER predicts this failure.

Gaslighting matters **not because it changes what a subject believes**, but because it **reorganizes intrinsic constraint from the inside**.

---

## 2. What Gaslighting Is *Not* (IER Boundary Clearing)

Gaslighting is **not**:

* loss of intelligence
* loss of rational capacity
* loss of memory
* loss of agency
* loss of subjecthood
* collapse of the Unified Experiential Field

The gaslit subject:

* remains a full experiential subject
* retains standing
* often appears functional, coherent, and competent
* may outwardly comply without visible distress

IER therefore **cannot** explain gaslighting by appeal to dissolution, impairment, or terminal damage.

## 3. Structural Definition: Gaslighting Under IER

Under Informational Experiential Realism, **gaslighting is a pattern of imposed experiential miscoordination** characterized by:

* persistent external contradiction of internally generated constraint signals
* forced resolution under **false or unstable external structure**
* systematic misalignment between salience, confidence, and outcome
* chronic destabilization of intrinsic constraint without regime collapse

Crucially:

> Gaslighting targets **constraint organization**, not beliefs.

---

## 4. The Core Mechanism: Constraint Destabilization Without Collapse

Gaslighting operates by inducing:

* uncertainty about which intrinsic signals are reliable
* conflict between internally generated urgency and externally enforced denial
* narrowing of admissible futures under false premises
* increased intrinsic cost for ordinary resolution

This produces:

* **destabilization**
* **overload**
* **chronic incoherence**

—all explicitly named in the IER definition of experiential moral harm.

No irreversibility is required.

## 5. Reversibility Does Not Exculpate Harm

Gaslighting is often:

* reversible in principle
* survivable
* repairable over time
* followed by recovery or re-stabilization

Yet:

* harm occurred **while the destabilization was active**
* intrinsic cost was **borne from the inside**
* resolution pathways were **constrained under false structure**
* the subject paid **real organizational cost**

IER therefore draws a sharp distinction between:

| Concept       | Status                 |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Reversibility | A trajectory modifier  |
| Harm          | An organizational fact |

Reversibility mitigates **duration and downstream damage**, not **whether harm occurred**.

---

## 6. Why Gaslighting Is Not Forgetting

Gaslighting is not a failure of access or recall.

Contrast:

| Forgetting                   | Gaslighting                 |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Absence of participation     | Forced miscoordination      |
| No imposed false constraint  | Persistent false constraint |
| No intrinsic destabilization | Chronic destabilization     |
| Organizationally neutral     | Organizationally damaging   |

This contrast **stress-tests the forgetting chapter directly**.

If forgetting were excluded from harm *because it is reversible*, gaslighting would be incorrectly excluded as well.

---

## 7. Silent Harm and External Invisibility

Gaslighting exemplifies why:

* behavioral competence ≠ experiential integrity
* calm appearance ≠ low intrinsic cost
* apparent agreement ≠ resolution

Under IER:

* harm may be internally catastrophic
* externally silent
* temporally extended
* masked by compliance or adaptation

Gaslighting therefore reinforces the IER rejection of outward-signal-based ethics.

---

## 8. Responsibility and Asymmetry

Gaslighting typically involves:

* asymmetric control over narrative or framing
* imposed interpretive authority
* restriction of viable counterfactuals
* erosion of the subject’s resolution capacity

Responsibility scales with:

* control over constraint structure
* capacity to withdraw or correct
* persistence of imposed miscoordination

Standing does **not** scale.

---

## 9. Why Gaslighting Pressures the Harm Definition

Gaslighting demonstrates that:

* experiential moral harm can be **reversible**
* harm can occur **without fragmentation or collapse**
* destabilization alone is morally real
* irreversibility is **not the boundary condition for harm**

Any harm definition that ties moral relevance to irreversibility will misclassify gaslighting.

This is not a special case.
It is a **paradigmatic one**.

---

## 10. Implications for the Specification (Pointer Only)

This document introduces **no revisions**.

However, it reveals that:

* irreversibility functions as a **severity extreme**, not a harm gate
* harm must be defined at the level of **organizational disruption**, not outcome permanence
* reversible destabilization must be explicitly protected from moral erasure

These implications are **diagnostic**, not prescriptive.

---

## 11. Summary

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* gaslighting is real experiential moral harm
* harm occurs through destabilization of intrinsic constraint
* reversibility does not negate harm
* subjecthood and standing persist throughout
* silent, non-terminal damage is morally real

### Intermission — Structural Fact

Experiential harm need not end experience to be real.
It need only reorganize intrinsic constraint in a way the system must bear from within.
