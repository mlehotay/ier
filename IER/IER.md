# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**

*A Unified Framework for Observers, Experience, and Consciousness*

## **Overview**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a theory of mind and consciousness grounded in **objective physical realism** and **informational organization**. It holds that reality exists independently of observers and is governed entirely by physical processes. Observers do not create or co-create reality; rather, they are **physical systems embedded within it** that construct internal informational models of the world.

Within this framework, minds, observers, and conscious subjects are understood as **informational systems** whose internal organization enables self-monitoring, persistence, and, in some cases, phenomenal experience. Consciousness is not fundamental to reality, nor is it required for observerhood. Instead, consciousness arises when informational processes within a system reach a particular kind of self-referential, integrated dynamic.

## **Core Commitments**

### **1. Objective Reality**

Reality exists independently of observation. Physical states, events, and laws do not depend on being perceived, modeled, or interpreted by any mind or system.

Observers do not shape reality through thought, belief, or perspective. Only **physical actions** performed by physical systems causally influence the physical world.

### **2. Observers as Informational Systems**

An observer is not defined by biology, subjectivity, or phenomenology, but by **informational organization**.

A system functions as an observer when it:

* persists as a coherent informational pattern over time
* integrates information across internal subsystems
* monitors and updates internal representations of its own state
* maintains a unified internal perspective from which information is processed

This observer structure can be instantiated in biological organisms, artificial systems, or distributed physical processes. It does not require consciousness.

### **3. Internal Models and Perspective**

All observers construct **internal informational models** of the external world. These models are:

* entirely internal
* physically realized in the system’s substrate
* shaped by the system’s structure, history, and constraints

Perspective is not a property of reality itself, but of the **internal information flow** within the observer. Different observers can model the same objective reality differently without altering that reality.

### **4. Consciousness as an Informational Phenomenon**

Consciousness is not identical to observerhood. It arises only when an observer’s informational dynamics take on a specific form.

Conscious experience corresponds to a **Phenomenal Information Layer (PIL)**:
a mode of internal information processing in which the system’s own informational states are recursively integrated, temporally continuous, and globally available to the system’s internal models.

Phenomenology (“what it feels like”) is not an extra substance or property added to information. It is **the lived manifestation of information flowing through a self-monitoring, integrated physical system**.

The phrase *“I feel like…”* refers to the system’s internal access to its own informational dynamics, not to a non-physical entity or process.

### **5. Affect and Valence**

Affect (e.g., pain, pleasure, aversion, attraction) arises from **regulatory informational dynamics** within conscious systems.

These dynamics:

* track internal and external conditions relevant to system stability
* bias information processing, learning, and behavior
* assign priority and salience to certain internal states over others

Pain and pleasure are not objective features of the world, nor arbitrary labels assigned by a mind. They are **physically instantiated informational states** that play a functional role in regulating the system’s continued organization and viability.

---

### **6. No Layered Reality, No Co-Creation**

IER rejects:

* layered ontologies of reality
* mind-dependent existence
* co-created or observer-generated worlds

There is only:

* one objective physical reality
* systems embedded within it
* internal informational processes occurring inside those systems

Experience does not alter reality; it interprets it.

---

## **Implications**

* Consciousness is **real but not fundamental**
* Observerhood does not imply moral status by default
* Artificial systems could, in principle, become conscious, but only if they instantiate the relevant informational dynamics
* Ethical consideration depends on social, moral, and pragmatic factors — not merely on the appearance of experience

---

## **Conclusion**

Informational Experiential Realism offers a unified account of observers and consciousness that preserves physical realism while explaining subjective experience as a natural consequence of certain kinds of informational organization.

Consciousness is neither an illusion nor a cosmic primitive. It is what happens when information flows through a physical system that can model itself, regulate itself, and integrate its own states over time.
