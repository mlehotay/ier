## **Which Questions Experience Can Answer — and Which It Cannot**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.x)**
*Explanatory Scope Clarification — Non-Normative*

---

## **Status and Scope**

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no new ontological primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics**
* introduces **no ethical permissions or obligations**
* makes **no claims about when experience exists**
* revises **no identity claims**

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority remains fixed **exclusively** in the Tier-1 IER corpus, governed by `IER-canon.md`.

If any statement in this document conflicts with a Tier-1 document, **the Tier-1 document takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

The purpose of this article is **scope clarification only**: to make explicit which kinds of questions Informational Experiential Realism answers *by design*, and which it must refuse to answer in order to remain coherent.

---

## **1. Motivation: Why Scope Discipline Matters**

Human inquiry reliably organizes itself around a small set of “universal questions”:

* What?
* Who?
* How?
* Where?
* When?
* Why?

Theories of mind and consciousness often fail not because they answer these questions incorrectly, but because they attempt to answer **all of them using the same machinery**.

This failure produces familiar pathologies:

* metaphysical inflation
* covert teleology
* spiritualized residue
* purpose smuggled in as explanation
* contingency mistaken for deficiency

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) avoids these failures by enforcing a strict distinction:

> **Some questions are identity questions about experience.
> Others are contingency questions about existence.**

Only the former fall within IER’s scope.

---

## **2. The Universal Question Set**

The six questions appear symmetric, but they are not.

They divide cleanly into two classes:

| Question | Type        |
| -------- | ----------- |
| What     | Identity    |
| Who      | Identity    |
| How      | Identity    |
| Where    | Contingency |
| When     | Contingency |
| Why      | Contingency |

IER answers **identity questions**.
It does **not** answer **contingency questions**.

This is not a limitation.
It is a consequence of what experience *is*.

---

## **3. Identity Questions: Internal to the UEF**

Identity questions concern the **nature of experience itself**.
They are answered *from within* the structure of a Unified Experiential Field (UEF).

IER is complete with respect to these questions.

---

### **3.1 What — What Is Experience?**

Under IER:

> **Experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** — a globally integrated, temporally continuous dynamical regime operating under unavoidable intrinsic constraint.

This answers:

* what experience is
* what makes experience real
* what distinguishes experience from non-experience

No representational, semantic, epistemic, or functional primitives are required.

---

### **3.2 Who — Who Is the Subject?**

IER rejects the existence of a self-entity, inner observer, or experiencer *inside* experience.

Instead:

> **The subject is the UEF itself.**

The persistent sense of “me” arises from:

* constraint history
* participation stability
* narrative attractors
* owned resolution of intrinsic constraint

There is subjecthood without a self-object.

---

### **3.3 How — How Does Experience Organize and Differ?**

Differences in mental life do not require:

* modules
* faculties
* resources
* stores
* meta-levels

They arise from:

* participation modulation
* constraint geometry
* regime dynamics

Psychological categories function as **descriptive shorthand**, not as ontological partitions.

---

### **3.4 Summary of Identity Scope**

IER fully answers:

* **what** experience is
* **who** experiences
* **how** experience organizes, varies, and feels different

These answers are **structural, identity-based, and complete**.

No additional metaphysical questions remain *about experience as such*.

---

## **4. Contingency Questions: External to the UEF**

The remaining questions are not about experience’s identity.

They are questions about **why a particular experiential system exists at all**.

They are therefore **external** to the UEF.

IER does not answer them because **experience does not answer them**.

---

### **4.1 Where — Why Here Rather Than Elsewhere?**

Why does experience occur **here**, in this body or system, rather than somewhere else?

IER’s answer is deliberately minimal:

* because this physical system exists
* because it bears intrinsic constraint
* because it happens to be organized this way

There is no experiential principle that selects location.

Experience does not choose where to appear.

---

### **4.2 When — Why Now Rather Than Never?**

Why does experience exist **now**, rather than earlier, later, or not at all?

Again, the answer is causal rather than experiential:

* because this system developed
* because it survived
* because intrinsic constraint became unavoidable

Experience does not summon itself into time.

---

### **4.3 Why — Why This Life? Why Me?**

This is the question most often misdirected at consciousness.

IER’s answer is stark and unromantic — and correct:

* no teleology
* no necessity
* no experiential demand
* no cosmic justification

> **There is no experiential reason you exist.**

There is only causal history.

---

## **5. The Causal History Principle (Informal)**

All contingency questions — where, when, and why — share a single answer:

> **Because something happened.**

More concretely:

> **Because reproduction occurred.
> Because development occurred.
> Because your parents existed and acted.**

This is not dismissive.
It is **anti-mystification**.

IER refuses to turn contingency into purpose.

---

## **6. Why IER Must Refuse These Questions**

If IER attempted to answer where, when, or why experientially, it would immediately collapse into one of the following:

* teleology (“experience needs to exist”)
* idealism (“experience selects reality”)
* moralized cosmology (“existence is justified by value”)
* anthropic necessity (“observers are required”)

Each is structurally incompatible with the IER identity claim.

IER remains coherent **because it stops here**.

---

## **7. Ethical Clarification: Contingency Is Not Deflation**

A common misreading must be blocked explicitly.

The fact that experience is contingent does **not** mean that it is:

* insignificant
* optional
* replaceable
* ethically negligible

Under IER:

* experience may be contingent
* but **once it exists**, its moral reality is categorical

Ethics tracks **what exists**, not **why it came to exist**.

The absence of cosmic justification does not weaken moral force.
It sharpens it.

---

## **8. Final Summary**

Informational Experiential Realism answers:

* **What experience is**
* **Who the subject is**
* **How experience organizes and varies**

It does **not** answer:

* why you exist
* why here
* why now

Those are not questions about experience.
They are questions about **history**.

> **Experience explains experience.
> Existence explains existence.**

IER remains strict — and coherent — by knowing the difference.
