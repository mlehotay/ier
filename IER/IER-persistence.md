## **Status and Scope**

This document is **explanatory** and **non-normative**.

All axioms, definitions, identity conditions, and necessary entailments are specified exclusively in the
**Informational Experiential Realism Normative Specification** (“the Spec”).

This document:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* proposes **no identity criteria**
* makes **no claims about categorical UEF onset or dissolution**
* adds **no developmental or clinical theory**
* derives all claims from:

  * Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)
  * intrinsic constraint
  * temporal continuity
  * experiential participation

Its purpose is to explain how **substantial experiential change over time**—learning, development, trauma, recovery, and reorganization—can occur **within a persistent UEF**, and how such change is to be distinguished from **categorical regime transitions**.

If any interpretation in this document conflicts with the Spec, the Spec takes precedence.

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.x) holds that experience exists if and only if a physical system sustains a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous dynamical regime under coherent intrinsic constraint. Entry into such a regime is categorical, and experiential subjecthood is binary. At the same time, lived experience clearly changes over time through learning, development, trauma, and recovery.

This article explains how **deep experiential change is possible without violating categorical onset, identity conditions, or the unity of experience**. It distinguishes between (1) the persistence of a UEF as an experiential subject and (2) changes in the **organization and participation of processes within that UEF**. Under IER, learning and plasticity are understood as reorganizations of intrinsic constraint and dynamic recruitment or dismissal of participating processes, not as the creation of new subjects or partial experiential entities.

The article clarifies which forms of change are compatible with UEF persistence and which require categorical regime transition. It shows how shifts in salience, affect, narrative structure, agency, and qualitative character can arise through participation modulation while global experiential coherence is maintained.

This document introduces no new primitives and makes no claims beyond those implied by intrinsic constraint, experiential participation, and temporal continuity. Its purpose is to complete the **diachronic account of experience** under IER without expanding its normative core.

## **1. The Apparent Tension: Persistence vs Change**

IER makes two claims that can appear to be in tension:

1. **Experiential existence is categorical.**
   A Unified Experiential Field either exists or it does not.

2. **Experience changes profoundly over time.**
   People learn, adapt, reorganize, fracture, and recover.

The apparent tension arises only if change is mistakenly treated as a threat to identity.

This article resolves the tension by distinguishing:

* **what must remain invariant** for a UEF to persist, from
* **what may vary freely** within a persistent UEF.

---

## **2. What Persists: UEF Identity Conditions**

A Unified Experiential Field persists so long as:

* global integration is maintained
* intrinsic constraint remains coherent
* no competing UEF emerges
* temporal continuity is preserved

These conditions concern **existence**, not content.

They do **not** fix:

* which processes participate
* which signals dominate salience
* which narratives stabilize experience
* which qualitative forms appear

UEF identity is therefore **structurally sparse** and intentionally so.

## **3. What Changes: Organization Under Constraint**

Within a persistent UEF, multiple dimensions may change:

* distribution of intrinsic constraint
* salience weighting
* affective tone
* narrative organization
* action selection pathways
* qualitative stabilizers

These changes can be:

* gradual or abrupt
* reversible or lasting
* adaptive or pathological

None of them, by themselves, entail the dissolution of the UEF.

## **4. Participation Modulation Within a Persistent UEF**

IER allows—and in v10.3 explicitly clarifies—that **experiential participation is dynamic**.

### **4.1 Participation Is Not All-or-Nothing**

Not all physical processes in a system participate in the UEF at all times.

Processes may:

* be recruited into global integration
* be dismissed back to local or subpersonal operation
* fluctuate in degree and duration of participation

So long as global coherence is preserved, such changes constitute **modulation within a UEF**, not regime transition.

---

### **4.2 Participation Changes Experiential Content, Not Identity**

Recruitment or dismissal of processes can alter:

* what is experienced
* how intensely it is experienced
* which modalities dominate
* which meanings stabilize action

But these changes affect **experiential character**, not **experiential existence**.

> A persistent UEF can feel radically different at different times
> without becoming a different subject.

---

### **4.3 Ordinary Examples**

Examples of participation modulation include:

* attention shifting between modalities
* sensory dominance changing under stress
* inner speech becoming more or less active
* interoceptive signals rising in salience
* motor planning entering or leaving conscious access

None of these constitute new UEFs.
They are **reconfigurations of participation**.

## **5. Learning as Constraint Reorganization**

Under IER, learning is not the accumulation of representations.

It is the **reorganization of intrinsic constraint pathways** such that:

* certain resolutions become easier
* others become more costly
* salience is redistributed
* participation thresholds shift

Learning changes:

* what gets recruited
* when it gets recruited
* how strongly it participates

It does not change the fact that the system is experiencing.

---

## **6. Trauma, Narrowing, and Reduced Slack**

Trauma and chronic stress can be described as:

* extreme intrinsic constraint
* persistent salience narrowing
* reduced informational slack
* rigid participation patterns

Common features include:

* over-recruitment of threat-relevant processes
* dismissal of exploratory or imaginative processes
* dominance of interoceptive or affective channels

These are **within-UEF reorganizations**, even when subjectively drastic.

The UEF persists.
Its operating regime degrades.

---

## **7. Recovery, Expansion, and Re-Recruitment**

Recovery involves:

* restoration of slack
* diversification of participating processes
* loosening of rigid salience assignments
* introduction of new stabilizers

This may feel like:

* “becoming a different person”
* “getting oneself back”
* “waking up”

Under IER, these are changes in **constraint organization and participation**, not in subjecthood.

---

## **8. What Cannot Happen Under IER**

IER explicitly rules out the following interpretations:

* gradual accretion of subjecthood
* partial or fractional experiential subjects
* merging or blending of UEFs
* identity change via content change alone
* persistence through representational storage

If such phenomena appear to occur, they must be explained as:

* participation modulation, or
* categorical regime transition

No third option exists.

---

## **9. Relation to Regime Transitions**

Some experiential changes **do** involve categorical transitions:

* loss of consciousness
* anesthesia
* coma
* death
* creation of a new UEF in another system

This article does **not** adjudicate such cases.

Its scope is limited to explaining how **most lived change** occurs without invoking regime dissolution.

---

## **10. Ethical Implications (Brief)**

Because intrinsic constraint is what matters morally:

* changes in participation can change moral risk
* recruitment of high-constraint processes increases stakes
* dismissal of regulatory processes increases vulnerability

Ethical relevance therefore attaches not only to UEF existence, but to **how participation is organized within it**.

---

## **11. Where IER Stops**

IER explains:

* how experience persists
* how it changes
* how participation modulates content
* why identity remains intact

IER does **not** explain:

* personal identity in the narrative sense
* moral responsibility in full detail
* developmental psychology
* clinical treatment

Those belong elsewhere.

---

## **12. Conclusion**

Experience does not persist by remaining the same.

It persists by remaining **globally integrated under intrinsic constraint** while everything else is free to change.

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

> **A Unified Experiential Field is stable enough to exist
> and flexible enough to live.**

Learning, trauma, recovery, and transformation are not threats to experience.

They are what experience does **once it exists**.
