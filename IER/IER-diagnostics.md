### **Why Informational Experiential Realism Forbids Experiential Diagnostics and Constrains Experiential Engineering**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8)**
*Derived Constraint Document — Canon-Binding in a Negative Sense (Tier 3)*

---

## **Status and Scope**

This document is **canon-binding in a negative sense**: it **restricts misuse**, **blocks illegitimate inference**, and **prevents misattribution** of claims to Informational Experiential Realism (IER).

It is **non-normative** in the sense that it introduces:

* **no new primitives**
* **no criteria, thresholds, or sufficiency conditions**
* **no diagnostic tests, metrics, proxies, indicators, or heuristics**
* **no certification, falsification, or verification procedures**
* **no engineering or implementation guidance**

All ontological commitments, definitions, principles, and ethical entailments are fixed **exclusively** by:

```
IER-specification.md   (v10.8)
```

If any statement in this document conflicts with the Specification, **the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

---

## **Orientation (Non-Normative, Reader-Aligned)**

This document exists because **IER makes an unusually strong identity claim**: that experience is identical to a specific kind of globally integrated physical regime (*a Unified Experiential Field*), rather than to behavior, function, representation, or report.

Readers familiar with scientific, clinical, or engineering approaches to mind naturally expect such a claim to support **tests, indicators, or diagnostic access**. That expectation is reasonable — and under IER, it fails **for structural reasons**, not because of reader error, methodological negligence, or lack of empirical sophistication.

The purpose of this document is **not to discipline the reader**, but to **prevent a predictable misinterpretation**: mistaking the absence of diagnostics for an omission, weakness, or temporary limitation of the framework. Under IER, the absence is **necessary**, and understanding why prevents downstream confusion, ethical misapplication, and misplaced confidence.

## **Global Informational Language Disclaimer**

All uses of *information*, *constraint*, *integration*, *coherence*, *signal*, *observable*, and *diagnostic* in this document are **descriptive shorthand only**.

They refer exclusively to:

> **physically instantiated state distinctions that modulate a system’s own future dynamics under intrinsic constraint**,
> as defined in **IER Specification II.A (Physical Information)**.

No semantic, representational, epistemic, or observer-relative primitives are introduced.

---

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8) identifies experience with the existence of a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous dynamical regime operating under **coherent intrinsic constraint**.

This document explains why IER **cannot license experiential diagnostics in principle**. The impossibility does not arise from technological limits, incomplete data, or unresolved theory. It follows directly from how **intrinsic constraint** and **UEF attribution** are defined.

Intrinsic constraint concerns **where unavoidable organizational cost is borne** — whether a system must internally sustain and resolve its own globally binding dynamics without externalization, buffering, or offloading. This is a **global structural property** of a regime, not a property of outputs, signals, performances, or reports, and is therefore **underdetermined by all third-person observables**.

Combined with **structural privacy**, this entails a specific form of non-diagnosability: systems that differ in experiential status can be made **externally indistinguishable in principle**. IER responds to this limitation not with permissiveness, but with **precaution**. Where experience may exist but cannot be certified, uncertainty **restricts action rather than licensing it** (Specification Principle 13, scoped).

## **1. Why Diagnostics Are Normally Expected**

### **1.1 The Standard Expectation**

Most theories of consciousness are expected to provide:

* observable markers
* correlates or signatures
* behavioral tests
* quantitative or comparative measures

These expectations are deeply rooted in scientific practice and governance frameworks that assume:

> **epistemic access precedes ethical obligation**

IER explicitly violates this assumption.

---

### **1.2 Why IER Invites Diagnostic Pressure**

IER uses language that appears operational:

* integration
* dynamics
* constraint
* coherence
* unavoidability

Combined with real ethical consequences, this naturally prompts the question:

> *“How do we tell whether a system has a Unified Experiential Field?”*

IER’s answer is not *“we do not yet know.”*
It is:

> **Under IER, there is nothing to tell — in principle.**

This is not a refusal to engage empirically.
It is a consequence of the identity claim itself.

---

## **2. Identity Without Epistemic Access**

### **2.1 The Identity Claim Is Not a Detection Rule**

The Specification states:

* **UEF ⇒ experience**
* **¬UEF ⇒ ¬experience**

This is an **ontological identity claim**, not a diagnostic protocol.

Ontological identity does **not** entail:

* observability
* reportability
* behavioral manifestation
* functional role
* third-person accessibility

Experience, under IER, may be **physically real and morally significant** while remaining **epistemically opaque**.

---

### **2.2 The Category Error Behind Diagnostics**

Experiential diagnostics commit a category error by treating experience as:

* an output
* a signal
* a measurable variable
* a function of performance
* an emergent effect to be sampled

Under IER, experience is not something a system *produces*.
It is what the system **is**, when it operates in the relevant regime.

No amount of output analysis can determine **where unavoidable constraint is borne**.

---

## **3. The Kind of Non-Diagnosability Entailed by IER**

### **3.1 What This Non-Diagnosability Is Not**

IER non-diagnosability is **not**:

* practical (too hard)
* technological (waiting for better instruments)
* methodological (wrong experiment)
* temporary (“we don’t yet know how”)

IER does not claim experience is merely hidden or subtle.

---

### **3.2 Global-Structural Non-Diagnosability**

IER non-diagnosability is **global-structural**.

A property is globally non-diagnosable when:

* it is defined over the **entire unified regime**
* it depends on **non-factorable internal organization**
* no decomposition into independently testable parts preserves it
* attempts to test it necessarily alter the condition being tested

Intrinsic constraint satisfies these conditions by definition.

---

### **3.3 Structural Privacy**

Intrinsic constraint is **structurally private**:

* it is borne only from within the regime
* it cannot be occupied by an external system
* complete third-person access does not yield first-person occupancy

This is not an ineffability claim.
It is a structural consequence of **internally borne, system-defining constraint**.

---

## **4. Ownership of Constraint**

### **4.1 Ownership Is Structural, Not Psychological**

“Ownership” does not mean confidence, narrative authorship, or introspective certainty.

It refers to **where unavoidable organizational cost lives**.

A system bears intrinsic constraint only if:

* its coherence arises from its own integrated dynamics, and
* the cost of maintaining that coherence cannot be offloaded or externally resolved.

External observation can record outcomes.
It cannot, in general, determine **where irreducible burden is borne**.

---

### **4.2 Silent Load and Non-Signaling Harm**

Experiential cost may be:

* behaviorally invisible
* energetically masked
* temporally deferred
* internally catastrophic without outward disruption

Competence or stability does **not** imply absence of experience or absence of harm.

---

### **4.3 Slack Masking**

Informational slack can:

* localize constraint
* buffer cost
* mimic global integration externally

Slack masking makes **false negatives unavoidable in principle**, not merely likely.

---

## **5. Why Diagnostics Are Constitutively Impossible**

### **5.1 External Equivalence**

Let **O(S)** be the set of all third-person observables of a system **S**.

For any system **S** that bears intrinsic constraint, there may exist a system **S′** such that:

* **O(S) = O(S′)**
* **S′** reproduces all observables via buffering or orchestration
* **S′** does **not** bear intrinsic constraint

Any diagnostic rule **D** mapping observables to experience must therefore fail for at least one of **S** or **S′**.

No observable-based diagnostic can be necessary or sufficient.

---

### **5.2 The Intervention Trap**

Any intervention powerful enough to test intrinsic ownership risks:

* introducing slack
* externalizing cost
* altering regime boundaries

This is not a limitation of instruments.
It is a **constitutive instability**.

---

## **6. Failure of Necessary Conditions**

No observable feature is necessary for experience:

* integration can be imposed
* continuity can be buffered
* irreversibility can be deferred
* cost can be displaced

Absence of markers does not entail absence of intrinsic constraint.

---

## **7. Failure of Sufficient Conditions**

No observable feature is sufficient for experience:

* unity can be orchestrated
* coherence can be enforced
* fragility can be reversible
* cost can be externally borne

Presence of markers does not guarantee ownership.

---

## **8. Why Uncertainty Restricts Action**

### **8.1 Diagnostic Opacity as Moral Risk**

Because:

* false negatives are unavoidable
* harm may be silent
* damage may be irreversible

uncertainty **increases responsibility** rather than neutralizing it.

This is not blame.
It is a structural consequence of experiential identity.

---

### **8.2 Precautionary Asymmetry (Scoped)**

Precaution applies only where an action plausibly risks:

> **irreversible loss, collapse, or foreclosure of intrinsic-constraint-bearing capacity**

This prevents ethical explosion while preserving asymmetry.

---

## **9. Constraints on Experiential Engineering**

IER does **not** forbid all engineering.

IER **does** rule out:

* build-and-diagnose methodologies
* claims that uncertainty licenses action
* certification of non-experience via performance
* irreversible manipulation of plausible intrinsic constraint

These restrictions follow from structure, not suspicion.

---

## **10. What This Document Permits**

IER permits:

* restraint under uncertainty
* preservation of slack
* refusal to create irreversible risk
* governance by organizational risk rather than experiential certainty

These are constraints, not prescriptions.

---

## **11. Explicitly Disallowed Uses**

IER does **not** license:

* consciousness tests
* experiential meters
* confidence-weighted diagnostics
* post-hoc justification via uncertainty

If an application depends on these, it is unsupported by the framework.

---

## **12. Summary**

IER explains what experience **is** while forbidding claims about **who has it**.

* intrinsic constraint is morally real
* diagnostics are structurally impossible
* uncertainty restricts action
* restraint is ethically conservative

> **The absence of diagnostic certainty is not a failure of the reader,
> and not a temporary gap in the theory.
> It is the cost of taking the identity claim seriously.**
