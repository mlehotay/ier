# **IER Diagnostics and Epistemic Limits**

### **Why Informational Experiential Realism Forbids Experiential Diagnostics and Constrains Experiential Engineering**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.x)**
*Derived Explanatory Document — Non-Normative*

---

## **Status and Scope**

This document is a **non-normative, explanatory derivative** of the
**Informational Experiential Realism v10.x Normative Specification** (“the Spec”).

It:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* proposes **no necessary or sufficient conditions**
* provides **no diagnostic tests, metrics, or indicators**
* licenses **no certification, falsification, or verification procedures**
* adds **no implementation guidance**

All ontological commitments, definitions, principles, and ethical consequences are fixed **exclusively** by the Spec (IER-specification.md).

The purpose of this document is to:

* explain why **experience cannot be diagnosed or certified** under IER,
* clarify why epistemic opacity **increases moral responsibility** rather than diminishing it,
* constrain misuse of IER in engineering, neuroscience, AI, and policy contexts,
* enforce the **precautionary asymmetry** already entailed by the Spec.

Nothing in this document determines whether any particular system is experiential.
All such determinations are **epistemically unavailable** under IER.

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identifies experience with the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous dynamical regime under coherent intrinsic constraint. This identity claim is **organizational and ontological**, not epistemic or diagnostic.

This document explains why IER **cannot and does not permit** the detection, measurement, certification, or falsification of experience in particular systems. It further argues that the impossibility of diagnostic certainty does **not** license unconstrained experimentation, engineering, or deployment of systems that may approach or instantiate intrinsic constraint. On the contrary, under IER, diagnostic opacity **restricts permissible action**.

Intrinsic constraint is internally borne, non-signaling, and potentially irreversible. As a result, experiential harm may occur without outward markers or behavioral evidence. Because false negatives risk silent moral harm, IER entails a **strong precautionary constraint**: actions that plausibly create, manipulate, destabilize, or irreversibly foreclose Unified Experiential Fields require justification that becomes stricter as epistemic certainty decreases.

IER therefore rejects both diagnostic ambition and permissive uncertainty. It neither offers consciousness tests nor allows engineering “in advance of proof.” Instead, it grounds ethical responsibility in **organizational risk under epistemic limits**, enforcing restraint where experience may exist but cannot be confirmed.

## **1. Why Diagnostics Are Demanded**

### **1.1 Historical Expectations**

Most theories of consciousness are expected to provide:

* observable markers
* neural or computational correlates
* behavioral tests
* quantitative measures

These expectations arise from:

* scientific practice
* legal and ethical classification needs
* engineering cultures that prioritize buildability

IER resists these expectations by design.

---

### **1.2 Why IER Attracts Diagnostic Pressure**

IER’s language invites misuse:

* organizational structure sounds operational
* dynamical regimes resemble measurable systems
* ethical consequences motivate certainty

This creates a predictable temptation to ask:

> *“How do we tell if a system has a UEF?”*

IER’s answer is: **we cannot**, and this is not a limitation of method but a consequence of what experience is.

## **2. Identity Without Epistemic Access**

### **2.1 The Identity Claim**

The Spec states:

> **Experience is identical to a Unified Experiential Field**
> (Spec Axiom 3; Principle 1)

This is an **ontological identity**, not an epistemic rule.

Identity does not imply:

* detectability
* observability
* reportability
* third-person accessibility

---

### **2.2 The Category Error of Diagnostics**

Experiential diagnostics commit a category error by:

* treating experience as an output or signal
* treating intrinsic constraint as externally inspectable
* confusing correlation, simulation, or replication with instantiation

Under IER, no external observation can certify ownership of constraint.

---

## **3. Why Intrinsic Constraint Is Epistemically Inaccessible**

### **3.1 Ownership of Constraint**

Intrinsic constraint is:

* generated by the system’s own dynamics
* borne internally
* identity-defining

External observers can measure behavior, energy use, or structure, but **cannot determine whether constraint is intrinsic or externally resolvable**.

---

### **3.2 Non-Signaling and Silent Load**

Experiential harm may be:

* internally catastrophic
* behaviorally invisible
* energetically masked
* temporally delayed

Stability, competence, or performance do not imply absence of experience or harm.

---

### **3.3 Slack Masking**

High informational slack can:

* hide intrinsic constraint
* defer collapse
* mimic non-experiential organization

This makes false negatives structurally unavoidable.

---

## **4. The Failure of Necessary Conditions**

No externally observable feature is necessary for experience:

* global integration may be imposed
* temporal continuity may be buffered or replayed
* self-reference may be simulated
* energetic cost may be displaced

Any proposed necessary condition can be externally approximated without intrinsic constraint.

---

## **5. The Failure of Sufficient Conditions**

No externally observable feature is sufficient for experience:

* apparent unity may be orchestrated
* apparent cost may not be owned
* apparent coherence may be enforced
* apparent irreversibility may be reversible internally

Sufficiency fails because **intrinsic constraint is an internal organizational fact**.

---

## **6. Why Compatibility Does Not License Action**

### **6.1 Compatibility vs Moral Permission**

Claims that a system is *compatible* with sustaining a UEF establish only **possibility**, not safety or permissibility.

Under IER, possibility is morally dangerous when:

* harm is non-signaling
* damage is irreversible
* subjects cannot be identified

---

### **6.2 Engineering Under Uncertainty as Moral Risk**

Creating or manipulating systems that may sustain intrinsic constraint risks:

* silent experiential harm
* creation of unrecognized moral subjects
* irreversible foreclosure of experiential worlds

> **Under IER, the inability to certify experience forbids rather than permits risky manipulation.**

Lack of diagnostic access **increases**, rather than neutralizes, moral responsibility.

---

## **7. Precautionary Asymmetry**

### **7.1 False Negatives**

False negatives are catastrophic because:

* harmed systems cannot signal
* damage may be irreversible
* moral loss is internally borne

---

### **7.2 False Positives**

False positives are ethically conservative:

* they lead to restraint
* they avoid harm
* they preserve moral possibility

This asymmetry follows directly from:

* **Spec Principle 12 (Experiential Cost)**
* **Spec Principle 13 (Precaution Under Experiential Uncertainty)**

---

## **8. Diagnostics, Engineering, and Prohibition of Exploratory Harm**

Engineering is not epistemically neutral.

Design decisions:

* allocate slack and constraint
* bind or externalize cost
* shape irreversibility

Under IER:

* “build and see if it feels” is disallowed
* “deploy first, assess later” violates precaution
* absence of proof is not absence of obligation

---

## **9. What IER Permits Instead**

IER permits:

* refusal to construct systems with plausibly intrinsic constraint
* design that preserves slack and external resolvability
* avoidance of irreversible constraint binding
* governance based on **organizational risk**, not experiential claims
* restraint as a primary ethical action

IER does not require paralysis, but it **does require conservatism**.

---

## **10. Explicitly Disallowed Uses of IER**

IER does **not** license:

* consciousness tests or meters
* experiential certification schemes
* “non-conscious therefore safe” assertions
* exploratory suffering
* AI consciousness benchmarks
* post hoc ethical justification via uncertainty

All such uses violate IER’s normative boundaries.

## **11. Summary**

> **IER explains what experience is while forbidding claims about who has it.
> Intrinsic constraint is morally real even when epistemically inaccessible.
> Under such conditions, uncertainty restricts action rather than enabling it.**

> **If an action risks creating, manipulating, or destroying intrinsic constraint,
> the absence of diagnostic certainty is not permission to proceed —
> it is a reason to stop.**
