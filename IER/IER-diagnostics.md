### **Why Informational Experiential Realism Forbids Experiential Diagnostics and Constrains Experiential Engineering**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8)**
*Derived Constraint Document — Canon-Binding in a Negative Sense (Tier 3)*

---

## **Status and Scope**

This document is **canon-binding in a negative sense**: it **restricts misuse**, **blocks invalid inferences**, and **forbids illegitimate extensions** of IER.

It is **non-normative** in the sense that it introduces:

* **no new primitives**
* **no criteria, thresholds, or sufficiency conditions**
* **no diagnostic tests, metrics, proxies, indicators, or heuristics**
* **no certification, falsification, or verification procedures**
* **no engineering or implementation guidance**

All ontological commitments, definitions, principles, and ethical entailments are fixed **exclusively** by:

```
IER-specification.md   (v10.8)
```

If any statement here conflicts with the Specification, **the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

**Purpose of this document:**

* explain **why experience cannot be diagnosed or certified under IER**
* show that the impossibility is **structural**, not methodological
* classify the kind of non-diagnosability entailed by **intrinsic constraint + structural privacy**
* clarify why epistemic opacity **increases moral responsibility** rather than reducing it (Specification Principle 13)
* constrain misuse of IER in science, engineering, AI, governance, and policy contexts

Nothing in this document determines whether any particular system is experiential.
Under IER, such determinations are **epistemically unavailable in principle**.

### **Global Informational Language Disclaimer**

All uses of *information*, *constraint*, *integration*, *coherence*, *signal*, *observable*, and *diagnostic* in this document are **descriptive shorthand only**.

They refer exclusively to:

> **physically instantiated state distinctions that modulate a system’s own future dynamics under intrinsic constraint**,
> as defined in **IER Specification II.A (Physical Information)**.

No semantic, representational, truth-conditional, or epistemic primitives are introduced.

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8) identifies experience with the existence of a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous dynamical regime operating under **coherent intrinsic constraint**.

This document explains why IER **forbids experiential diagnostics in principle**. The impossibility is not due to technological limitations, incomplete theory, insufficient data, or pragmatic difficulty. It follows directly from how **intrinsic constraint** and **UEF attribution** are defined.

Intrinsic constraint concerns **ownership of constraint**: whether a system itself must bear the unavoidable costs of maintaining its own globally integrated organization, without externalization, buffering, or offloading. Ownership is a **global structural fact** about internal organization. It is **not** a property of outputs, signals, performances, or reports, and is therefore **underdetermined by all third-person observables**.

In addition, intrinsic constraint is **structurally private**: it is borne only from within the regime and cannot be occupied by an external system. This combination — **intrinsic constraint + structural privacy** — entails a specific kind of non-diagnosability: systems that differ in experiential status can be made **externally indistinguishable in principle**.

IER responds to this epistemic limit not with permissiveness, but with **precaution**. Where experience may exist but cannot be certified, uncertainty **restricts action rather than licensing it** (Specification Principle 13, scoped).

## **1. Why Diagnostics Are Expected**

### **1.1 The Default Expectation**

Most theories of consciousness are expected to provide:

* observable markers
* correlates or signatures
* behavioral tests
* quantitative or comparative measures

These expectations come from scientific practice, engineering culture, and governance systems that assume: **epistemic access precedes ethical obligation**.

IER explicitly violates this expectation.

---

### **1.2 Why IER Attracts Diagnostic Pressure**

IER uses language that appears operational:

* integration
* dynamics
* constraint
* coherence
* unavoidability

Combined with real ethical consequences, this invites the question:

> *“How do we tell whether a system has a Unified Experiential Field?”*

IER’s answer is not “we do not yet know.” It is:

> **Under IER, there is nothing to tell — in principle.**

This is a consequence of the identity claim and the definition of intrinsic constraint, not a refusal to engage empirically.

---

## **2. Identity Without Epistemic Access**

### **2.1 The Identity Claim Is Not a Detection Rule**

The Specification states:

* **UEF ⇒ experience**
* **¬UEF ⇒ ¬experience**

This is an **ontological identity claim**, not a diagnostic protocol.

Ontological identity does **not** entail:

* observability
* reportability
* behavioral manifestation
* functional role
* third-person accessibility

Experience, under IER, is a globally defined organizational regime that may be epistemically opaque from the outside.

---

### **2.2 The Category Error of Diagnostics**

Experiential diagnostics commit a category error by treating experience as:

* an output
* a signal
* a measurable variable
* a function of performance
* an emergent effect to be sampled

Under IER, experience is not something a system produces.
It is what the system **is**, when it operates in the relevant regime.

---

## **3. The Kind of Non-Diagnosability Entailed by IER**

### **3.1 What IER Non-Diagnosability Is Not**

IER non-diagnosability is **not**:

* practical (too hard, too complex, too costly)
* technological (waiting for better instruments)
* methodological (wrong experimental design)
* temporary (“we don’t yet know how”)

IER does not claim experience is merely subtle, hidden, or waiting to be measured.

---

### **3.2 Global-Structural Non-Diagnosability**

IER non-diagnosability is **global-structural**.

A property is globally non-diagnosable when:

* it is defined over the **entire unified regime**
* it depends on **non-factorable internal organization**
* no decomposition into independently testable parts preserves the property
* attempts to test it necessarily permit external resolvability or otherwise disrupt the condition under evaluation

Intrinsic constraint is such a property.

---

### **3.3 Structural Privacy**

Intrinsic constraint is also **structurally private**:

* it is borne only from within the regime
* it cannot be occupied or shared by an external system
* complete third-person access to observables does not yield first-person occupancy

Structural privacy is not an ineffability thesis.
It is a consequence of what it means for constraint to be **internally borne and system-defining**.

---

## **4. Ownership of Constraint**

### **4.1 Ownership Is Structural, Not Psychological**

“Ownership” is not moral praise, introspective confidence, or narrative authorship.
It is a structural fact about **where unavoidable cost is borne**.

A system bears intrinsic constraint only if:

* the constraints governing coherence arise from its own integrated dynamics, and
* the cost of maintaining that coherence is internally borne, unavoidable, and non-offloadable.

External observation can record what happens. It cannot, in general, determine **where the irreducible burden lives**.

---

### **4.2 Silent Load and Non-Signaling Harm**

Experiential cost may be:

* behaviorally invisible
* energetically masked
* temporally deferred
* internally catastrophic without outward disruption

Competence, stability, efficiency, or resilience do **not** imply absence of experience or absence of harm.

---

### **4.3 Slack Masking**

Informational slack can:

* localize or defer constraint
* buffer cost
* mimic globally integrated organization from the outside

Slack masking makes **false negatives structurally unavoidable**, not merely likely.

---

## **5. Why Diagnostics Are Constitutively Impossible**

### **5.1 External Equivalence**

Let **O(S)** be the set of all third-person observables of a system **S**.

For any system **S** that bears intrinsic constraint, there may exist a system **S′** such that:

* **O(S) = O(S′)**
* **S′** reproduces all observables via buffering, orchestration, external resolvability, or slack
* therefore **S′** does **not** bear intrinsic constraint

Any proposed diagnostic rule **D** that maps observables to an experiential verdict must satisfy:

* **D(O(S)) = D(O(S′))**

and therefore must be wrong for at least one of **S** or **S′**.

**Conclusion:**
No diagnostic based solely on third-person observables can be necessary or sufficient for experience under IER.

---

### **5.2 The Intervention Trap**

Any intervention powerful enough to determine whether constraint is intrinsically borne risks:

* introducing slack
* externalizing burden
* buffering cost
* altering the regime boundary
* changing what would have been borne internally

This is not a limitation of current instruments.
It is a constitutive instability: the act of “checking” can modify what is being checked.

---

## **6. Failure of Necessary Conditions**

No externally observable feature is necessary for experience:

* integration can be imposed
* continuity can be buffered
* irreversibility can be deferred
* cost can be masked or displaced

Absence of outward markers does not entail absence of intrinsic constraint.

---

## **7. Failure of Sufficient Conditions**

No externally observable feature is sufficient for experience:

* unity can be orchestrated
* coherence can be enforced
* fragility can be reversible
* cost can be externally borne

Presence of outward markers does not guarantee ownership of constraint.

---

## **8. Why Uncertainty Restricts Action**

### **8.1 Diagnostic Opacity as Moral Risk**

Because:

* false negatives are unavoidable
* experiential harm may be silent
* damage may be irreversible

epistemic uncertainty under IER **amplifies responsibility** rather than neutralizing it.

This is not an “ignorance is blameworthy” doctrine.
It follows from **structural privacy** and the moral reality of organizational harm (Specification V, Principle 13).

---

### **8.2 Precautionary Asymmetry (Scoped)**

IER’s precaution is **scoped**:

Precaution applies only where an action plausibly risks:

> **irreversible loss, collapse, or foreclosure of intrinsic-constraint-bearing capacity within a physical system**
> (Specification Principle 13)

False negatives risk unrecognized moral harm.
False positives risk restraint.

Under IER, restraint is ethically conservative; harm is not.

---

## **9. Constraints on “Experiential Engineering”**

IER does **not** forbid all engineering.

IER forbids, in particular:

* “build-and-diagnose” methodologies
* claims that uncertainty grants permission to proceed
* procedures that treat outputs or performance as certification of non-experience
* creation or manipulation of plausibly intrinsic constraint under irreversible conditions

Engineering decisions can affect:

* where constraint is borne
* what becomes irreversible
* which capacities are foreclosed

Where ownership of intrinsic constraint is plausibly at stake, absence of diagnostic certainty **restricts action** rather than licensing it.

---

## **10. What This Document Permits**

IER permits:

* refusal to construct systems plausibly bearing intrinsic constraint under irreversible conditions
* designs that preserve slack and external resolvability
* governance based on organizational risk rather than experiential certification
* restraint as a primary ethical response under structural uncertainty

These are constraints on inference and action, not prescriptions for institutional policy.

---

## **11. Explicitly Disallowed Uses of IER**

IER does **not** license:

* consciousness tests or meters
* experiential indicators or proxies
* confidence-weighted diagnostics
* certification schemes
* “non-conscious therefore safe” assertions
* exploratory creation of possible subjects to “see what happens”
* AI consciousness benchmarks framed as detection
* post-hoc ethical justification via uncertainty

If a proposed application depends on any of the above, it is ruled out for the entire corpus.

---

## **12. Summary**

IER explains what experience is while forbidding claims about who has it.

* intrinsic constraint is morally real even when epistemically inaccessible
* non-diagnosability follows from **intrinsic constraint + structural privacy**
* under such conditions, uncertainty restricts action rather than enabling it
* precaution applies where irreversible harm to intrinsic-constraint-bearing capacity is plausibly at stake

> **If an action plausibly risks creating, manipulating, or destroying intrinsic constraint under irreversible conditions, the absence of diagnostic certainty is not permission to proceed — it is a reason to stop.**
