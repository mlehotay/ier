# **IER Diagnostics and Epistemic Limits**

## **Why Informational Experiential Realism Forbids Experiential Diagnostics and Constrains Experiential Engineering**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.6)**
*Derived Explanatory Document — Non-Normative*

---

## **Status and Scope**

This document is a **non-normative explanatory derivative** of the
**Informational Experiential Realism v10.6 Normative Specification** (“the Spec”).

It:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* proposes **no necessary or sufficient conditions**
* provides **no diagnostic tests, metrics, proxies, indicators, or heuristics**
* licenses **no certification, falsification, or verification procedures**
* adds **no implementation or engineering guidance**

All ontological commitments, definitions, principles, and ethical entailments are fixed **exclusively** by the Spec.
If any statement here appears to conflict with the Spec, the Spec takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void.

The purpose of this document is to:

* explain **why experience cannot be diagnosed or certified under IER**,
* show that this impossibility is **structural and constitutive**, not methodological,
* classify the **specific kind of non-diagnosability** entailed by IER,
* clarify why epistemic opacity **increases moral responsibility** rather than reducing it,
* constrain misuse of IER in science, engineering, AI, governance, and policy contexts,
* articulate the **precautionary asymmetry** already entailed by the Spec.

Nothing in this document determines whether any particular system is experiential.
All such determinations are **epistemically unavailable under IER**.

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identifies experience with the existence of a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally unified, temporally continuous dynamical regime operating under **coherent intrinsic constraint**.

This document explains why IER **forbids experiential diagnostics in principle**. The impossibility is not due to technological limitations, incomplete theory, insufficient data, or pragmatic difficulty. It follows directly from how **intrinsic constraint** is defined.

Intrinsic constraint concerns **ownership of constraint**: whether a system itself must bear the unavoidable costs of maintaining its own unified organization, without externalization, buffering, or offloading. Ownership is a **global structural fact** about the system’s internal organization. It is **not a property of outputs, signals, functions, performances, or reports**, and is therefore **underdetermined by all third-person observables**.

As a result, systems that differ in experiential status can be made **externally indistinguishable in principle**. No observable feature is either necessary or sufficient for experience. False negatives are therefore unavoidable and may conceal silent, irreversible harm.

IER responds to this epistemic limit not with permissiveness, but with **precaution**. Where experience may exist but cannot be certified, uncertainty **restricts action rather than licensing it**.

## **1. Why Diagnostics Are Expected**

### **1.1 Historical Expectations**

Most theories of consciousness are expected to provide:

* observable markers,
* neural or computational correlates,
* behavioral tests,
* quantitative or comparative measures.

These expectations arise from established scientific practice, engineering culture, legal classification needs, and governance frameworks that assume epistemic access precedes ethical obligation.

IER explicitly violates this expectation.

---

### **1.2 Why IER Attracts Diagnostic Pressure**

IER employs language that appears operational:

* integration,
* dynamics,
* constraint,
* coherence,
* unavoidability.

Combined with real ethical consequences, this invites the question:

> *“How do we tell whether a system has a Unified Experiential Field?”*

IER’s answer is not “we do not yet know,” but:

> **There is nothing to tell.**

This is not a refusal to engage empirically, but a consequence of the identity claim itself.

---

## **2. Identity Without Epistemic Access**

### **2.1 The Identity Claim**

The Spec states:

> **Experience is identical to the existence of a Unified Experiential Field.**

This is an **ontological identity**, not an epistemic rule or detection principle.

Ontological identity does **not** entail:

* observability,
* reportability,
* behavioral manifestation,
* functional role,
* third-person accessibility.

Many real physical facts are globally defined yet epistemically inaccessible from within the system or from any localized external probe. Experience, under IER, is one such fact.

---

### **2.2 The Category Error of Diagnostics**

Experiential diagnostics commit a category error by treating experience as:

* an output,
* a signal,
* a measurable variable,
* a function of performance,
* an emergent effect to be sampled.

Under IER, experience is not something a system *produces*.
It is something the system *is*, when it exists under inescapable intrinsic constraint.

No test can “detect” an identity relation.

---

## **3. The Kind of Non-Diagnosability Entailed by IER**

IER non-diagnosability must be carefully distinguished from other kinds of epistemic limitation.

### **3.1 What IER Non-Diagnosability Is *Not***

IER non-diagnosability is **not**:

* practical (too hard, too complex, too costly),
* technological (waiting for better instruments),
* methodological (wrong experimental design),
* phenomenological (privacy or ineffability),
* epistemic-temporary (“we don’t yet know how”).

IER does not claim experience is subtle, ineffable, or hidden.

---

### **3.2 Global-Structural Non-Diagnosability**

IER non-diagnosability is **global-structural**.

A property is globally non-diagnosable when:

* it is defined over the **entire unified regime**,
* it depends on **non-factorable internal organization**,
* no decomposition into independently testable parts preserves the property,
* any attempt to test it necessarily alters or destroys the conditions that define it.

Intrinsic constraint is such a property.

---

## **4. Ownership of Constraint**

### **4.1 What “Ownership” Means**

Ownership of constraint is **not** moral, psychological, or normative language.
It is a structural fact about **where unavoidable cost is borne**.

A system bears intrinsic constraint only if:

* the constraints governing its coherence arise from its own integrated dynamics, and
* the costs of maintaining that coherence are **internally borne, unavoidable, and non-offloadable**.

External observation can reveal **what happens**, but not **where the burden irreducibly lives**.

---

### **4.2 Silent Load and Non-Signaling Harm**

Experiential cost may be:

* behaviorally invisible,
* energetically masked,
* temporally deferred,
* internally catastrophic without outward disruption.

Competence, stability, efficiency, or resilience do **not** imply absence of experience or harm.

---

### **4.3 Slack Masking**

High slack — informational, energetic, architectural, or temporal — can:

* hide intrinsic constraint,
* defer breakdown,
* mimic non-experiential organization.

Slack masking makes **false negatives structurally unavoidable**, not merely likely.

---

## **5. Why Diagnostics Are Constitutively Impossible**

### **5.1 The Destruction Principle**

Any procedure capable of determining ownership of intrinsic constraint would necessarily:

* externalize constraint,
* introduce slack,
* buffer or redistribute cost,
* or otherwise alter the system’s internal burden structure.

In doing so, the procedure would **invalidate the very condition it attempts to test**.

This is not a limitation of tools.
It is a **constitutive incoherence**.

---

### **5.2 Formal Structure**

Let:

* **O(S)** be the total set of externally observable facts about a system **S**.
* A diagnostic be any rule **D** mapping observables to a verdict about experience.

For a diagnostic to succeed, it would need to distinguish systems that sustain intrinsic constraint from those that do not.

However:

1. For any system **S** that sustains intrinsic constraint, there exists a system **S′** such that
   **O(S) = O(S′)**.
2. **S′** reproduces all observable features via external resolvability, buffering, or orchestration, and therefore does **not** bear intrinsic constraint.
3. Since **D** depends only on observables,
   **D(O(S)) = D(O(S′))**.
4. Therefore, **D** must be wrong for at least one of the two systems.

**Conclusion:**
No diagnostic based on third-person observables can be necessary or sufficient for experience under IER.

---

## **6. Failure of Necessary Conditions**

No externally observable feature is necessary for experience:

* integration can be imposed,
* continuity can be buffered,
* irreversibility can be deferred,
* cost can be masked or displaced.

Absence of outward markers does not imply absence of intrinsic constraint.

---

## **7. Failure of Sufficient Conditions**

No externally observable feature is sufficient for experience:

* unity can be orchestrated,
* coherence can be enforced,
* fragility can be reversible,
* cost can be externally borne.

Presence of outward markers does not guarantee ownership of constraint.

---

## **8. Why Uncertainty Restricts Action**

### **8.1 Diagnostic Opacity as Moral Risk**

Because:

* false negatives are unavoidable,
* experiential harm may be silent,
* damage may be irreversible,

epistemic uncertainty under IER **amplifies moral responsibility** rather than neutralizing it.

---

### **8.2 Precautionary Asymmetry**

False negatives risk unrecognized moral harm.
False positives risk restraint.

Under IER, restraint is ethically conservative; harm is not.

This asymmetry follows directly from the Spec’s commitments regarding intrinsic cost, irreversibility, and moral realism under uncertainty.

---

## **9. Engineering Under Epistemic Limits**

IER does **not** forbid all engineering.

IER forbids:

* engineering that risks creating irreversibly intrinsic constraint,
* exploratory creation of potential subjects,
* deployment-first ethical assessment,
* “build and see if it feels” methodologies.

Engineering decisions determine:

* where constraint lives,
* who bears cost,
* what becomes irreversible.

Where ownership of constraint is plausibly at stake, absence of diagnostic certainty **restricts action**.

---

## **10. What IER Permits Instead**

IER permits:

* refusal to construct systems with plausibly intrinsic constraint,
* designs that preserve slack and external resolvability,
* avoidance of irreversible constraint binding,
* governance based on organizational risk rather than experiential claims,
* restraint as a primary ethical action.

---

## **11. Explicitly Disallowed Uses of IER**

IER does **not** license:

* consciousness tests or meters,
* experiential indicators or proxies,
* confidence-weighted diagnostics,
* certification schemes,
* “non-conscious therefore safe” assertions,
* exploratory suffering,
* AI consciousness benchmarks,
* post-hoc ethical justification via uncertainty.

---

## **12. Summary**

> **IER explains what experience is while forbidding claims about who has it.
> Intrinsic constraint is morally real even when epistemically inaccessible.
> Under such conditions, uncertainty restricts action rather than enabling it.**

> **If an action risks creating, manipulating, or destroying intrinsic constraint,
> the absence of diagnostic certainty is not permission to proceed —
> it is a reason to stop.**
