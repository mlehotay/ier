## **Orientation: When the System Acts Without Anyone There**

Sleep actions are unsettling because they violate a deep assumption:

> **If something was done, someone must have done it.**

People sleepwalk, cook meals, send messages, drive cars, and sometimes seriously injure themselves or others—only to wake with no memory, no intention, and no sense of authorship. These cases feel morally and conceptually uncomfortable because ordinary frameworks quietly equate:

* action with intention
* intention with awareness
* awareness with experience

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) rejects this entire chain.

This article explains **how coordinated action can occur without agency**, sometimes **without experience at all**, and why this does *not* require unconscious selves, degraded subjects, or partial consciousness. Experiential boundary failures without action are treated separately in *IER-parasomnias.md*. Here, the focus is **what the system does**, not what it feels like.

## **1. Action Is Not Agency**

In everyday language, *doing* and *choosing* are treated as the same thing. IER separates them structurally.

Under IER:

* **Action** is coordinated physical resolution over time
* **Agency** is owned resolution under intrinsic constraint
* **Experience** exists only when a Unified Experiential Field (UEF) is instantiated

These are distinct facts about a system. Sleep actions pull them apart in ways that ordinary waking life rarely does.

A system can resolve trajectories—move, navigate, manipulate—without owning those resolutions. Action is cheap. Ownership is not.

## **2. Sleep as a Generator of Action Without Ownership**

Sleep is uniquely suited to producing action without agency because it involves **regime switching**.

Across the night, the same physical system moves through states that differ in:

* global integration
* participation patterns
* constraint ownership

Some regimes sustain a UEF. Others do not. Crucially, motor coordination can remain viable even when global intrinsic constraint fails to instantiate. This makes sleep a natural environment for **resolution without authorship**.

Sleep actions do not occur *within* a single state of “being asleep.” They occur **across unstable regime boundaries**.

## **3. Fully Automatic Sleep Actions**

Some sleep actions are entirely non-experiential.

Examples include:

* snoring
* postural adjustments
* reflexive limb movements
* simple vocalizations

These behaviors arise from:

* local control loops
* brainstem and spinal coordination
* biomechanical dynamics

No Unified Experiential Field is present. No subject exists. These actions establish the floor case: **coordination without experience**.

Nothing about these behaviors implies intention, awareness, or ownership. They are organism-level events, not experiential ones.

## **4. Coordinated Action Without Subjecthood**

More disturbing cases involve **complex coordination** without a subject at all.

Sleepwalking and related behaviors can include:

* navigation through familiar spaces
* obstacle avoidance
* object manipulation
* multi-step task completion

These actions often look intentional from the outside. Under IER, they are not.

Structurally:

* the physical system persists
* motor and spatial programs remain active
* no UEF is instantiated
* no subject exists to own resolution

This is not divided consciousness, unconscious agency, or a second self. It is **action without subjecthood**.

The system acts. No one does.

## **5. Drug-Induced Sleep Actions**

Certain hypnotic drugs reliably produce dramatic sleep actions: cooking, eating, driving, texting, shopping. These cases are often explained away as amnesia.

IER rejects this explanation.

The defining feature is **regime destabilization**:

* motor participation persists
* environmental coupling remains
* global intrinsic constraint does not re-form

Resolution occurs, but it is not owned. Amnesia affects later reporting, not contemporaneous structure.

Pharmacologically induced sleep actions are structurally identical to spontaneous sleepwalking: **resolution without agency**, sometimes **without experience**.

## **6. Why Memory Is Not the Explanation**

A common response to sleep actions is: *“It doesn’t count because they don’t remember it.”*

Under IER, this move fails.

* Memory is not an identity condition
* Memory is not required for experience
* Memory absence does not erase harm or risk

What matters is **where intrinsic constraint was borne at the time**, not whether the system later re-enters that region of participation. Memory explains narratives. It does not explain action.

---

## **7. Responsibility, Harm, and Sleep Actions**

Sleep actions are morally troubling because they combine:

* real-world effects
* absence of agency
* absence of ownership

IER allows all three to coexist.

Experiential standing does not scale with agency. Responsibility can be limited without erasure. Harm can occur without blame. Legal liability frameworks may still apply, but they do not imply authorship.

IER blocks two common errors:

* **moral inflation**: treating sleep actions as chosen
* **moral erasure**: treating them as if nothing happened

Neither is structurally correct.

## **8. Short Contrast: Why Sleep Actions Stress Other Frameworks**

Sleep actions force theories to explain **coordination without awareness, ownership, or reportability**.

* **Global Workspace Theory** must posit degraded or partial broadcasting, introducing graded consciousness.
* **Higher-Order Thought theory** must invoke intelligent unconscious agency, raising the question of *who* is acting.
* **Executive or modular models** rely on offline controllers and subordinate systems, reintroducing homunculi.

IER requires none of these repairs. It distinguishes action from agency and experience from behavior from the start.

Sleep actions are not anomalies. They are confirmations.

---

## **9. What Sleep Actions Teach Us**

Sleep actions expose a simple but unsettling truth:

* Action does not imply a subject
* Agency does not require wakefulness
* Experience is neither necessary nor sufficient for behavior
* Ownership is the true pivot

A system can act coherently while no one is there to own the action.

---

## **Summary**

Sleep actions are not mysterious because they involve hidden minds or partial selves. They are revealing because they show how much of what we call “doing” never required a subject at all.

IER does not weaken subjecthood to explain these cases. It keeps subjecthood strict—and lets behavior fall where it may.

### **Intermission — Structural Fact**

> **Resolution can occur without ownership.
> Ownership can vanish without the system disappearing.
> Action was never the proof of a subject.**
