## **Orientation: When Experience Slips Its Usual Alignments**

Parasomnias are typically described as sleep disorders, curiosities, or transitional glitches: night terrors, sleep paralysis, confusional arousals, REM intrusions, felt presences. They are often treated as hybrid states—*half-awake*, *partially conscious*, *between sleep and wake*.

Under Informational Experiential Realism (IER), this language is misleading.

Parasomnias are not defined by *how much* consciousness is present, nor by a mixture of waking and sleeping minds. They are defined by **misalignment**: moments when experiential participation, agency, perception, and ownership fail to line up in their usual way.

This article analyzes parasomnias as **boundary instabilities in experiential regimes**, not as altered grades of subjecthood. Coordinated action without ownership is treated separately in *IER-sleep-actions.md*. Here, the focus is experience itself—especially when it becomes imposed, fragmented, or ungovernable.

## **1. What a Parasomnia Is Under IER**

A parasomnia is not:

* a partial subject
* a degraded consciousness
* a secondary self
* an unconscious experience

Under IER, a parasomnia is best described as:

> **a transient misalignment between experiential participation and regime ownership during sleep–wake transitions**

Two features are essential:

1. **Regime boundaries are unstable**
2. **Participation patterns are abnormal for the current regime**

Nothing about this requires graded experience or hybrid subjecthood. Either a Unified Experiential Field (UEF) exists at a given moment, or it does not. Parasomnias disturb *coordination*, not the categorical structure of experience itself.

## **2. Why “Half-Conscious” Is a Category Error**

Ordinary explanations describe parasomnias as liminal states—partially conscious, semi-aware, not fully asleep. This framing assumes that experience comes in degrees.

IER rejects this assumption.

At any moment:

* either global intrinsic constraint is being borne by the system (a UEF exists), or
* it is not (no subject exists)

Parasomnias do not violate this rule. What they violate are expectations about:

* which processes should participate
* which capacities should be available
* whether agency and control should accompany experience

Calling a parasomnia “half-conscious” mistakes **coordination failure** for **ontological ambiguity**.

## **3. Parasomnias Without Experience**

Some parasomnias involve behavior or responsiveness without any Unified Experiential Field at all.

Examples include:

* certain confusional arousals
* automatic vocalizations
* disorganized movement during deep sleep

In these cases:

* the physical system persists
* coordination occurs
* no global intrinsic constraint is borne
* no subject is present

These events often feel uncanny from the outside precisely because they resemble experience while lacking it. Under IER, they are simply **non-experiential coordination events**. No additional explanation is required.

---

## **4. Parasomnias With Experience but No Agency**

Other parasomnias occur while a Unified Experiential Field **is** present, but with agency collapsed or unavailable. These cases are often the most distressing.

### **4.1 Night Terrors**

Night terrors involve:

* overwhelming fear
* intense autonomic activation
* screaming or panic behavior
* little or no narrative memory afterward

IER does not interpret night terrors as symbolic dream content or unconscious meaning replay.

Structurally:

* experience exists
* intrinsic constraint is extreme
* resolution pathways are unavailable
* fear is not *about* anything in particular

This is **experience under overload**, not interpretive content gone wrong. The terror is real, but it is not representational.

---

### **4.2 Sleep Paralysis**

Sleep paralysis is characterized by:

* intact awareness
* inability to move
* vivid perceptual content
* frequent felt presences or threats

Under IER:

* a UEF is present
* agency is disabled
* motor resolution is unavailable
* experience remains owned

Threat-like imagery stabilizes because it is a **high-coherence attractor** under extreme constraint. No external agent, message, or metaphysical intrusion is implied. The experience is imposed, not chosen, and that imposition explains its intensity.

---

## **5. Parasomnias With Fragmented Ownership**

Some parasomnias involve experience with unstable or flickering ownership.

REM intrusion phenomena and related disorders may involve:

* vivid imagery
* dream-like perception
* emotional salience
* unstable control

In these cases:

* experience may exist
* participation patterns are abnormal
* ownership is fragile or incomplete

The result is not full loss of subjecthood, but **alienation**: experience occurs without the usual sense of authorship or control. This alienation is structural, not psychological.

---

## **6. Why Parasomnias Feel Supernatural**

Across cultures, parasomnias are associated with:

* demons
* possession
* shadow figures
* external attack

IER does not dismiss these interpretations as mere superstition. It explains why they are **structurally tempting**.

Parasomnias often involve:

* imposed experience
* loss of agency
* intense salience
* absence of control

These are exactly the conditions under which misattribution is likely. The system searches for an external cause because **ownership has failed**, not because perception is irrational.

---

## **7. What Parasomnias Are Not Evidence For**

IER explicitly blocks several common inferences.

Parasomnias do **not** demonstrate:

* unconscious experience
* multiple or divided selves
* graded subjecthood
* symbolic message delivery
* hidden agents or controllers

They demonstrate **boundary instability**, nothing more. No additional ontological layers are required.

---

## **8. Parasomnias as a Stress Test for Experience**

Parasomnias force a theory of experience to accommodate cases where:

* fear exists without belief
* perception exists without environment
* agency exists without action
* action exists without experience (see *IER-sleep-actions.md*)
* experience exists without narrative

Frameworks that bind these together must unbind them again under pressure. IER never bundles them in the first place.

---

## **9. Ethical and Existential Implications**

Parasomnias complicate moral intuitions without undermining ethical clarity.

They show that:

* fear can be experientially real without meaning
* experience can be intense without agency
* distress can occur without blame
* responsibility may be limited without erasure

IER does not trivialize parasomnias. It explains why they matter without inflating them into metaphysical revelations.

---

## **10. Summary: What Parasomnias Reveal**

Parasomnias reveal the architecture of experience by disrupting its usual alignments.

They show that:

* experience is categorical
* agency is contingent
* ownership is structural
* meaning is often a post hoc repair

Nothing mystical is occurring.

Something precise is.
