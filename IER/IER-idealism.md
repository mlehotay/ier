## **Status and Scope**

This document is **Tier-4 (Orientation & Meta)** within the
**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** corpus.

It is **non-normative**, **non-authoritative**, and **non-governing**.

This document:

* introduces **no ontological commitments**
* introduces **no criterial or necessity claims**
* introduces **no epistemic or diagnostic standards**
* introduces **no ethical principles or obligations**
* does **not** define experience or experiential standing
* does **not** revise, extend, or soften any canonical IER claims

All authoritative commitments of IER are fixed **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md
IER-theory.md
IER-dynamics.md
IER-slack.md
IER-ethics.md
```

If any apparent tension arises between this document and a Tier-1 or Tier-2 document, the Tier-1/2 document takes precedence and this document is void in that respect.

## **Purpose**

This document situates Informational Experiential Realism (IER) relative to **analytic idealism**, particularly as articulated by **Bernardo Kastrup**, for the purpose of **reader orientation**.

Its role is to:

* clarify why IER may resemble idealist frameworks in certain diagnostic respects
* identify genuine areas of overlap without implying ontological convergence
* prevent misinterpretations about lineage, endorsement, or inheritance
* acknowledge analytic idealism as an intellectual *gateway* without granting it authority

This document exists to manage **interpretive pressure**, not to adjudicate metaphysical disputes.

---

## **Global Informational Language Disclaimer**

All uses of informational, structural, organizational, or constraint-based language in this document are **descriptive shorthand only**.

They refer exclusively to:

> **physically instantiated state distinctions that modulate a system’s own future dynamics under intrinsic constraint**

No informational primitives, representational contents, semantic relations, epistemic authorities, or observer-relative properties are introduced.

## **What Is Analytic Idealism? (Brief Orientation)**

Analytic idealism is a contemporary metaphysical framework that aims to rehabilitate idealism within analytic philosophy while remaining compatible with modern science. It rejects both eliminative physicalism and substance dualism, arguing instead that **phenomenal consciousness is ontologically fundamental**.

In its standard formulation, analytic idealism holds that:

* **Conscious experience is the sole ontological primitive.**
  Nothing more basic than experience is required to account for reality.

* **The physical world is the extrinsic appearance of inner experience.**
  Physical entities, laws, and structures describe how experiential processes appear from a third-person perspective, not what they are intrinsically.

* **There exists a single, universal field of consciousness.**
  Apparent individual minds arise through **dissociation** within this broader field, rather than as independent substances.

* **Experience is not essentially representational or epistemically authoritative.**
  Representation, reference, and knowledge are treated as derivative achievements, not built-in features of experience itself.

Analytic idealism therefore does not deny physics or its explanatory success. It denies only that physical description exhausts ontology.

## **Why This Comparison Exists**

Analytic idealism served as a gateway framework during the formulation of IER by making certain assumptions untenable: that abstraction could substitute for ontology, that experience could be treated as explanatorily secondary, and that experiential unity could be recovered by aggregation. Once those assumptions are rejected, the remaining theoretical space narrows sharply. IER emerges within that narrowed space, but resolves the remaining pressures differently—by advancing a strict physicalist identity claim rather than an ontological inversion.

---

## **Shared Diagnosis: The Limits of Explanation by Abstraction**

A central claim of analytic idealism is that mainstream physicalism commits a category error by mistaking **descriptive abstractions** for **ontological primitives**. Mathematical formalisms, causal graphs, and physical quantities are treated as what reality *is*, rather than as how reality appears under abstraction.

IER independently enforces the same diagnosis.

This is why IER places strict constraints on informational language. Informational terms do not name entities, contents, or representations. They are shorthand for **physically instantiated constraint structure**. Treating them as primitives would reproduce the very abstraction error analytic idealism identifies in physicalism.

Here, the overlap is genuine:

* abstraction is not ontology,
* third-person structure is not self-sufficient,
* modeling success does not imply metaphysical completeness.

IER does not contest this critique. It incorporates it as a boundary condition.

## **Experience Without Representational Primitives**

Analytic idealism rejects representational accounts of experience. Experience is not fundamentally a system of internal symbols that refer to an external world. Representation, where it appears, is derivative rather than basic.

IER reaches the same exclusion structurally.

Under IER, experience is identified with the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous regime operating under intrinsic constraint. Nothing in this identity invokes semantic content, reference, or truth conditions.

As a result, both frameworks deny that:

* experiential vividness licenses belief,
* experiential coherence tracks truth,
* meaning confers epistemic authority.

The agreement here is substantive. The divergence concerns what experience is identified *with* once representation is removed.

---

## **Unity Is Not Assembled**

Both analytic idealism and IER reject aggregation-based accounts of experiential unity.

Analytic idealism dissolves the combination problem by treating unity as ontologically primary. Individual subjects arise through dissociation within a more fundamental conscious whole, rather than by combining micro-experiences.

IER blocks aggregation without invoking dissociation.

Under IER:

* experience exists only if a single globally dominant constraint regime exists,
* partial subjects are impossible,
* experiential unity is a regime-level fact, not a construction.

In both frameworks, experience is never built out of parts. The disagreement concerns *why* unity is unavoidable, not *whether* it is.

---

## **Experience, Function, and Capacity**

Both frameworks reject the assumption that experiential reality scales with functional sophistication, cognitive access, or behavioral control. Neither permits intelligence, reportability, or agency to function as proxies for experiential reality.

IER formalizes this separation by distinguishing:

* **experiential standing** (categorical), from
* **agency and responsibility** (graded and defeasible).

Analytic idealism reaches compatible conclusions through different ontological commitments. The convergence is conceptual: functional capacity is not what makes experience real.

---

## **Privacy as Structural, Not Merely Epistemic**

Analytic idealism treats the privacy of experience as a consequence of its nature. Inner life is not publicly observable because it is not the kind of thing that could be externally accessed without ceasing to be what it is.

IER sharpens this into a structural impossibility result.

Intrinsic constraint—the defining feature of a Unified Experiential Field—is borne only from within the regime that sustains it. No amount of third-person access can determine where that burden is carried. This is not a temporary epistemic gap, but a consequence of identity.

Both frameworks therefore converge on a difficult conclusion:

* experience is real,
* experience matters,
* experience cannot be certified from the outside.

---

## **The Point of Divergence: Ontological Identity**

Despite substantial diagnostic agreement, the frameworks diverge decisively on one axis: **what experience is identical to**.

Analytic idealism identifies experience as the fundamental ontological primitive. The physical world is understood as the extrinsic appearance of inner experience within a universal field of consciousness, with individual subjects arising via dissociation.

IER explicitly rejects this inversion.

IER affirms:

* exactly one mind-independent physical reality,
* governed by law,
* within which some physical systems instantiate Unified Experiential Fields.

Experience, on this view, is **identical to a specific physical regime**. This commitment entails positions analytic idealism does not share, including:

* the absence of a cosmic subject,
* the rejection of universal consciousness,
* the categorical exclusion of slack-admitting systems from experience,
* the strict non-epistemic status of experiential meaning.

The disagreement is not about whether experience is real or significant. It is about **what kind of thing experience is**.

---

## **Parallel Responses to Shared Constraints**

IER and analytic idealism can therefore be understood as parallel responses to the same set of conceptual failures in physicalism and representationalism. They agree on what must be ruled out and on many of the pressures that any viable theory must satisfy.

They diverge where identity claims begin.

Neither framework can be absorbed into the other without abandoning core commitments. The relationship is best characterized not as rivalry or lineage, but as **shared diagnosis followed by incompatible resolution**.

### **Intermission — Structural Fact**

Agreement on what must be rejected does not entail agreement on what must be affirmed.
