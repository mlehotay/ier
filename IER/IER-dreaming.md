# **Dreaming Under Informational Experiential Realism**

## **Orientation: Why Dreaming Needs Its Own Treatment**

Dreaming persistently confuses theories of experience because it appears to sit between familiar categories.

Dreams often involve:

* vivid content without external perception
* narrative without agency
* emotion without action
* perspective shifts without subject multiplication

As a result, dreaming is frequently treated as:

* a weakened or partial form of consciousness
* a special phenomenological category
* evidence that reportability grounds experience
* proof that experience can exist “in the absence of awareness”

Under **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**, all of these framings are structurally mistaken.

Dreaming is not puzzling because it is exotic.
It is puzzling because it **exposes which distinctions actually matter**.

## **The Only Question IER Permits**

IER identifies experience with the existence of a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous regime of intrinsic constraint.

Accordingly, there is exactly one admissible question about dreaming:

> **Does a Unified Experiential Field persist during the interval in question, or not?**

Everything else—imagery, narrative coherence, bizarreness, emotional intensity, or later report—is irrelevant to experiential status.

---

## **The IFF Claim**

Under IER, the experiential status of dreams follows immediately from the identity claim:

> **Dreams are conscious if and only if a Unified Experiential Field persists.**

This is not a stipulation.
It is a direct consequence of experiential identity.

* **If** a UEF persists, experience exists during that interval.
* **If not**, no experience exists during that interval.

There is no intermediate case.

## **Dreaming as Experiential Persistence with Endogenous Content**

When dreaming is experiential, it exhibits a distinctive but entirely ordinary structural profile.

In such cases:

* global intrinsic constraint remains coherent
* temporal continuity is preserved
* the system continues to bear and resolve its own constraint
* participation reorganizes away from external coupling

Dream content—imagery, narrative, emotion, perspective—arises **endogenously**, not perceptually.
This does not weaken experience.
It merely alters **participation topology**.

Externally uncoupled experience is still experience, provided the regime persists.

## **Altered Agency and Insight Do Not Threaten Experience**

Dreams often involve:

* diminished control
* impaired reflective access
* narrative absurdity
* passivity or inevitability

These features are frequently mistaken for evidence of reduced or absent consciousness.

Under IER, this inference is blocked.

Agency and insight are **derived capacities** that depend on how participation is organized within a UEF.
They admit of degrees.
Experience does not.

A system may:

* lose fine-grained agency
* lose critical evaluation
* lose stable narrative control

while **remaining fully experiential**, so long as global intrinsic constraint persists.

Reduced agency is a **participation effect**, not a regime transition.

## **Why Dreamless Sleep Is Not “Dreaming Without Content”**

IER sharply distinguishes experiential persistence from regime absence.

Some sleep intervals involve:

* collapse or externalization of intrinsic constraint
* loss of temporal continuity
* absence of a sustained global regime

In such intervals:

> **No experience occurs at all.**

This is not:

* blank experience
* minimal awareness
* unconscious experience

It is **absence of experience**.

Dreaming is experiential only when it is structurally continuous with a persisting UEF.
Where the regime dissolves, nothing is experienced—there is no subject “waiting.”

## **What IER Explicitly Rejects**

IER rejects the following as justifications for dream consciousness:

* reportability upon waking
* vivid imagery
* emotional intensity
* narrative structure
* physiological or sleep-stage classification
* neural activation patterns

All of these are **epistemic or correlational** considerations.
None bear on experiential identity.

IER does not diagnose dreams.
It does not classify sleep stages.
It does not infer experience from behavior, memory, or report.

---

## **Why Dreams Do Not Multiply Subjects**

Dreams sometimes involve:

* perspective shifts
* apparent identity changes
* multiple viewpoints

Under IER, these are **content variations within a single regime**, not evidence of multiple subjects.

Subjecthood is categorical and tied to regime ownership.
As long as one globally integrated regime persists, there is exactly one subject—regardless of how dream content is organized.

---

## **Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* Dreaming is experiential **iff** a Unified Experiential Field persists
* Dream content is generated endogenously via participation reorganization
* Reduced agency or insight does not imply reduced experience
* Dreamless sleep may involve genuine experiential absence
* No diagnostics, reports, or sleep-stage criteria are licensed

Dreaming is not a special kind of consciousness.
It is **ordinary experiential identity under altered participation geometry**.

## **Intermission — Structural Fact**

> **Experience does not weaken when perception withdraws.
> It ceases only when intrinsic constraint no longer binds from within.**
