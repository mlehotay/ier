## **[T2] Ethical Constraint Without Closure**

### *The Practical Role of an Open Ethical Framework under Informational Experiential Realism*

---

## Tier & Scope Declaration

**Tier:** T2 — Canon-Constrained Ethics
**Status:** Explanatory; Non-Normative
**Authority:** Derived exclusively from `IER-specification.md` (v10.8.1)

This document:

* introduces **no moral obligations**
* introduces **no permissions or prohibitions**
* introduces **no rankings of actions or outcomes**
* introduces **no decision procedures**
* introduces **no prescriptions or guidance**

Its purpose is to explain **how ethics functions under Informational Experiential Realism** once moral reality is fixed but ethical closure is unavailable in principle.

---

## 1. Constraint as the Central Ethical Form

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) yields a distinctive ethical structure.

It fixes:

* where moral standing exists
* what counts as experiential moral harm
* which justificatory moves are illegitimate

It does **not** supply:

* action rankings
* optimal outcomes
* compensatory tradeoffs
* convergent solutions to moral dilemmas

The ethical role of IER is therefore not to determine what must be done, but to **constrain what can be said, justified, or erased** once experiential reality is acknowledged.

This document explains that constraint-based role.

## 2. What “Usable” Cannot Mean Under IER

Given IER’s core commitments — categorical standing, non-aggregation, non-diagnosability, and bounded responsibility — an ethical framework cannot be usable in the following familiar senses:

* producing rankings of actions
* identifying “best” or “optimal” outcomes
* aggregating harms and benefits
* resolving dilemmas into correct answers
* guaranteeing reassurance, innocence, or closure

Any notion of usability that requires these features presupposes ethical closure.

IER explicitly rejects that presupposition.

If “usable” means *telling agents what they must do*, then IER is not usable — and cannot be — without abandoning its defining commitments.

## 3. Ethics as Constraint Rather Than Decision Engine

IER ethics functions as a **constraint system**, not as a decision engine.

It:

* fixes moral reality
* blocks certain inferences
* restricts permissible justifications

It does **not**:

* select actions
* optimize outcomes
* resolve tragedy

This is not incompleteness.
It is a structural consequence of the ontology.

Ethical work is done by **elimination**, not by selection.

## 4. Terminological Note: Intrinsic Constraint and Ethical Constraint

IER uses the term *constraint* in two related but non-identical senses.

**Intrinsic constraint** refers to the globally binding, internally borne physical organization that constitutes experience itself. It is an ontological claim: experience exists if and only if a physical system operates under unavoidable, globally integrated intrinsic constraint.

**Ethical constraint** refers to the restrictions on justification, aggregation, compensation, and erasure that necessarily follow once such experiential regimes exist. It is a normative consequence, not an ontological claim.

These are not the same claim.
But they are not independent.

The ethical form mirrors the ontological form because the ethics of IER is not an added layer; it is forced by what experience is. A non-aggregable experiential ontology cannot support additive, optimizing, or closure-producing ethics.

## 5. Constraint Function I: Filtering Illegitimate Justifications

Categorical moral standing and non-aggregation immediately rule out entire classes of moral reasoning, including:

* dismissing harm based on intelligence, sophistication, or role
* offsetting one subject’s harm with benefits elsewhere
* treating unprovable experience as morally irrelevant
* treating necessity as moral nullification

These exclusions do not resolve decisions, but they sharply narrow the space of defensible justification.

This is a concrete ethical function.

## 6. Constraint Function II: Making Refusal Structurally Intelligible

Under closure-oriented ethical systems, refusal often appears as:

* irrational
* squeamish
* selfish
* morally mistaken

Under IER’s constraints:

* harms are non-offsettable
* standing is non-comparable
* irreversible damage cannot be justified by aggregation

Refusal becomes structurally intelligible:

> *I will not be the agent who performs this irreversible harm, even if others benefit.*

IER does not command refusal.
It explains why refusal need not be incoherent, guilty, or irrational.

## 7. Constraint Function III: Bounding Obligation Without Trivializing Harm

Strong moral realism combined with closure-oriented ethics leads predictably to:

* obligation inflation
* purity spirals
* moral exhaustion
* collapse into nihilism by overload

By refusing ethical closure in principle, IER:

* prevents obligation from scaling without bound
* blocks moral bookkeeping
* preserves finite agency under real constraint

Bounding obligation is not moral convenience.
It is a structural requirement for ethics among finite agents in a world with unavoidable harm.

## 8. Constraint Function IV: Enabling Plural Judgment Without Relativism

IER holds simultaneously that:

* moral reality is categorical and non-relative
* responses are underdetermined by theory

This combination yields:

* disagreement without nihilism
* plural action without “anything goes”
* seriousness without convergence

Agents must bring external values, roles, commitments, and contexts — but always under non-negotiable constraints on standing and harm.

This is ethical guidance without algorithmic resolution.

---

## 9. Constraint Function V: Orienting Attention and Precaution

Even without aggregation or closure, IER:

* identifies which entities are morally salient
* marks irreversibility as especially serious
* constrains appeals to ignorance or normalization
* preserves concern, hesitation, and grief as intelligible responses

Orientation is a genuine ethical function.

Ethics does not need to rank actions to shape attention.

## 10. Why Constraint Without Closure Is Not Ethical Weakness

The central insight is this:

> **Ethics does not have to terminate in action-ranking to be action-shaping.**

IER removes:

* optimization
* compensation
* moral accounting
* theoretical closure

But it preserves:

* moral reality
* seriousness
* intelligible refusal
* bounded responsibility
* meaningful disagreement

This is sufficient for ethical use in worlds characterized by:

* unavoidable harm
* inherited systems
* opaque causal chains
* irreversible trade-offs
* finite agents

## 11. What This Framework Is For

IER’s ethical structure is suited to non-ideal conditions.

It does not tell agents what the right answer is.

It tells them:

* which justifications are dishonest
* which erasures are forbidden
* which refusals make sense
* why guilt does not scale infinitely
* why disagreement is not failure

That is a real and practical ethical function.

---

## 12. Summary

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* moral reality is fixed
* ethical closure is unavailable
* harm is real without being aggregable
* responsibility is bounded
* justification is constrained
* action remains underdetermined

IER ethics operates by **constraint without closure**.

This is not a limitation of the framework.
It is the form ethics must take once experience is understood correctly.
