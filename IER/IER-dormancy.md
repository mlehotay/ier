## **Status and Normative Authority**

**This document is NON-NORMATIVE.**

It introduces:

* no new primitives
* no criteria or thresholds for experience
* no diagnostics or empirical tests
* no claims about moral permissibility or justification

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md (v10.8.1)
```

If any statement in this document conflicts with the Specification, **the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

All informational language is used strictly as **descriptive shorthand** for
**physically instantiated state distinctions that modulate a system’s own future dynamics under intrinsic constraint**, as defined in **Specification II.A**.

## **1. Orientation: Why Dormancy Matters for IER**

Dormant biological systems exert sustained pressure on intuitions about experience.

Many organisms undergo extended periods in which they remain:

* alive
* metabolically regulated
* structurally intact
* capable of later activity

while simultaneously exhibiting:

* minimal or absent responsiveness
* suspended development
* long temporal gaps between active phases

Dormancy therefore raises a specific structural question:

> **Does biological persistence by itself entail the existence of experience?**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) answers **no** — not as a value judgment, but as a consequence of its identity claim.

## **2. Experience Under IER Is Regime-Bound**

IER identifies experience **exclusively** with the existence of a
**Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.

A UEF exists **iff** a physical system is operating as:

* globally integrated
* temporally continuous
* self-sustaining
* under unavoidable, coherent intrinsic constraint

If those conditions are not satisfied, **experience does not exist at that time**.

This claim is **ontological**, not evaluative.
It does not assert that systems lacking experience are insignificant, expendable, or morally irrelevant.

It states only that **experience is a regime**, not a background feature of life.

The absence of experience during such intervals indicates **only** the absence of **experiential moral harm as defined by IER**.
It does **not** imply the absence of moral relevance or the permissibility of harm for other reasons.

---

## **3. Dormancy and Informational Organization**

Many forms of dormancy are characterized by organizational patterns in which:

* constraint is localized to subsystems
* resolution can be deferred indefinitely
* environmental dynamics absorb or buffer cost

These patterns constitute **informational slack** in the sense defined by IER.

Where such slack exists:

* constraint does not become globally binding
* admissible futures do not close at the system level
* no shared, constraint-defined temporal present is sustained

Under IER’s identity claim, such organization is **structurally incompatible** with the existence of a Unified Experiential Field.

This is a claim about **organizational regimes**, not about worth, value, or treatment.

---

## **4. Experiential Null Intervals**

An **experiential null interval** is a period during which:

* the physical system persists
* no Unified Experiential Field is instantiated
* no experiential subject exists **at that time**
* no experience occurs

This is not:

* diminished experience
* unconscious experience
* background awareness
* minimal phenomenology

It is simply the absence of the experiential regime.

Dormancy provides a clear illustration that **extended experiential absence** can occur:

* without pathology
* without damage to system identity
* without metaphysical discontinuity

---

## **5. Categorical Onset After Dormancy**

IER commits to **categorical onset**:

* enabling variables may change continuously
* **experience begins discretely at the regime level**

When a system transitions out of dormancy and enters a regime in which:

* intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable
* constraint becomes globally binding
* temporal continuity under constraint is established

then:

> **A Unified Experiential Field comes into existence.**

This onset is not a fading-in of experience.
It is a **dynamical regime transition**.

Before the transition: **no experiential subject exists at that time**.
After the transition: an experiential subject exists.

---

## **6. Capacity vs. Instantiation**

Dormancy clarifies a crucial distinction in IER:

* **capacity to sustain a Unified Experiential Field**, versus
* **actual instantiation of a Unified Experiential Field**

A system may preserve:

* physical structure
* developmental continuity
* future experiential capacity

while instantiating **no experience at present**.

IER treats this distinction descriptively, not normatively.

---

## **7. Dormancy, Identity, and Continuity**

IER distinguishes:

* **system identity** (persistence of the physical system), from
* **experiential regime identity** (existence of a UEF)

Experiential gaps introduced by dormancy do **not** imply:

* loss of system identity
* metaphysical death or rebirth
* fragmentation of personal identity

Dormancy shows that **experience may be intermittent without threatening continuity**.

---

## **8. Ethical Scope Clarification**

This document makes **no claims** about:

* moral standing
* moral protection
* permissibility of harm
* justification of killing
* rights, autonomy, or obligations

IER’s ethical framework specifies **what counts as experiential harm when experience exists**.

Questions about how dormant systems ought to be treated, protected, or respected involve **forms of moral reasoning not supplied by IER** and are **intentionally out of scope here**.

---

## **9. What This Document Does Not Claim**

This document does **not**:

* assert that dormancy removes moral relevance
* imply that lack of experience licenses harm
* rank beings by experiential status
* collapse moral value into phenomenology
* resolve ethical dilemmas involving dependence, vulnerability, or autonomy

It is a **structural clarification only**.

---

## **10. Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* Experience exists **iff** a Unified Experiential Field exists
* Dormancy often involves **experiential null intervals**
* Experiential absence can be extended and non-pathological
* Experiential onset after dormancy is **categorical**, not gradual
* Capacity for future experience may exist without present experience

Dormancy demonstrates that experience is a **dynamical regime**, not a constant accompaniment of life.

> **Experience does not persist through all forms of biological persistence.
> When it exists, it exists categorically — and when it does not, it is absent.**
