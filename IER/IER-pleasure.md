## Pleasure as Coherent Intrinsic Constraint

*An explanatory account under Informational Experiential Realism (IER)*

---

## 0. Status, Scope, and Canon Position

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It introduces:

* no new ontological primitives
* no criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics
* no ethical principles, value rankings, or permissions

All ontological and ethical authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

* `IER-specification.md`
* `IER-ethics.md`

This document is **paired with** `IER-pain.md`.

Where *IER-pain* explains the experiential character of **escalating and conflicting intrinsic constraint**,
this document explains the experiential character of **coherent and non-conflicting intrinsic constraint**.

The two documents are **not opposites**, do not jointly define value, and do not form a hedonic scale.

**Purpose of this document:**

> To explain **why certain experiential regimes feel good** under Informational Experiential Realism,
> without treating pleasure as value, benefit, justification, or moral currency.

## 1. Orientation: Why Pleasure Requires Its Own Treatment

Pleasure is unusually resistant to theoretical demotion.

Even after rejecting:

* utilitarianism
* hedonic aggregation
* reward-based ethics

readers often continue to treat pleasure as *counting for something*.

This persistence is not confusion or bad faith.
It follows from how pleasure presents itself from within experience.

Pleasure feels permissive, stabilizing, and affirming.
It often feels like evidence that things are “going well.”

IER’s task is not to deny this feeling, but to **explain it without endorsing it**.

## 2. What Pleasure Is *Not* Under IER

Before explaining pleasure, IER blocks several common imports.

Under Informational Experiential Realism, pleasure is **not**:

* a reward signal
* an evolutionary incentive *in the experiential sense*
* a value primitive
* evidence of benefit
* a compensatory good
* a justification for action
* a counterweight to harm

Questions about harm, suffering, urgency, and damage are addressed **exclusively** in `IER-pain.md`.

## 3. Valence as Constraint Geometry (Positive Side Only)

IER treats valence **descriptively**, not evaluatively.

Within a Unified Experiential Field (UEF):

* **Positive valence** corresponds to
  intrinsic constraint that is **coherent, non-conflicting, and smoothly borne**.

Valence tracks **how constraint is organized**, not what matters or what should be pursued.

Once a UEF exists, some valence is unavoidable.
Constraint always has a felt direction.

### Example: Background Comfort

Mild physical comfort often goes unnoticed:

* sitting in a supportive chair
* lying on a soft surface
* ambient warmth

Structurally:

* constraint is present
* participation is stable
* no escalation or urgency is required

This is pleasure without salience, meaning, or importance.

---

## 4. Why Coherent Constraint Feels Good

This is the core explanatory claim.

Intrinsic constraint can be borne in many ways.
When it is borne **coherently**, experience feels good.

Coherent intrinsic constraint is characterized by:

* stable participation
* low fragmentation pressure
* absence of internal conflict
* non-urgent futures

The “good feeling” is not an added signal or annotation.

> It **is** what this organization is like from the inside.

### Example: Warm Shower

A warm shower:

* smooths interoceptive signals
* reduces autonomic noise
* flattens constraint gradients

Nothing is achieved.
No value is produced.
The pleasure is simply the experiential character of constraint settling into coherence.

## 5. Participation Geometry and Pleasure Diversity

Pleasure is **not scalar**.

Different pleasures feel different because they involve different **participation geometries**, not because some contain more value than others.

### Narrow-Participation Pleasures

Examples:

* warmth
* soft textures
* gentle rocking
* slow breathing

These involve:

* limited recruitment
* low intensity
* minimal urgency

### Broad-Participation Pleasures

Examples:

* music
* dancing
* absorbed conversation
* shared laughter

These involve:

* wide recruitment across sensory, affective, and attentional processes
* stable global coherence
* increased intensity without conflict

IER explains qualitative diversity without ranking or optimization.

---

## 6. High-Intensity Pleasure Without Escalation

High intrinsic constraint usually escalates into conflict.
When it does not, experience can become unusually intense without becoming aversive.

Pleasure arises when:

* constraint is strong
* participation is global
* escalation remains **permitted and coherent**

### Example: Sexual Arousal

Sexual arousal involves:

* rising intrinsic constraint
* near-total participation
* narrowed futures

Crucially:

* the constraint is not treated as threat
* fragmentation pressure remains low

The pleasure is the felt character of **safe intensity**, not reward.

## 7. Orgasm as Resolution, Not Maximization

Orgasm is often misdescribed as “maximum pleasure.”

Under IER, orgasm is better understood as:

> **A rapid, irreversible resolution of a tightly constrained but coherent experiential regime.**

Structurally:

* constraint spikes
* futures collapse
* participation sheds
* coherence resets

### Example: Orgasm

This explains why orgasm:

* is brief
* resists extension
* cannot be sustained
* requires rebuilding constraint for repetition

The intensity comes from **forced resolution**, not accumulation of value.

## 8. Pleasure, Relief, and Joy (Positive Regimes Only)

These states are frequently conflated.
IER distinguishes them structurally.

* **Relief**
  The felt signature of constraint release.

* **Pleasure**
  The felt signature of constraint coherence.

* **Joy**
  Sustained, low-conflict coherence across time with non-urgent futures.

### Examples

* Relief: removing tight shoes
* Joy: a calm, demand-free afternoon

None of these imply moral benefit or justification.

---

## 9. Pleasure and Meaning (Epistemic Non-Authority)

Pleasure often *feels* meaningful.

This feeling is structural.

Pleasure commonly involves:

* maximal coherence
* simplified identity
* narrowed futures without threat

These features mimic the felt profile of meaning.

### Example: Afterglow After Sex or Music

The clarity and unity feel significant.
Under IER:

* no truth is revealed
* no value is discovered
* no justification is conferred

> **Experiential coherence confers no epistemic or moral authority.**

---

## 10. Why Evolutionary Stories Are Insufficient

Evolutionary narratives explain why certain organizations recur.
They do not explain why those organizations feel the way they do.

Feeling is not a functional label.
It is the identity of the regime itself.

### Example: Non-Instrumental Pleasures

* rhythmic fidgeting
* sensory stimming
* repetition without obvious payoff

IER explains these structurally, without appeal to hidden value.

---

## 11. Ethical Boundary (Deferred and Minimal)

IER explicitly accepts that:

* pleasure may be morally neutral
* pleasure may coexist with harm
* pleasure does not justify or compensate

Detailed treatment of harm, suffering, and urgency is given in `IER-pain.md`.

---

## 12. Summary

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* Pleasure is the experiential character of **coherent intrinsic constraint**
* It is real, structured, and physically grounded
* It is **not** value, benefit, or justification
* It carries **no moral or epistemic authority**

Pleasure matters **as experience**.
It does not matter **as currency**.
