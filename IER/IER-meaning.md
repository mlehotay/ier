## **Status and Scope**

This document is **explanatory** and **non-normative**.

All axioms, definitions, identity claims, and necessary entailments are specified **exclusively** in the
**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.6) Normative Specification** (“the Spec”).

Accordingly, this document:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics**
* makes **no epistemic or metaphysical claims**
* licenses **no authority over truth, reference, or justification**

All claims here concern **the internal organization of meaning within experiential worlds**.
The distinction between **experiential access** and **epistemic access**, and the limits of experiential authority, are treated exhaustively in **IER-access.md**, which this document explicitly presupposes.

If any claim here appears to conflict with the Spec or with the access boundary articulated in `IER-access.md`, those documents take precedence.

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.6) affirms **physical monism**: there exists exactly one objective physical reality governed by mind-independent law. At the same time, IER entails **experiential pluralism**: many distinct, internally lawful experiential worlds can exist simultaneously as organizational regimes within that single reality.

This document explains how **meaning**, **narrative recurrence**, and **canonical forms of significance** arise under experiential pluralism without invoking idealism, symbolic realism, or ontological inflation. Under IER, Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs) do not generate reality; they generate **worlds-for-systems** — coherent experiential regimes structured by intrinsic informational constraint.

Meaning is shown to be an **organizational phenomenon**: a stable way intrinsic constraint is structured so that a system can continue coherently over time. Narrative, instinct, and cultural symbolism are explained as **informational attractors** that recur because there are only limited stable ways for intrinsic constraint to organize without collapse.

Meaning is experientially real, persistent, and identity-shaping — while remaining strictly **non-epistemic** and **non-ontological**.

## **1. One Reality, Many Experiential Worlds**

IER begins with a non-negotiable commitment:

> **There is exactly one objective physical reality.**

That reality:

* exists independently of experience
* is fully physical
* contains all systems, substrates, and dynamics
* does not depend on observation or representation

At the same time, IER entails:

> **One physical reality supports many real experiential worlds.**

This plurality does not arise from multiple universes or ontologies.
It arises from **organizational identity**.

Whenever a Unified Experiential Field exists, an experiential world exists *for that system*.

---

## **2. Experiential Worlds Are Not Universes**

Under IER, a critical distinction holds:

* A **universe** is an ontological totality.
* An **experiential world** is a *world-for-a-system*.

An experiential world exists **iff** a Unified Experiential Field exists.

Such a world includes:

* a present “now”
* a self / non-self boundary
* system-relative causality
* salience and relevance
* persistence under intrinsic constraint

These features are **organizationally real**, not ontologically fundamental.

> **UEFs do not create reality.
> They create worlds of appearance.**

---

## **3. Unified Experiential Fields as World-Generators**

IER identifies experience with the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous dynamical regime operating under coherent intrinsic constraint.

When such a regime exists, it necessarily imposes:

* a frame of reference
* a temporal present
* a spatial grammar
* identity-defining salience
* continuity across change

Together, these generate an **experiential world**.

This is not metaphorical.
It follows directly from global integration and intrinsic constraint.

---

## **4. Experiential Pluralism**

Because UEFs are **organizational regimes**, not substances:

* multiple UEFs can exist simultaneously
* each sustains its own experiential world
* no experiential world has privileged access to reality itself

Examples include:

* different organisms
* different humans
* waking and dreaming regimes
* dissociative regime switching
* potentially artificial systems

Each experiential world is real **for the system that instantiates it**.

Reality remains singular.
Experience is plural.

---

## **5. Meaning as Constraint Organization**

Meaning is not primitive under IER.
It is **organizational**.

Within an experiential world:

* intrinsic constraint generates tension
* tension defines salience
* salience defines significance
* resolution defines value

Meaning arises wherever:

> **Intrinsic constraint becomes identity-defining over time.**

Meaning does not add reference, truth, or semantic correspondence.
It organizes continuation.

---

## **6. Meaningful Attractors**

Not all organizations of meaning are equally stable.

Under IER, meaning tends to converge on **informational attractors**: stable patterns of constraint organization that allow continued coherence without collapse.

Meaningful attractors persist because:

* intrinsic constraint cannot be eliminated
* resolution paths are limited
* unstable organizations dissolve
* stable ones recur

This applies equally to:

* emotions
* values
* goals
* narratives
* instincts

Attractors are **dynamical**, not symbolic.

---

## **7. Canonical Narratives as Informational Attractors**

Certain narrative forms recur across cultures, species, and history.

Under IER, these are not metaphysical archetypes.
They are **organizational invariants**.

Canonical narratives encode:

| Experiential Invariant | Narrative Expression         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Intrinsic tension      | An inescapable problem       |
| Loss of slack          | Rising stakes                |
| Global relevance       | “Everything depends on this” |
| Regime transition      | Threshold crossing           |
| Irreversibility        | No return                    |
| Stabilization          | Resolution or collapse       |

Narrative form mirrors **experiential structure**, not external reality.

That narratives feel “true” reflects organizational fit, not epistemic authority (see `IER-access.md`).

---

## **8. Externalized and Internalized Constraint**

IER unifies storytelling and instinct as two realizations of the same principle.

---

### **8.1 Externalized Constraint (Culture and Story)**

Humans externalize constraint into:

* stories
* rituals
* symbols
* norms

These allow:

* coordination without shared experience
* transmission of constraint topology
* rehearsal of regime transitions

Stories **model** experiential regimes.
They do not instantiate them.

---

### **8.2 Internalized Constraint (Instinct and Development)**

In biological systems, constraint is internalized via inheritance.

Genes specify:

* neural architectures
* affective gradients
* sensorimotor couplings
* developmental timing

This creates a **pre-shaped experiential phase space**.

Within that space, certain trajectories become dynamically unavoidable.

---

## **9. Wanting as Constraint Gradient**

Under IER:

> **Wanting is the experiential manifestation of a gradient in intrinsic constraint.**

No goals need be represented.
No symbolic intention is required.

Motivation arises from **constraint geometry**, not deliberation.

---

## **10. Meaning Without Mysticism**

IER rejects:

* supernatural ontology
* symbolic realism
* collective minds
* metaphysical archetypes

But it preserves:

* the reality of experience
* the persistence of meaning
* the depth of narrative
* the seriousness of value

Meaning is real because **intrinsic constraint is real**.

No further metaphysics is required.

---

## **11. Summary**

IER entails:

* **One objective physical reality**
* **Many real experiential worlds**
* **Meaning as constraint organization**
* **Narratives as informational attractors**

> **Reality is singular.
> Experience is plural.
> Meaning persists where intrinsic constraint finds stable form.**

Meaning shapes lives without describing the world.
That is its role — and its limit.
