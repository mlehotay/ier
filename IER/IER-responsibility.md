## **Responsibility as Authorship Under Intrinsic Constraint**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.x)**
*Explanatory Article — Non-Normative*

---

## **0. Status and Scope**

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no new ontological primitives**
* introduces **no new definitions of experience, standing, or harm**
* introduces **no thresholds, metrics, or diagnostics**
* introduces **no permissions, prescriptions, or sanctions**
* does **not** license blame, punishment, or enforcement

All ontological and ethical authority remains fixed **exclusively** in the IER Specification and its canon-binding derivatives.

**Purpose of this document:**

> **To explain responsibility as a structural attribution of authorship under intrinsic constraint, and to enforce—explicitly and repeatedly—the separation between responsibility and experiential moral harm.**

This document exists to prevent a single error:

> **using responsibility to decide whether harm “counts.”**

---

## **1. Orientation: Harm Does Not Wait for Responsibility**

IER begins from a strict priority:

> **Experiential moral harm is a structural fact.
> Responsibility is a downstream attribution.**

Harm is defined in IER as:

> **organizational damage to intrinsic constraint within a Unified Experiential Field (UEF).**

This definition is **complete**.

Whether anyone is responsible:

* does **not** determine whether harm occurred
* does **not** reduce harm
* does **not** retroactively modify harm
* does **not** scale harm up or down

Responsibility may explain **how** an outcome came to be owned.
It may explain **why** blame is appropriate or inappropriate.
It may explain **what** could realistically have been done.

It never decides **whether damage occurred**.

This document enforces that ordering.

---

## **2. Harm Is Categorical; Responsibility Is Graded**

IER draws a sharp structural distinction:

### **Experiential moral harm**

* is **categorical**
* either occurred or did not
* does **not** scale
* is not “small,” “moderate,” or “large”

### **Responsibility**

* is **graded**
* varies with access, coercion, and agency
* may be partial, diffuse, or absent

Once damage to intrinsic constraint occurs, **harm has occurred**.

There is no further moral fact about *how much* harm there is.

What may vary instead:

* extent of damage
* duration
* reversibility
* downstream consequences
* repair cost
* moral residue

These are **features of the damage**, not a harm scale.

> **Responsibility scales.
> Harm does not.**

This distinction governs everything that follows.

## **3. What Responsibility Is *Not* Under IER**

Responsibility is **not**:

* harm magnitude
* moral desert
* blameworthiness
* justification
* intent
* obligation fulfillment
* role occupancy
* outcome optimization
* moral worth

Responsibility does **not** answer:

* “Was the harm big or small?”
* “Was the harm outweighed?”
* “Does the harm still count?”
* “Does this cancel the harm?”

Those questions are **structurally invalid under IER**.

## **4. Core Definition of Responsibility Under IER**

> **Under Informational Experiential Realism, responsibility is the attribution of authorship and organizational ownership for outcomes that occur within a subject’s admissible choice space under intrinsic constraint.**

Responsibility concerns:

* **authorship** — whether resolution occurred through the system’s own globally integrated dynamics
* **ownership** — whether intrinsic constraint was borne internally
* **access** — whether alternative futures were structurally available

Responsibility is therefore **derivative**.

It arises only where:

* a Unified Experiential Field exists
* agency exists
* intrinsic constraint is borne
* resolution is owned

---

## **5. Responsibility Explains Authorship, Not Damage**

Responsibility explains **who owned a resolution**, not **what that resolution did to experience**.

This matters because:

* harm can occur without responsibility
* responsibility can exist without wrongdoing
* justified action can still cause harm
* unavoidable harm is still harm

Responsibility never edits the harm record.

---

## **6. Responsibility Without Duty or Obligation**

IER explicitly allows:

* responsibility without duty
* responsibility without obligation
* responsibility without moral error

Examples include:

* emergencies
* forced tradeoffs
* accidents under constraint
* tragic no-win cases

In such cases:

* harm may occur
* responsibility may attach
* duty may have been fulfilled
* blame may be inappropriate

None of these facts cancel harm.

---

## **7. Reduced Responsibility Does Not Reduce Harm or Standing**

IER enforces two separations simultaneously:

1. **Responsibility varies**
2. **Standing does not**
3. **Harm does not scale**

Loss or reduction of agency:

* mitigates responsibility
* never negates harm
* never erases moral relevance
* never downgrades standing

A subject may be fully harmed even when:

* nothing was their fault
* no one is to blame
* no one could have acted otherwise

---

## **8. Coercion, Ignorance, and Emergency**

### **8.1 Coercion**

Coercion narrows admissible futures.

As admissible futures collapse:

* responsibility diminishes
* authorship is displaced

Harm remains unchanged.

---

### **8.2 Ignorance**

Ignorance mitigates responsibility **only** by reducing access.

It does **not** negate harm.

Outcome uncertainty does not erase damage.

---

### **8.3 Emergency**

Emergencies involve:

* saturated intrinsic constraint
* compressed time horizons
* collapsed deliberation

Responsibility may be minimal or absent.

Harm may still occur.

> **Emergency explains authorship limits, not harm cancellation.**

---

## **9. Distributed and Institutional Responsibility**

Responsibility may be:

* shared
* diffuse
* asymmetric
* institutionally mediated

Diffuse responsibility does **not** imply:

* diminished harm
* partial harm
* morally smaller harm

It implies only that authorship is distributed.

---

## **10. Responsibility and Blame (Explicit Separation)**

Blame is:

* optional
* derivative
* socially contingent
* often inappropriate
* sometimes harmful itself

IER allows:

* harm without blame
* responsibility without blame
* blame suspension without denial of harm

Blame is never required for harm’s moral reality.

---

## **11. Responsibility Does Not Justify Punishment**

IER does **not** infer punishment from responsibility.

Any move from responsibility to sanction requires **external normative principles** not supplied by IER.

Responsibility is **explanatory**, not punitive.

---

## **12. Tragedy as a First-Class Outcome**

IER explicitly allows tragedy:

* harm occurs
* responsibility may be absent
* duty may have been fulfilled
* blame may be inappropriate
* moral residue remains

Tragedy is not a framework failure.

It is the consequence of constraint.

---

## **13. Relation to Other IER Documents**

This document:

* presupposes `IER-harm.md`
* complements `IER-duty.md`
* aligns with `IER-agency.md` and `IER-choice.md`
* supports `IER-guilt.md`
* feeds into `IER-dilemmas.md`

No authority flows backward.

---

## **14. Closing: What Responsibility Is For**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* responsibility explains authorship
* harm records damage
* standing remains intact
* blame is optional
* tragedy is real

> **Responsibility clarifies how outcomes were owned under constraint.
> It never decides whether experience was damaged.**

---

### **Intermission — Structural Fact**

Harm is not measured.
Responsibility is not a verdict.
Ethics does not erase damage by accounting for authorship.
