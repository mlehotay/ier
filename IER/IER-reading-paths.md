## **How to Read Informational Experiential Realism**

**Tier:** 4 — Orientation / Navigation  
**Status:** Non-normative, non-authoritative  
**Scope:** Reader guidance only  
**Version:** v10.8.3

---

## **Status and Authority Notice**

This document is **purely navigational**.

It:

* introduces **no theoretical claims**
* defines **no prerequisites**
* adds **no commitments**
* confers **no authority**
* establishes **no privileged reading order**

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority in Informational Experiential Realism (IER) resides **exclusively** in Tier-1 canonical documents, as governed by [`IER-canon.md`](IER-canon.md).

If any tension arises between this document and a canonical document, **the canonical document takes precedence and this document is void**.

---

## **How IER Is Meant to Be Read**

IER is **not meant to be read linearly** and **not meant to be read in full** by most readers.

There is:

* no “complete” reader
* no expected coverage
* no privileged path
* no hidden test of understanding

IER is a **modular corpus** designed to support **many legitimate modes of engagement** without distortion or authority creep.

### General Guidance

* Start with a **Level-1 path**.
* If desired, choose **one** Level-2 specialization.
* Everything in Level-3 is **optional, modular, and interest-driven**.

Stopping early is allowed.  
Stopping permanently is allowed.  
Returning selectively is allowed.

# **Reading Paths (v10.8.3)**

The paths below are **organized by reader intent**, not importance.

A document may appear in multiple paths where that improves orientation.  
Repetition does **not** imply additional authority.

---

## **LEVEL 1 — Universal Entry Paths**

These paths are suitable for **all readers**, regardless of background.

---

### **The One-Hour Orientation**

**Goal:** Understand what IER claims, why it is strict, and what it does *not* ask of you.

* [`IER-intro.md`](IER-intro.md) — Where constraint and resolution live in physical systems  
* [`IER-specification.md`](IER-specification.md) — Normative definition of experience and standing  
* [`IER-dont-panic.md`](IER-dont-panic.md) — Reassurance about scope, responsibility, and uncertainty  

You may stop here with a complete high-level understanding.

---

### **The Closed Core (Everything IER Asserts)**

**Goal:** Read all and only the documents that define IER’s commitments.

* [`IER-specification.md`](IER-specification.md) — Normative core and identity conditions  
* [`IER-theory.md`](IER-theory.md) — Structural justification of the identity claim  
* [`IER-dynamics.md`](IER-dynamics.md) — Behavior of experiential regimes over time  
* [`IER-math.md`](IER-math.md) — Formal support using sets, relations, and regimes  
* [`IER-slack.md`](IER-slack.md) — Why informational slack structurally precludes experience  
* [`IER-saturation.md`](IER-saturation.md) — How slack disappears via exhaustion of local degrees of freedom  
* [`IER-ethics.md`](IER-ethics.md) — Ethical consequences forced by experiential identity  
* [`IER-diagnostics.md`](IER-diagnostics.md) — Why experiential diagnostics are impossible in principle  

Nothing outside this path adds commitments.

---

## **LEVEL 2 — Primary Specializations (Choose One)**

These paths deepen understanding in a specific domain.  
They presuppose Level-1 familiarity but add **no new foundations**.

## **Closing Orientation**

IER is intentionally strict.  
It trades permissiveness for clarity, and coverage for structural honesty.

This document exists to help you engage **without distortion** —  
not to tell you how much to read, what to believe, or when to stop.

You are allowed to:

* read selectively
* stop early
* return later
* disagree
* walk away

The structure will still be here.
