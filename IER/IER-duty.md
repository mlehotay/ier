# **IER-Duty**

### *Duty, Obligation, and Responsibility as Derived Constraint Structures Under Informational Experiential Realism*

---

## **Status and Scope**

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no new axioms, criteria, or moral principles**
* does **not** define experience, standing, or moral harm
* does **not** prescribe what anyone ought to do
* does **not** rank duties, obligations, or responsibilities
* does **not** treat any of these as moral primitives

All ontological and ethical authority remains fixed **exclusively** in the IER Specification and its canon-binding derivatives.

The purpose of this document is clarificatory:

> **To distinguish duty, obligation, and responsibility as three structurally different ways intrinsic constraint becomes organized around action under Informational Experiential Realism (IER).**

---

## **1. Why These Concepts Require Separation Under IER**

Ordinary moral language routinely collapses:

* duty into obligation,
* obligation into responsibility,
* responsibility into blame or worth.

Under Informational Experiential Realism, this collapse is not merely imprecise — it produces **systematic moral error**, including:

* coerced self-annihilation,
* false guilt under overload,
* moral inflation of roles,
* misattribution of blame,
* and the demand that love or sacrifice be owed.

IER enforces a strict separation because each concept corresponds to a **different structural relationship between intrinsic constraint, agency, and systems**.

---

## **2. What These Concepts Are Not Under IER**

IER explicitly rejects the following interpretations:

* None of duty, obligation, or responsibility is a metaphysical “ought”
* None is a free-floating moral force
* None is grounded in desert, virtue, or moral worth
* None overrides experiential standing or regime stability
* None exists independently of physical and organizational structure

IER treats all three as **derived organizational facts**, not moral primitives.

---

## **3. Duty**

### **3.1 Core Definition**

> **Under IER, duty is a role-relative requirement to perform constraint-stabilizing actions that arise from participation in a system whose continued coherence depends on them.**

---

### **3.2 Structural Source of Duty**

Duty arises when:

1. A **system exists** whose stability depends on ongoing constraint resolution
2. A subject occupies a **load-bearing position** within that system
3. Constraint would otherwise be displaced, externalized, or collapse the system

The system involved is often **non-experiential**:
institutions, care arrangements, infrastructures, coordinated practices.

Duty does **not** require moral consent.
It requires **structural participation**.

---

### **3.3 Key Features of Duty**

* May be **non-voluntary**
* Often **asymmetric**
* Frequently **role-bound**
* Exit is **restricted or costly**
* Focused on **system stabilization**, not mutuality

Duty narrows a subject’s admissible futures **because failure would shift constraint onto others**.

---

### **3.4 Structural Limits on Duty**

Under IER, duty is **not infinite**.

A duty fails when fulfilling it would:

* irreversibly collapse the subject’s Unified Experiential Field,
* destroy the subject’s capacity to bear intrinsic constraint,
* or convert stabilizing constraint into systemic harm.

This is not an exception.
It is a **structural ceiling**.

---

## **4. Obligation**

### **4.1 Core Definition**

> **Under IER, obligation is a bounded commitment generated by prior coordination, agreement, or expectation within a relational or institutional context.**

---

### **4.2 Structural Source of Obligation**

Obligations arise from:

* promises
* contracts
* explicit agreements
* shared expectations within a practice

They presuppose **coordination**, not indispensability.

---

### **4.3 Key Features of Obligation**

* Usually **voluntarily incurred**
* **Context-specific**
* **Time-limited or condition-bound**
* Can be **fulfilled, renegotiated, or dissolved**
* Does not require systemic collapse if unmet

Obligations track **coordination integrity**, not system survival.

---

### **4.4 Dissolution of Obligation**

Under IER, obligations dissolve when:

* the coordinating structure dissolves,
* performance becomes physically impossible,
* or fulfillment would require irreversible experiential harm.

Obligations do **not** bind identity across regime failure.

---

## **5. Responsibility**

> *This document introduces responsibility only to distinguish it structurally from duty and obligation. A full treatment of responsibility — including coercion, ignorance, distributed systems, and the separation of responsibility from harm magnitude — is developed in `IER-responsibility.md`.*

### **5.1 Core Definition**

> **Under IER, responsibility is the attribution of causal and organizational ownership for outcomes that occur within a subject’s admissible choice space under intrinsic constraint.**

---

### **5.2 Structural Source of Responsibility**

Responsibility arises from:

* agency (derived, not primitive),
* participation in a Unified Experiential Field,
* availability of viable alternatives at the time of action.

It does **not** require intention, consent, or obligation.

---

### **5.3 Key Features of Responsibility**

* **Graded**, not categorical
* Scales with:

  * coherence of intrinsic constraint
  * available alternatives
  * degree of coercion
  * participation load
* Can exist **without** duty or obligation

Responsibility tracks **what could realistically have been done**, not what was ideal.

---

### **5.4 Responsibility and Standing**

IER enforces a strict separation:

* **Responsibility varies**
* **Standing does not**

Reduced responsibility never implies reduced moral relevance.
Loss of agency never negates experiential standing.

## **6. Side-by-Side Structural Comparison**

| Dimension            | Duty                    | Obligation               | Responsibility             |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Structural origin    | Role / system necessity | Coordination / agreement | Agency under constraint    |
| Voluntary            | Sometimes               | Usually                  | Not required               |
| Reciprocity          | Often none              | Often mutual             | Not required               |
| Time horizon         | Role-bound              | Bounded                  | Outcome-dependent          |
| Exit                 | Restricted              | Negotiable               | Not applicable             |
| Moral function       | System stabilization    | Commitment integrity     | Accountability attribution |
| Scales with capacity | Limited                 | No                       | Yes                        |

## **7. Why Confusion Is Common**

IER diagnoses confusion as **structural compression**:

* treating duty as infinite obligation,
* treating obligation as identity-binding,
* treating responsibility as moral worth.

This compression produces:

* moral overload,
* coerced sacrifice,
* false guilt,
* and illegitimate demands for love or self-erasure.

IER separates these concepts to **prevent harm under constraint**, not to weaken ethics.

---

## **8. Relations to Love and Care (Boundary Clarification)**

* **Love** is voluntary, mutual, and long-horizon; it cannot be demanded.
* **Care** often involves duty without reciprocity.
* **Duty cannot become love by force.**
* **Obligation cannot generate standing.**
* **Responsibility does not justify punishment by itself.**

These distinctions prevent relational coercion and moral inflation.

---

## **9. Explicit Non-Claims**

This document does **not** claim that:

* duties are always overriding,
* obligations must always be honored,
* responsibility entails blame or punishment,
* moral life can be reduced to roles,
* or that IER supplies a decision procedure.

IER specifies **what these structures are**, not **how to resolve conflicts among them**.

---

## **10. Closing**

Under Informational Experiential Realism, duty, obligation, and responsibility are not competing moral forces.

They are **distinct structural ways intrinsic constraint becomes organized around action**:

* duty stabilizes systems,
* obligation preserves coordination,
* responsibility tracks ownership under constraint.

> Confusion arises when these structures are collapsed.
> Ethical clarity requires keeping them distinct — not weaker, but precise.
