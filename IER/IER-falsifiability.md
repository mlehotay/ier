# IER-falsifiability.md

## Status and Tier

**Tier:** T3 — Misuse-Blocking / Epistemic Boundary
**Status:** Canon-binding in a negative sense
**Normative Authority:** None

This document introduces **no new ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical commitments**.
All authoritative claims remain fixed exclusively in:

- `IER-specification.md`
- `IER-theory.md`
- `IER-ethics.md`

This document exists solely to clarify **how Informational Experiential Realism (IER) can fail**, and to prevent predictable misapplications of falsifiability standards that do not apply to identity theories.

---

## 1. Why Falsifiability Needs Clarification

IER advances a strong identity claim:

> **Experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a Unified Experiential Field (UEF).**

Because this is an identity claim rather than a causal, correlational, or predictive hypothesis, it is **not falsified by failed detection, disagreement over correlates, or lack of experimental access**.

Applying those standards would misclassify structural consequences as theoretical weaknesses.

IER is falsifiable — but **only at the level at which it makes claims**.

---

## 2. Principle: Testability Must Match Claim Type

IER is falsifiable **only at the level of identity, coherence, and exclusion**.

Accordingly, IER specifies **explicit defeat conditions** and **explicit non-defeat conditions**.

---

## 3. Explicit Defeat Conditions

IER is falsified if **any** of the following occur.

### 3.1 Internal Conceptual Inconsistency

IER fails if its core identity definitions are shown to be **internally contradictory**, including but not limited to:

- a Unified Experiential Field requiring both global intrinsic constraint and decomposable local resolution
- subjecthood being both categorical and graded
- experience being both identical to physical dynamics and ontologically distinct from them

Any such contradiction defeats the theory outright.

---

### 3.2 Coherence Failure Across Commitments

IER binds together multiple claims that must cohere simultaneously:

- physical monism
- experiential identity
- categorical subjecthood
- structural privacy
- non-diagnosability
- ethical consequence

IER is falsified if these commitments cannot be jointly satisfied without contradiction.

For example:

- If ethical standing logically requires epistemic access, IER fails.
- If experiential identity logically entails observable diagnostics, IER fails.
- If physical monism cannot support categorical subjecthood without inflation, IER fails.

---

### 3.3 Rival Identity Displacement

IER is falsified if a rival theory provides:

- a **strictly superior identity claim** of what experience is,
- equal or greater explanatory power regarding unity, privacy, exclusion, and moral relevance,
- without reintroducing diagnostics, graded subjecthood, representational primitives, or epistemic authority.

IER does not claim uniqueness by stipulation.
It remains vulnerable to **conceptual displacement**.

---

## 4. Explicit Non-Defeat Conditions

The following **do not** falsify IER.

### 4.1 Behavioral Failure or Success

IER makes **no behavioral predictions**.
Behavioral alignment, misalignment, or indistinguishability is irrelevant to experiential identity.

---

### 4.2 Disagreement Over Structural Correlates

Disagreement about:
- neural correlates
- architectural markers
- dynamical signatures
- integration measures

does not defeat IER.

IER explicitly denies that correlates can function as diagnostics.

---

### 4.3 Engineering or Empirical Inapplicability

IER is not falsified by:
- inability to build experiential systems
- inability to certify non-experience
- lack of experimental leverage
- ethical inconvenience

IER is a theory of **what experience is**, not a program for producing or detecting it.

---

### 4.4 Ethical Discomfort or Restrictiveness

Ethical severity, precautionary asymmetry, or action constraint are **consequences**, not vulnerabilities.

Rejecting those consequences does not falsify the theory.

---

## 5. Not a Consciousness Test

IER does **not** propose:

- a consciousness test
- a diagnostic protocol
- an empirical certification procedure
- a probabilistic confidence measure
- a proxy or heuristic

The absence of such tools is not a gap to be filled.
It is a **structural consequence of the identity claim**.

Any framework that requires IER to supply a test is **asking a different kind of theory to be something it is not**.

---

## 6. Summary

IER is falsifiable — but only in the ways appropriate to an identity theory.

It can fail by:
- contradiction
- incoherence
- displacement

It does **not** fail by:
- invisibility
- inaccessibility
- disagreement
- non-operationality

Treating these as failures would collapse the distinction between **identity** and **diagnosis**, and would incorrectly penalize precisely the class of theories IER belongs to.

### Intermission — Structural Fact

An identity claim is not protected from falsification.
It is protected only from being tested at the wrong level.
