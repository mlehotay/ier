# **IER-Morals: Hard Cases, Harm, and Tragic Remainder (v10.8.1)**

## *Applying Intrinsic Constraint to Moral Edge Cases*

---

## **Status and Scope**

This document is **NON-NORMATIVE**.

It introduces **no new axioms, definitions, criteria, permissions, prohibitions, or ethical principles** beyond those fixed exclusively in the:

```
Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.1) Normative Specification
```

All moral authority resides **exclusively** in the Specification.

This document exists to **apply** IER’s ethical commitments to a set of canonical *hard cases*—situations in which ordinary moral language breaks down and familiar ethical frameworks force closure.

Its purpose is to show how a **single structural account of experiential moral harm** yields clarity **without converting tragedy into moral success**.

If any interpretation here conflicts with the Specification, the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting interpretation is void.

---

## **1. Why a “Morals” Document Is Needed**

IER-ethics establishes what is morally real **under the IER framework**:

* experiential standing is categorical
* experiential moral harm is organizational
* responsibility is graded
* uncertainty strengthens obligation
* aggregation and optimization are blocked

What it does **not** do is walk through the cases people actually argue about.

Those cases matter because ordinary moral reasoning routinely conflates:

* harm and blame
* pain and damage
* consent and benefit
* intention and permissibility
* outcome and justification

IER enforces sharp separations between these concepts.
Those separations feel counterintuitive until they are **worked through concretely**.

*IER-morals* exists to do exactly that.

---

### **1.1 Scope Clarification**

This document analyzes **experiential moral harm only**, as defined by IER.

It does **not** claim that experiential harm exhausts moral harm.
It does **not** adjudicate non-experiential moral violations, legal wrongs, social injustices, or political harms.

Accordingly:

* absence of experiential moral harm ≠ moral permissibility
* presence of experiential moral harm ≠ wrongdoing or blame

IER-morals explains **what happens to experiential worlds** in hard cases.
It does not settle all-things-considered moral judgment.

This is scope discipline, not moral minimization.

---

## **2. Core Orientation: What IER Asks in Every Case**

IER evaluates moral situations by asking a single organizing question:

> **What happens to intrinsic constraint within a Unified Experiential Field (UEF), and who bears that constraint?**

Everything else—intent, symbolism, social role, narrative framing—matters only insofar as it affects:

* stabilization vs. destabilization
* reversibility vs. irreversibility
* agency exercised vs. agency overridden
* preservation vs. collapse of the UEF

This yields conclusions that are often uncomfortable, but structurally consistent.

---

## **3. Moral Harm Is Not the Opposite of Moral Benefit**

IER defines **experiential moral harm** as:

> **Destabilization, overload, fragmentation, or irreversible collapse of intrinsic constraint within a Unified Experiential Field (UEF).**

IER deliberately introduces **no corresponding primitive of “moral benefit.”**

This is not an omission. It is a consequence of identity.

Intrinsic constraint is not a quantity to be increased or optimized.
It is a condition that must be **maintained within a coherent window**.

Actions may:

* avoid experiential harm
* mitigate experiential harm
* restore experiential stability
* prevent experiential collapse

But no action generates moral “credit” that cancels, offsets, or erases experiential harm.

This blocks:

* utilitarian tradeoffs
* moral arithmetic
* harm justification by appeal to net good

The cases below illustrate how this asymmetry functions.

---

## **4. Case: The Poisoned Apple**

**Description**
A poisoned apple is given as a gift. It tastes good. It feels kind. It causes collapse of the recipient’s UEF.

**IER Analysis**

* A UEF exists.
* Catastrophic intrinsic constraint is introduced.
* The UEF collapses.
* An experiential world is destroyed.

This is **experiential moral harm**, unequivocally.

Under IER:

* gift-giving has no intrinsic moral status
* pleasant valence has no moral authority
* surface form and social coding are irrelevant

IER rejects hedonic, symbolic, and intention-only ethics precisely because harm can be **sweet-tasting and deceptive**.

---

## **5. Case: Accidental Harm (Peanut Allergy)**

**Description**
A peanut butter sandwich is given in good faith. The recipient has an unknown, fatal allergy.

**IER Analysis**

* A UEF exists.
* The action triggers catastrophic intrinsic constraint.
* The UEF collapses.

This is **experiential moral harm**.

Crucially:

* experiential moral harm does **not** imply wrongdoing
* experiential moral harm does **not** imply blame
* experiential moral harm does **not** imply responsibility

IER separates these dimensions:

| Dimension      | Status             |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| Harm           | Yes (experiential) |
| Wrongdoing     | Not implied        |
| Blame          | Context-dependent  |
| Responsibility | Graded             |

This allows IER to acknowledge tragedy **without scapegoating**, and to center the destroyed experiential world rather than the innocence of the agent.

## **6. Case: Necessary Local Harm (Broken Arm Rescue)**

**Description**
A person is trapped under wreckage.
To free them, an arm must be forcibly broken.
If this is not done, the person will die.

**IER Analysis**

* A UEF exists.
* The intervention introduces **localized, intense intrinsic constraint**.
* The disruption is **time-bounded and reversible**.
* Without intervention, **irreversible collapse of the same UEF** would occur.

IER does **not** redescribe the broken arm as a benefit, a good, or a justified harm.

Instead:

> The action prevents catastrophic collapse **within the same experiential world**, without converting harm into moral credit.

Key structural points:

* The broken arm is **experiential moral harm**.
* That harm **does not disappear** because collapse was prevented.
* The saved life **does not offset** the harm.
* No aggregation or optimization occurs.

IER allows **harm mitigation without harm cancellation**.

The moral remainder persists.

## **7. Case: Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD)**

**Description**
A UEF undergoes terminal degeneration with no remaining stabilizing trajectory.
Remaining agency initiates intervention that ends the experiential regime.

**IER Analysis**

* Death is always **irreversible experiential moral harm**.
* An experiential world is permanently terminated.
* No experiential benefit is produced.

IER refuses to redescribe death as:

* relief
* neutral outcome
* positive good

What IER explains instead is the structure of the situation:

* intrinsic constraint is already undergoing unavoidable collapse
* no restorative trajectory remains
* continued existence entails increasing fragmentation
* remaining agency **owns** the final resolution

This is **tragic constraint management**, not moral victory.
The harm remains harm.

IER fixes the experiential reality involved without settling legal, political, or dignity-based debates.

---

## **8. Case: Consensual Constraint Play (S&M)**

**Description**
A UEF requests bounded physical force in a consensual context ("I want you to hurt me").

**IER Analysis**

* Pain is not identical to experiential harm.
* Constraint interference is localized, time-bounded, and reversible.
* Agency is exercised, not overridden.
* Global coherence is preserved.

In such cases, **no experiential moral harm need occur at all**.

Consent is not moral alchemy. It matters because:

> The UEF actively recruits external constraint as part of its own regulation.

IER therefore draws a structural distinction:

* **Constraint play** integrated by the UEF is experientially neutral.
* **Constraint imposition** that destabilizes or overrides the UEF is experiential moral harm.

This conclusion concerns experiential harm only; it does not exhaust other moral considerations.

---

## **9. Case: The Transparent Tradeoff**

**Description**
An agent faces a choice:

* Option A: irreversibly destroy one UEF.
* Option B: prevent significant but non-catastrophic experiential harm to many other UEFs.

All consequences are known.
All harms are real.
No uncertainty or coercion is present.

**IER Analysis**

IER does **not** deny that benefits would result under Option B.

IER holds instead:

* destruction of the one UEF is **experiential moral harm**
* that harm is **non-offsettable**
* benefits elsewhere **do not justify or erase it**

IER does not declare the action forbidden or permitted.

What it does is remove the familiar justificatory escape:

> “The numbers make it right.”

If the agent acts, the harm **does not become clean**.
If the agent refuses, the refusal **need not be irrational**.

The framework preserves moral seriousness **without closure**.

---

## **10. Case: The Non-Coercive Refusal**

**Description**
An agent is asked to perform an act that will:

* irreversibly destroy one UEF
* clearly benefit many others
* be legal, expected, and socially praised

The agent refuses.

**IER Analysis**

IER does not declare the refusal correct, required, or virtuous.

IER explains why the refusal is **structurally intelligible**:

* experiential harm is non-offsettable
* standing is non-comparable
* refusal does not require moral error
* guilt does not automatically attach

This shows how IER:

* explains refusal without commanding it
* preserves plural judgment without relativism
* allows action and refusal to coexist without collapse

---

## **11. Case: Dementia Advance Directives**

**Description**
A past UEF authorized death under future conditions.
The present UEF is cognitively altered but experientially content.

**IER Analysis**

IER does not resolve this case—and that is not a failure.

What IER clarifies:

* the same physical system persists
* intrinsic constraint has reorganized
* agency is temporally distributed and discontinuous

IER blocks:

* simple identity talk
* automatic priority of past consent
* aggregation across temporal selves

What remains is a genuine tragic conflict between **historical agency** and **present experiential integrity**.

IER explains *why* the case is hard without pretending it is soluble.

---

## **12. What These Cases Show**

Across all cases, the same structure applies:

* Experiential harm can occur without wrongdoing.
* Consent affects responsibility, not ontology.
* Pain can exist without experiential harm.
* Experiential harm can exist without pain.
* Death is always experiential moral harm.
* Benefit is not a moral primitive.
* Tragedy is not moral failure.

IER’s ethical strength lies not in providing answers, but in **preventing false ones**.

---

## **13. What IER Refuses to Decide**

IER does not:

* rank outcomes
* compute moral totals
* supply decision algorithms
* eliminate tragic remainder
* guarantee clean hands
* determine permissibility

IER tells us **what is at stake experientially**, not how to escape it.

---

## **14. Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* Experiential moral harm is an **organizational fact** about intrinsic constraint.
* Harm, wrongdoing, blame, and responsibility are distinct axes.
* Consent changes ownership, not ontology.
* Pain is experientially neutral; collapse is not.
* Death is always experiential moral harm.
* Aggregation and optimization are structurally forbidden.

> **IER does not make morality comfortable.**
> **It makes it honest.**
