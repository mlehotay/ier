# **IER-Morals: Hard Cases, Harm, and Tragic Permission**

## *Applying Intrinsic Constraint to Moral Edge Cases*

---

## **Status and Scope**

This document is **NON-NORMATIVE**.

It introduces **no new axioms, definitions, criteria, or ethical principles** beyond those fixed exclusively in the
**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.6) Normative Specification**.

All moral authority remains with the Specification.

This document exists to **apply** IER’s ethical commitments to a set of canonical *hard cases*—situations in which everyday moral language breaks down and intuitions conflict. Its purpose is to show how a **single structural account of moral harm** yields clarity without pretending to dissolve tragedy.

If any interpretation here conflicts with the Specification, the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting interpretation is void.

---

## **1. Why a “Morals” Document Is Needed**

IER-ethics establishes what is morally real:

* experiential standing is categorical
* moral harm is organizational
* responsibility is graded
* uncertainty strengthens obligation
* aggregation and optimization are blocked

What it does **not** do is walk through the cases people actually argue about.

Those cases matter because ordinary moral reasoning routinely conflates:

* harm and blame
* pain and damage
* consent and benefit
* intention and permissibility
* outcome and justification

IER enforces sharp separations between these concepts.
Those separations feel counterintuitive until they are **worked through concretely**.

*IER-morals* exists to do exactly that.

## **2. Core Orientation: What IER Asks in Every Case**

IER evaluates moral situations by asking a single organizing question:

> **What happens to intrinsic constraint within a Unified Experiential Field (UEF), and who owns that constraint?**

Everything else—intent, symbolism, social role, narrative framing—matters only insofar as it affects:

* stabilization vs destabilization
* reversibility vs irreversibility
* agency exercised vs agency overridden
* preservation vs collapse of the UEF

This yields conclusions that are often uncomfortable but structurally consistent.

---

## **3. Moral Harm Is Not the Opposite of Moral Benefit**

IER defines **moral harm** as:

> **Destabilization, overload, fragmentation, or irreversible collapse of intrinsic constraint within a UEF.**

IER deliberately introduces **no corresponding primitive of “moral benefit.”**

This is not an omission. It is a consequence of identity.

Intrinsic constraint is not a quantity to be increased or optimized. It is a condition that must be **maintained within a coherent window**. Actions may:

* avoid harm
* mitigate harm
* restore stability
* prevent collapse

But no action produces moral “credit” that cancels or offsets harm.

This blocks:

* utilitarian tradeoffs
* moral arithmetic
* harm justification by appeal to net good

The cases below illustrate how this asymmetry functions.

## **4. Case: The Poisoned Apple**

**Description**
A poisoned apple is given as a gift. It tastes good. It feels kind. It causes collapse of the recipient’s UEF.

**IER Analysis**

* Catastrophic intrinsic constraint is introduced.
* The UEF collapses.
* An experiential world is destroyed.

This is **moral harm**, unequivocally.

Under IER:

* gift-giving has no intrinsic moral status
* pleasant valence has no moral authority
* surface form and social coding are irrelevant

IER rejects hedonic, symbolic, and intention-only ethics precisely because harm can be **sweet-tasting and deceptive**.

## **5. Case: Accidental Harm (Peanut Allergy)**

**Description**
A peanut butter sandwich is given in good faith. The recipient has an unknown, fatal allergy.

**IER Analysis**

* A UEF exists.
* The action triggers catastrophic intrinsic constraint.
* The UEF collapses.

This is **moral harm**.

Crucially:

* moral harm does **not** imply wrongdoing
* moral harm does **not** imply blame
* moral harm does **not** imply responsibility

IER separates these dimensions:

| Dimension      | Status            |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| Harm           | Yes               |
| Wrongdoing     | Not necessarily   |
| Blame          | Context-dependent |
| Responsibility | Graded            |

This allows IER to acknowledge tragedy **without scapegoating**, and to center the harmed experiential world rather than the innocence of the agent.

## **6. Case: Surgery**

**Description**
A surgical procedure causes pain and tissue damage but prevents catastrophic system failure.

**IER Analysis**

* Surgery introduces **localized, reversible disruption**.
* The purpose is to **prevent irreversible collapse**.
* The action occurs within a restorative trajectory.

IER does not justify surgery by claiming that benefit outweighs harm.

Instead:

> Surgery is **harm-mitigating**, not harm-offsetting.

The disruption is permissible because it prevents greater organizational damage **within the same UEF**, not because harm is canceled by benefit.

## **7. Case: Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD)**

**Description**
A UEF authorizes medical intervention to end its own existence under terminal degeneration.

**IER Analysis**

* Death is always **irreversible moral harm**.
* An experiential world is permanently terminated.
* No benefit is produced.

IER refuses to redescribe death as:

* relief
* neutral outcome
* positive good

However, IER allows **tragic permissibility** under extremely narrow conditions:

* intrinsic constraint is already undergoing unavoidable, escalating collapse
* no restorative or stabilizing trajectory remains
* continued existence entails increasing fragmentation
* remaining agency authorizes the act

MAiD is therefore not a benefit, but a decision about **how an already-destroyed trajectory ends**.

IER treats this as tragic constraint management, not moral success.

## **8. Case: Consensual S&M**

**Description**
A UEF requests bounded physical force (“I want you to hurt me”) in a consensual context.

**IER Analysis**

* Pain is not identical to harm.
* Constraint interference is localized, time-bounded, and reversible.
* Agency is exercised, not overridden.
* Global coherence is preserved.

In such cases, **no moral harm need occur at all**.

Here, consent is not moral alchemy. It matters because:

> The UEF actively recruits external constraint as part of its own regulation.

This is categorically different from assault, coercion, punishment, or deception.

IER therefore draws a sharp line:

* **Constraint play** authorized and integrated by the UEF is morally neutral.
* **Constraint imposition** that destabilizes or overrides the UEF is moral harm.

## **9. Case: Dementia Advance Directives**

**Description**
A past UEF authorized death under future conditions.
The current UEF is cognitively altered but content.

**IER Analysis**

IER does not resolve this case cleanly—and that is not a failure.

What IER clarifies is the conflict:

* same physical system
* reorganized intrinsic constraint
* competing loci of agency across time

IER blocks:

* simple identity talk
* automatic priority of past consent
* aggregation across temporal selves

What remains is a genuine tragic conflict between **historical agency** and **present experiential integrity**.

IER explains *why* this is hard without pretending it is soluble.

## **10. Case: One to Save Five (Aggregation)**

**Description**
Killing one UEF would save five others.

**IER Analysis**

IER blocks this move entirely.

Because:

* standing is categorical
* harm is non-scalar
* subjects are non-aggregable

No amount of benefit elsewhere can justify intentional destruction of a UEF.

IER does not optimize worlds.
It constrains actions.

---

## **11. What These Cases Show**

Across all cases, the same structure applies:

* Harm can occur without wrongdoing.
* Consent affects responsibility, not reality.
* Pain can exist without harm.
* Harm can exist without pain.
* Death is always harm, even when permitted.
* Benefit is not a moral primitive.
* Tragedy is not moral failure.

IER’s ethical strength lies not in providing easy answers, but in **preventing false ones**.

---

## **12. What IER Refuses to Decide**

IER does not:

* rank outcomes
* compute moral totals
* supply decision algorithms
* eliminate tragic remainder
* guarantee clean hands

IER tells us **what is at stake**, not how to escape it.

---

## **13. Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* Moral harm is an **organizational fact** about intrinsic constraint.
* Harm, wrongdoing, blame, and responsibility are distinct axes.
* Consent changes ownership, not ontology.
* Pain is morally neutral; collapse is not.
* Death is always moral harm.
* Permissibility is asymmetrical and tragic.
* Aggregation and optimization are structurally forbidden.

> **IER does not make morality comfortable.
> It makes it honest.**
