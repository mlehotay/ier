# **One Puzzle, Many Names: IER’s Unified Response to the Classic Problems of Consciousness**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.6)**
*Derived Explanatory Article — Non-Normative*

---

## **Status and Scope**

This article is **explanatory**.

It:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* adds **no epistemic criteria**
* makes **no independent necessity claims**
* relies exclusively on the identity and constraint framework established elsewhere in the IER book

Its purpose is to catalog the **canonical philosophical puzzles of consciousness** and show how IER provides a **single structural resolution** to all of them.

---

## **1. The Shared Structure of Consciousness Puzzles**

Despite their variety, the classic puzzles of consciousness share a common form:

1. All **physical, functional, or behavioral facts** appear fixed.
2. **Experiential character** still seems variable, missing, or unexplained.
3. The conclusion is drawn that experience must be something *over and above* physical organization.

IER claims this conclusion is driven by a single mistaken assumption:

> **That third-person description of a system can substitute for first-person instantiation of a system.**

IER rejects this assumption by treating experience as the **identity** of certain physical regimes — specifically, **globally integrated regimes of intrinsic informational constraint** — rather than as an additional property.

What follows is a catalog of the major puzzles, using their **standard philosophical names**, and IER’s response to each.

## **2. Mary’s Room (The Knowledge Argument)**

**Canonical formulation**
Mary knows all physical facts about color vision but has never seen color. When she sees red for the first time, she appears to learn something new.

**Standard attribution**
Frank Jackson

**What the puzzle targets**
Whether complete physical knowledge exhausts knowledge of experience.

**IER response**
Mary gains **experiential access**, not new ontological facts.
Knowing everything *about* a regime does not entail *being* that regime.
When Mary’s system instantiates a new globally integrated constraint organization, that organization **is** the experience of red.

No non-physical facts are added; the system enters a new regime.

## **3. Philosophical Zombies**

**Canonical formulation**
A being physically and functionally identical to a human but lacking experience is conceivable.

**Standard attribution**
David Chalmers

**What the puzzle targets**
Whether physical organization necessitates experience.

**IER response**
IER denies the coherence of the zombie description.
If a system instantiates a unified, intrinsically constrained regime, experience is present **by identity**.
A “physically identical but non-experiential” duplicate omits regime identity and is therefore organizationally incoherent.

## **4. The Inverted Spectrum (Inverted Qualia)**

**Canonical formulation**
Two subjects are functionally identical, yet their color experiences are systematically inverted.

**Historical roots**
John Locke

**What the puzzle targets**
Whether phenomenal character outruns functional or physical facts.

**IER response**
Experiential character is fixed by **fine-grained intrinsic constraint relations** within a Unified Experiential Field.
If all such relations are preserved, no inversion remains.
If they differ, functional identity fails.
The scenario cannot satisfy its own constraints.

## **5. Nagel’s Bat (“What Is It Like to Be a Bat?”)**

**Canonical formulation**
We may know everything about bat neurophysiology and still not know what it is like to be a bat.

**Standard attribution**
Thomas Nagel

**What the puzzle targets**
The limits of objective description.

**IER response**
IER accepts the access limit but rejects the metaphysical conclusion.
“What it is like” is not a missing fact — it is the internal perspective of a regime when instantiated.
No amount of third-person description can substitute for participation in that regime.

## **6. The Chinese Room**

**Canonical formulation**
A system manipulates symbols according to rules yet lacks understanding.

**Standard attribution**
John Searle

**What the puzzle targets**
Whether computation alone suffices for understanding or experience.

**IER response**
IER agrees that symbol manipulation alone is insufficient.
Understanding requires **global integration under intrinsic constraint**.
A system executing disjoint rules does not instantiate a unified experiential regime.

## **7. The China Brain / China Mind**

**Canonical formulation**
A nation of individuals implements the functional organization of a brain. Is the nation conscious?

**Standard attribution**
Ned Block

**What the puzzle targets**
Whether functional organization alone guarantees consciousness.

**IER response**
IER denies that large-scale functional coordination without unified intrinsic constraint constitutes a Unified Experiential Field.
Coordination without regime-level integration does not yield experience.

## **8. Fading and Dancing Qualia**

**Canonical formulation**
Gradual neural replacement yields either:

* **Fading qualia**: experience weakens while behavior remains fixed, or
* **Dancing qualia**: experience changes radically without behavioral change.

**Standard attribution**
David Chalmers

**What the puzzle targets**
The relationship between functional organization and experiential continuity.

**IER response**
IER predicts continuity **only if** intrinsic constraint and global integration are preserved.
If regime identity is preserved, experience persists.
If it is not, experience changes or ceases — without paradox.

## **9. The Explanatory Gap**

**Canonical formulation**
Even with complete physical explanations, it remains unclear *why* experiences feel the way they do.

**Standard attribution**
Joseph Levine

**What the puzzle targets**
The apparent insufficiency of physical explanation.

**IER response**
IER treats the gap as a **category error**.
Physical explanation accounts for organization and dynamics.
Experience names what that organization is like when occupied from within.
No further explanation bridges an identity.

---

## **10. The Hard Problem of Consciousness**

**Canonical formulation**
Why does physical processing give rise to experience at all?

**Standard attribution**
David Chalmers

**Relation to the explanatory gap**
The explanatory gap is the *epistemic engine* of the hard problem; the hard problem is its *metaphysical framing*.

**IER response**
IER dissolves the problem by rejecting the premise that experience must be *produced by* physical processes.
On IER, experience **is** certain physical regimes under intrinsic constraint.

---

## **11. The Unifying Diagnosis**

These puzzles are not independent mysteries.

They all rely on the same mistaken move:

> Treating experience as something *added to* physical systems rather than as the **identity of certain physical organizations when instantiated from within**.

Once this assumption is removed, the puzzles collapse together.

---

## **12. The IER Summary Claim**

> The classic puzzles of consciousness do not expose missing ingredients in physics.
> They expose the impossibility of replacing **instantiation** with **description**.

IER resolves them not piecemeal, but structurally.
