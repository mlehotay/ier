# 🔹 COPYPASTA — NEW CONVERSATION

## **Drafting `IER-sleep-welding-capacity.md` (T2)**

---

## Article identity

* **Tier:** T2 — Regime stability and recovery
* **Document type:** Canon-governed, non-normative explanatory article
* **Primary function:** To explain **why sleep is structurally required** as recovery of capacity to bear irreversible resolution

This article introduces:

* **no biological mechanisms**
* **no medical guidance**
* **no optimization principles**

It explains sleep as a **regime-preserving maneuver**.

---

## Central thesis

> **Wakeful experience irreversibly converts admissible futures into sedimented history, consuming intrinsic organizational capacity; sleep restores the ability to continue that conversion without regime collapse.**

---

## Canon constraints

* Do **not** equate capacity with metabolic energy
* Do **not** treat sleep as memory consolidation
* Do **not** imply experience is “turned off” for rest
* Do **not** introduce teleology

---

## Required alignments

Must integrate with:

* `IER-sleep.md`
* `IER-dreaming.md`
* `IER-spoons.md`
* `IER-dynamics.md` — stability windows

---

## Core commitments

* Welding cannot proceed indefinitely
* Capacity depletion narrows futures
* Agency collapses before experience
* Dreams involve low-commitment traversal
* Sleep suspends irreversible fixation

---

## Required language anchor

> **Sleep functions as a regime-level recovery maneuver that attenuates irreversible resolution and restores future-bearing capacity.**

## Outline

1. Status and scope
2. Irreversible resolution as cost
3. Capacity depletion
4. Wakefulness as continuous welding
5. Sleep as suspension of welding
6. Dreaming as low-cost traversal
7. Exhaustion and agency collapse
8. What this article does not claim
9. Intermission

## What success looks like

Readers understand:

* why sleep is mandatory
* why stimulants fake capacity
* why burnout feels like narrowed time

---

## Explicit closure

Sleep is not for optimization.

It is for **survival of the experiential regime**.
