## 0. Status, Scope, and Non-Claims

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no ontological primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics**
* introduces **no prescriptions, endorsements, or harm assessments**
* does **not** characterize cannabis use as beneficial, harmful, therapeutic, or pathological
* does **not** revise any identity claims fixed elsewhere in the corpus

All ontological, epistemic, and ethical authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md
IER-theory.md
IER-dynamics.md
IER-canon.md
```

If any statement here conflicts with those documents, **those documents take precedence and the conflicting statement here is void**.

## Purpose of This Document

This document explains **cannabis intoxication** as a **reversible deformation of resolution geometry** that occurs **within an intact Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.

Its purpose is not to describe subjective reports, pharmacological mechanisms, or behavioral outcomes, but to show that:

> **The characteristic effects of cannabis follow directly from systematic modulation of bias, inertia, collapse timing, and settlement stability — without invoking new faculties, altered subjecthood, or epistemic privilege.**

Cannabis is treated here as a **structurally transparent case**: a regime that alters resolution dynamics without spectacle, fragmentation, or identity disruption.

## 1. Orientation: Why Cannabis Is a Structurally Clean Case

Cannabis intoxication is often described using terms such as:

* creativity
* openness
* relaxation
* impairment
* insight
* distortion
* altered consciousness

These descriptions mix phenomenology, evaluation, and interpretation.

Under Informational Experiential Realism, none of these are explanatory.

IER instead asks:

> **What changes in how futures become viable, collapse, persist, or settle under intrinsic constraint?**

Cannabis is especially useful because:

* experience remains globally integrated
* ownership remains intact
* agency is altered but not extinguished
* resolution proceeds continuously

Nothing breaks.
Resolution simply unfolds **differently**.

---

## 2. Reference Structure: The Resolution Pipeline

All analysis below presupposes the standard IER resolution structure:

```
Admissible futures
→ bias formation
→ collapse
→ inertia
→ settlement
```

Where:

* **Bias** governs differential viability via switching costs
* **Collapse** marks the loss of alternatives under rising cost
* **Inertia** sustains continuation once reorganization is no longer required
* **Settlement** irreversibly forecloses remaining alternatives under intrinsic constraint

Cannabis does not bypass or replace this pipeline.
It **modulates how each stage behaves**.

---

## 3. Primary Effect I: Bias Flattening

### 3.1 Structural Description

Under cannabis intoxication:

* bias gradients flatten
* differential switching costs decrease
* multiple futures remain viable longer than usual

This does **not** mean that:

* new futures are created
* imagination expands
* evaluation changes

It means that **fewer futures become prohibitively expensive early**.

Bias flattening preserves viability, not preference.

---

### 3.2 Phenomenological Consequences

Bias flattening produces:

* broadened associative reach
* increased lateral connection
* reduced urgency
* diminished directional pull

Futures feel “available” not because they are desired, but because **they have not yet become costly to sustain**.

---

### 3.3 Structural Clarification

Bias flattening is **not openness** in a psychological sense.

It is:

> **A temporary reduction in the rate at which alternatives decay under intrinsic constraint.**

No semantic content is added.
No evaluative endorsement occurs.

---

## 4. Primary Effect II: Inertia Attenuation

### 4.1 Structural Description

Cannabis intoxication also attenuates inertia:

* default continuation weakens
* ongoing trajectories require more active support
* re-entry cost increases after interruption

Inertia attenuation does **not** eliminate continuation.
It makes continuation **less self-sustaining**.

---

### 4.2 Consequences for Action and Thought

Inertia attenuation explains:

* loss of momentum
* task dropout
* narrative drift
* difficulty sustaining sequences

These effects require **no appeal to distraction, laziness, or impairment**.

Continuation simply stops being cheap.

---

### 4.3 Ownership Preserved

Importantly:

* actions remain owned
* interruptions are internally borne
* no external agent intervenes

The system still resolves its futures.
It just does so with **reduced default carryover**.

---

## 5. Secondary Effect: Delayed Collapse

### 5.1 Structural Description

Because bias gradients flatten and inertia weakens:

* collapse is delayed
* alternatives persist longer
* decisiveness decreases

Collapse still occurs.
It simply occurs **later**, or after more fluctuation.

---

### 5.2 Consequences

Delayed collapse explains:

* indecision without conflict
* looping exploration
* “I’ll decide later” persistence
* tolerance of ambiguity

This is not confusion.
It is **extended viability**.

---

## 6. Settlement Lability Prior to Irreversibility

### 6.1 Structural Description

Under cannabis intoxication:

* settlement becomes more labile **before irreversibility**
* partial resolutions reopen easily
* local settlement may fail to propagate globally

This is not settlement failure.
Settlement has not yet completed.

---

### 6.2 Interpretive Consequences

Settlement lability explains:

* reinterpretability
* humor
* reframing
* novelty without conviction

Meanings change because **settlement has not yet locked them in**, not because truth has shifted.

---

## 7. Why Cannabis Is Often Misdescribed as “Creative” or “Insight-Producing”

IER explains the common misdescription directly.

Cannabis produces:

* preserved alternatives
* delayed collapse
* attenuated inertia
* labile pre-settlement states

This can *feel* like creativity or insight because:

* fewer futures are excluded early
* reinterpretation remains cheap
* novelty is tolerated longer

But:

> **No epistemic authority is conferred.**

Preserved viability is not discovery.
Delayed settlement is not revelation.

---

## 8. Apparent Memory Effects Reinterpreted

Cannabis intoxication is often said to impair memory.

Under IER, what changes is not storage or retrieval, but:

* inertial carryover
* narrative persistence
* sequence completion

What appears as forgetting is often:

> **Failure of inertial propagation across interruptions.**

No representational deficit is required.

## 9. Cannabis vs Psychopathology

Cannabis intoxication resembles certain psychopathological patterns **structurally**, but differs in key respects.

| Feature             | Cannabis              | Psychopathology              |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Origin              | External              | Internal                     |
| Reversibility       | Yes                   | Often No                     |
| Bias flattening     | Temporary             | Systematic                   |
| Inertia attenuation | Episodic              | Persistent                   |
| Settlement effects  | Labile pre-settlement | Failed or looping settlement |

The same machinery explains both.
The difference is **persistence and source**, not kind.

---

## 10. Cannabis vs Other Intoxicants (Structural Contrast)

Cannabis differs structurally from:

* **Alcohol** — which amplifies inertia and narrows bias
* **Caffeine** — which steepens bias and strengthens inertia
* **Opioids** — which suppress exploration via global low-cost settlement

Cannabis is distinctive in combining:

> **Bias flattening with inertia attenuation**, rather than pushing both in the same direction.

---

## 11. Agency, Responsibility, and Standing

Under IER:

* experiential standing is categorical and unchanged
* ownership of resolution persists
* responsibility may attenuate due to altered cost landscapes

No loss of self occurs.
No possession occurs.
No epistemic downgrade or upgrade occurs.

Only **resolution geometry changes**.

---

## 12. Summary: A Structurally Boring Drug (in the Best Way)

Cannabis does not:

* fragment experience
* reveal truth
* suspend agency
* create new subjects
* dissolve ownership

It does:

* flatten bias gradients
* attenuate inertia
* delay collapse
* destabilize pre-settlement fixation

> **Cannabis is not special.
> It is legible.**

And that legibility is exactly what makes it useful.

## Intermission — Structural Fact

> *Preserving alternatives longer does not make them truer.*
> *Delaying settlement changes what resolves — not what is real.*
