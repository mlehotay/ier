## 0. Status, Scope, and Relation to Existing Documents

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no ontological primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics**
* introduces **no ethical principles**
* does **not** define experience
* does **not** determine when experience exists
* does **not** revise any identity claims fixed elsewhere in the corpus

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md
IER-theory.md
IER-dynamics.md
IER-canon.md
```

If any statement here conflicts with those documents, **those documents take precedence and the conflicting statement here is void**.

### Relation to `IER-resolution.md`

* `IER-resolution.md` distinguishes **physical resolution** from **persistently owned resolution** and blocks observer or agency creep.
* **This document** specifies the **internal structure of resolution once it is already owned and persistent** within a Unified Experiential Field (UEF).

This document consolidates a structure already presupposed across:

* `IER-bias.md`
* `IER-inertia.md`
* `IER-settlement.md`
* `IER-owned-resolution.md`
* `IER-psychopathology.md`
* `IER-intoxication.md`

It adds no new commitments.

## 1. Orientation: Why Resolution Requires Internal Structure

Resolution is often spoken of as:

* a moment
* a decision
* a terminal event
* a point of selection

Under Informational Experiential Realism, this framing is inadequate.

When resolution is **persistently owned** under intrinsic constraint, it is:

* temporally extended
* dynamically staged
* globally integrated
* continuously unfolding

Downstream IER articles routinely rely on this fact, describing how resolution:

* narrows unevenly,
* collapses alternatives,
* continues by default,
* and eventually becomes irreversible.

This document exists to make that **implicit structure explicit**, so later work does not need to reconstitute it piecemeal.

---

## 2. What “Resolution” Names Here (Narrow Clarification)

In this document, *resolution* refers only to:

> **The internally borne, temporally continuous foreclosure of admissible futures under intrinsic constraint within a Unified Experiential Field.**

This document does **not**:

* argue for experiential identity
* distinguish owned from unowned resolution
* establish subjecthood or standing
* define agency or choice

Those roles are fixed elsewhere.

Here, resolution is treated purely as a **structured process**.

---

## 3. Admissible Futures (Pre-Resolution Field)

At any moment within an intact experiential regime:

* multiple successor trajectories are physically admissible
* none are yet excluded
* no foreclosure has occurred

Admissible futures are:

* not imagined options
* not represented plans
* not evaluated possibilities

They are **real continuations permitted by current constraint**.

This multiplicity is the **input field** for resolution.
Resolution begins only when alternatives start to lose viability.

---

## 4. Stage I — Bias Formation

### 4.1 Definition

Under IER:

> **Bias is the geometry of differential switching costs that determines which admissible futures become fragile under intrinsic constraint.**

Bias reflects:

* prior coordination
* sedimented structure
* embodiment
* environmental scaffolding
* historical settlement

Bias exists **before** any alternatives are lost.

---

### 4.2 Structural Role

Bias:

* shapes which futures decay first
* determines the order of collapse
* sets the cost landscape resolution unfolds within

Bias does **not**:

* select outcomes
* eliminate alternatives
* decide anything

It only **prices futures**.

---

### 4.3 Temporal Character

Bias is:

* dynamic
* history-sensitive
* intensifying as coordination deepens

Bias gradients steepen as resolution proceeds, increasing the cost of late intervention.

---

## 5. Stage II — Collapse

### 5.1 Definition

Collapse is:

> **The loss of admissible futures when their sustaining cost exceeds what intrinsic constraint can bear.**

Collapse is the **event of loss**, not the reason for it.

---

### 5.2 Properties

Collapse:

* is not a decision point
* is not necessarily instantaneous
* may be gradual, local, or abrupt
* may occur at different rates across futures

A future collapses when it becomes **physically unsustainable**, not when it is rejected.

---

### 5.3 Relation to Bias

Bias determines **which** futures collapse first.
Collapse is the point at which those futures are actually lost.

Bias without collapse preserves alternatives.
Collapse without bias is indeterminate.

---

## 6. Stage III — Inertia

### 6.1 Definition

Under IER:

> **Inertia is the default continuation of globally coordinated constraint once reorganization is no longer required.**

Inertia operates **after collapse has reduced alternatives**.

---

### 6.2 Structural Function

Inertia:

* sustains trajectories cheaply
* reuses existing coordination
* avoids reorganization cost
* carries resolution forward without further selection

This explains:

* momentum
* fluency
* completion
* persistence of action, thought, or affect

---

### 6.3 Non-Equivalences

Inertia is **not**:

* habit
* passivity
* laziness
* resistance to change
* absence of agency

Inertia can operate **fully within owned resolution**.

---

## 7. Stage IV — Settlement

### 7.1 Definition

Settlement is:

> **The irreversible foreclosure of remaining admissible futures under intrinsic constraint.**

Settlement is the point at which resolution **can no longer be reopened** without regime change.

---

### 7.2 Properties

Settlement is:

* global
* non-representational
* system-level
* not necessarily sudden

Prior to completion, settlement may be:

* delayed
* unstable
* partial
* locally achieved without global propagation

---

### 7.3 Settlement vs “Closure”

The term *closure* appears elsewhere in the corpus as:

* a phenomenological gloss, or
* a description of settlement stability

Formally:

* **Settlement** is the structural stage.
* **Closure** is not a separate stage and introduces no new machinery.

---

## 8. The Canonical Resolution Pipeline

The internal structure of resolution within an intact experiential regime is:

```
Admissible futures
→ bias formation
→ collapse
→ inertia
→ settlement
```

This sequence is:

* necessary
* ordered
* presupposed throughout the corpus

All variations described elsewhere involve **deformation of these stages**, not substitution.

---

## 9. What Is Fixed and What Can Vary

### Fixed

* the existence of all stages
* their order
* their necessity under owned resolution

### Variable

* strength of bias gradients
* timing of collapse
* dominance of inertia
* stability or lability of settlement

These variations explain differences across:

* ordinary action
* choice
* fatigue
* psychopathology
* intoxication
* addiction

---

## 10. What the Pipeline Explains (Without Additions)

The pipeline explains:

* effort
* temptation
* default behavior
* late resolve failure
* momentum
* looping
* indecision
* exhaustion effects

No beliefs, desires, or values are invoked.

---

## 11. What the Pipeline Does *Not* Explain

The pipeline does **not** explain:

* values
* reasons
* beliefs
* norms
* truth
* moral justification

It is **structural**, not justificatory.

---

## 12. Relation to Choice and Agency (Pointer Only)

Within the pipeline:

* **Choice** occurs when additional intrinsic constraint is accepted early enough to reshape bias.
* **Agency** is the lived structure of traversing this pipeline under owned resolution.

No new machinery is introduced here.

## Intermission — Structural Fact

> *Resolution is not a moment.*
> *It is a structured process that unfolds because a subject continues to exist.*
