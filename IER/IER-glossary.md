# **IER Glossary (Core Terms)**

**Tier-4 — Explanatory Reference (v10.8.1)**

---

## **Status and Scope**

This glossary provides **canon-constrained definitions** of the **core terms used throughout the Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** corpus.

It is:

* **Tier-4 only** — explanatory and non-authoritative
* **Purely referential** — no new claims, criteria, or implications
* **Restrictive by design** — intended to block misreadings and imported meanings

All definitions defer **exclusively** to Tier-1 canonical documents.
If any entry here appears to conflict with a Tier-1 document, the Tier-1 document takes precedence and this entry is void.

This glossary explains **how terms are used in IER**, not how they are used elsewhere.
