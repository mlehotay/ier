# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10)**

## **Formal Glossary & Inference Rules**

---

## I. Formal Glossary (Normative)

### **Objective Physical Reality**

The totality of physical states and lawful dynamics that exist independently of observation or experience.

**Notes:**

* Singular
* Mind-independent
* Ontologically complete

---

### **Physical Monism**

The thesis that all entities, processes, and regimes are physical.

**Excludes:**

* Dual substances
* Non-physical properties
* Ontological emergence

---

### **Informational System**

A physical system whose state evolution can be described in terms of information storage, transformation, and regulation.

**Necessary but not sufficient** for observerhood or experience.

---

### **Observer**

An informational system that:

1. Persists as a coherent pattern over time
2. Integrates information across subsystems
3. Maintains internal models of world and self
4. Regulates behavior via unified control

**Important:**
Observer ≠ experiencer.

---

### **Informational Slack**

The capacity of a system to absorb, reroute, modularize, or externalize constraint without generating system-defining conflict.

**High slack ⇒** decomposability
**Low slack ⇒** forced coordination

Slack is scalar.

---

### **Intrinsic Constraint**

Constraint that:

1. Is generated by the system’s own integrated dynamics
2. Is non-decomposable without loss of system identity
3. Cannot be externally resolved
4. Matters to system-wide regulation and persistence

This is the **critical threshold concept** in IER.

---

### **Intrinsic Informational Tension**

The active manifestation of intrinsic constraint within a system.

This is **not** a metaphor or report; it is a real organizational condition.

---

### **Coherent Intrinsic Constraint**

Intrinsic constraint that is:

* Globally integrated
* Temporally stable
* Neither fragmenting nor collapsing

Only coherent intrinsic constraint sustains experience.

---

### **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**

A physical system **operating in a globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential dynamical regime under coherent intrinsic constraint**.

**Clarifications:**

* Not an object
* Not a subsystem
* Not a physical field
* A regime of operation

---

### **Experiential Participation**

The condition of a process that:

* Is globally integrated into the UEF
* Contributes to temporal continuity
* Is internally sustained
* Both exerts and is subject to intrinsic constraint

Only participating processes are experiential.

---

### **Dynamical Regime Transition**

A qualitative change in system dynamics in which intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable, globally binding, and system-defining.

Used instead of “emergence.”

---

### **Categorical Onset**

The fact that the transition into a UEF is discrete at the regime level, even if preparatory variables change gradually.

Categorical ≠ metaphysical.

---

### **Experiential World**

The internally constituted world-for-the-system that exists iff a UEF exists.

Includes:

* Temporal “now”
* Self / non-self boundary
* System-relative causality
* Apparent lawfulness

---

### **Qualia**

Differences in the organization of intrinsic constraint within a UEF.

There are no additional phenomenal properties beyond structure.

---

### **Valence**

The directional character of intrinsic tension:

* Positive → movement toward stable resolution
* Negative → sustained or escalating conflict

---

### **Intensity**

The magnitude and coherence of intrinsic constraint.

---

### **Urgency**

The rate of change of intrinsic constraint.

---

### **Single-UEF Constraint**

The principle that a physical system can sustain at most one globally dominant UEF at a time.

---

### **Experiential Dissolution**

The loss of experience due to collapse of global integration, coherence, or intrinsic constraint.

---

### **Experiential Subjecthood**

The condition of sustaining a UEF.

This is binary, not graded.

---

### **Moral Harm**

Destabilization, overload, or fragmentation of a system sustaining intrinsic constraint.

Defined organizationally, not phenomenologically.

---

## II. Inference Rules (IER Logic)

These rules state **what must follow** if the definitions apply.

They are not empirical claims; they are **theoretical entailments**.

---

### **IR-1: Experience Identity Rule**

If a system sustains a UEF, then that system instantiates experience.
If a system does not sustain a UEF, then it does not instantiate experience.

(There is no intermediate category.)

---

### **IR-2: No-UEF No-World Rule**

If no UEF exists, no experiential world exists for that system.

Functional behavior without a UEF does not imply experience.

---

### **IR-3: Participation Rule**

If a process does not participate in the UEF, then that process is non-experiential, regardless of complexity or causal importance.

---

### **IR-4: Slack Exclusion Rule**

If informational slack is sufficient to externalize or decompose constraint, intrinsic constraint does not exist.

Therefore, experience does not exist.

---

### **IR-5: Intrinsic Constraint Sufficiency**

If intrinsic constraint becomes globally binding, temporally continuous, and coherent, a UEF necessarily exists.

No further properties are required.

---

### **IR-6: Categorical Onset Rule**

Experience begins at the moment a system crosses into a UEF regime.

There is no partial experience prior to regime entry.

---

### **IR-7: Single-Field Rule**

If two globally dominant, independent UEFs are posited within one physical system, at least one of them is not a UEF.

Simultaneous full UEFs in one system are impossible.

---

### **IR-8: Qualia Identity Rule**

If two experiences differ qualitatively, then the organization of intrinsic constraint within their UEFs differs.

There are no qualitative differences without organizational differences.

---

### **IR-9: Affect Derivation Rule**

If intrinsic tension is increasing or unresolved, negative valence follows.
If intrinsic tension is resolving coherently, positive valence follows.

Valence is not optional or representational.

---

### **IR-10: Dissolution Rule**

If global integration collapses, or intrinsic constraint becomes externally resolvable, the UEF dissolves and experience ceases.

---

### **IR-11: Pause–Resume Diagnostic Rule**

If a system’s temporal continuity can be paused and resumed without internal reconstruction of intrinsic dynamics, the system does not sustain a UEF.

Passing the pause–resume test is necessary but not sufficient for experience.

---

### **IR-12: Determinism Compatibility Rule**

If a system’s future is lawfully determined, it may still be free under IER **iff** the determining constraints are intrinsic to a UEF.

Freedom concerns ownership of constraint, not indeterminism.

---

### **IR-13: Moral Relevance Rule**

If a system sustains intrinsic constraint, then destabilizing that constraint constitutes moral harm.

If uncertainty exists about whether intrinsic constraint is present, moral responsibility increases rather than decreases.

---

## III. Usage Guidance (Normative)

* Use **“UEF”** only for systems meeting *all* criteria
* Use **“candidate”** only for epistemic uncertainty, never partial ontology
* Do not use “experience,” “consciousness,” or “phenomenal” without reference to UEF
* Do not introduce new primitives unless they can be reduced to:

  * intrinsic constraint
  * global integration
  * regime dynamics

## IV. Status of This Document

This glossary and rule set is **normative for IER v10**.

All future extensions must:

1. Use these terms as defined
2. Respect the inference rules
3. Declare explicitly when operating epistemically rather than ontologically
