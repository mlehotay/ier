## **Status Declaration (Binding for Interpretation)**

This document is **NOT CANONICAL** and **NOT PART OF THE IER CORPUS**.

Under the rule defined in `IER-manifest.md`:

> **Non-Corpus Material** — Any file not explicitly enumerated in the manifest is **non-corpus**, regardless of repository location or filename.

Accordingly:

* This document introduces **no ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical commitments**
* It carries **no interpretive or adjudicative authority**
* It may **not** be cited to interpret, defend, evaluate, or extend Informational Experiential Realism (IER)
* If any statement here conflicts with a corpus document—especially
  `IER-specification.md`, `IER-theory.md`, `IER-dynamics.md`, or `IER-topology.md`—
  **the corpus document takes precedence and this document is void at the point of conflict**

This document exists **solely for internal author coordination, projection hygiene, and scope control**.

## **1. Purpose of This Document**

IER explains several central domains—time, memory, identity, agency, history, and possibility—as **distinct projections of a single underlying constraint geometry**.

That structural claim is made **canonically and exclusively** in:

```
IER-topology.md
```

This document does **not** restate or justify that claim.

Its sole purpose is to:

* identify **which existing corpus documents function as the six projection anchors**, and
* specify a **uniform explanatory interface** that each projection article must implement.

This prevents:

* silent scope creep,
* cross-projection leakage,
* accidental hierarchy,
* and gradual reintroduction of faculty models.

## **2. The Six Constraint Projections (As Implemented in the Corpus)**

The following table identifies the **actual projection owners**, based strictly on the manifest.

No new documents are implied.

| Projection Domain | Canonical Projection Article |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Time**          | `IER-continuity.md`          |
| **Memory**        | `IER-memory.md`              |
| **Identity**      | `IER-identity.md`            |
| **Agency**        | `IER-agency.md`              |
| **History**       | `IER-sedimentation.md`       |
| **Possibility**   | `IER-futures.md`             |

Supporting or downstream documents may elaborate cases, but **projection authority lives only in these six files**.

## **3. Required Interface: “Explanatory Orientation” Section**

Each of the six projection articles **must contain** a clearly labeled subsection titled:

> **Explanatory Orientation**

This section is mandatory.

It may be brief, but it must **substantively satisfy all six requirements below**.

---

### **I-1. Question Ownership**

Each projection must explicitly state **the single explanatory question it answers**.

Canonical ownership:

* Time → *What is happening now?*
* Memory → *What remains reachable?*
* Identity → *Who is bearing this?*
* Agency → *Is this resolution owned?*
* History → *Why is the system shaped this way?*
* Possibility → *What could still occur?*

A projection **must not** attempt to answer any other hexad question.

---

### **I-2. Foregrounded Aspect of Constraint**

Each projection must state **which aspect of constraint geometry it foregrounds**, e.g.:

* asymmetry / traversal
* reachability
* ownership persistence
* collapse
* sedimentation
* topological openness

This is an **orientation choice**, not a new structure.

---

### **I-3. Fixed Structure**

Each projection must state **what is treated as invariant** throughout the explanation.

Examples:

* system boundary
* existence of admissible futures
* irreversibility of resolution
* current intrinsic constraint state

This blocks illicit inference across projections.

---

### **I-4. Allowed Variation**

Each projection must state **what is allowed to vary** within its account.

Examples:

* participation pathways
* narrowing of choice spaces
* loss of degrees of freedom
* accessibility under current constraint

Variation must remain internal to the projection’s own question.

---

### **I-5. Projection-Specific Non-Claims**

Each projection must include **explicit refusals** tailored to its domain.

Examples:

* Time → no privileged present, no spacetime metaphysics
* Memory → no storage, traces, or retention
* Identity → no psychological or narrative criteria
* Agency → no indeterminism or executive controller
* History → no stored past, replay, or encoded traces
* Possibility → no probability, modal realism, or optimization

These refusals are **structural containment**, not disclaimers.

---

### **I-6. Mandatory Deferral Clause**

Each projection article must include the following sentence verbatim, or in trivially equivalent form:

> **Unification with other constraint projections is handled exclusively in `IER-topology.md`.**

No projection may perform synthesis, reconciliation, or cross-domain explanation.

---

## **4. Global Prohibitions (Across All Projections)**

A projection article must **not**:

* redefine constraint geometry
* privilege its projection as foundational
* infer claims licensed only in another projection
* explain another projection’s question “in passing”
* import psychological, epistemic, or narrative criteria
* introduce metrics, diagnostics, or optimization language

Violations constitute **scope errors**, not stylistic differences.

---

## **5. Relation to `IER-hexad.md`**

This document has **no authority over** and **no visibility within** `IER-hexad.md`.

* `IER-hexad.md` is **reader-facing and navigational**
* `IER-interface.md` is **internal and methodological**

The hexad **names** the six projections.
This interface **disciplines how they are written**.

No reference to this file should appear in any corpus document.

---

## **6. Internal Enforcement Rule**

During drafting, revision, or review of any projection article:

* Failure to implement all six interface requirements is an **internal error**
* Reader intuition or elegance does **not** excuse omission
* Redundancy across projections signals leakage
* Successful isolation is more important than local completeness

This document exists to prevent **gradual theoretical drift**, not to constrain prose.

## **Intermission — Structural Fact**

> **The interface adds nothing to IER.
> It makes explicit what the theory already forces.**
