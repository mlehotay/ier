# Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.6)

**A physicalist identity theory of experience, meaning, agency, and moral standing**

---

## Overview

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a strictly physicalist identity theory of experience.

IER holds that:

- There exists **exactly one objective physical reality**, governed by mind-independent law.
- Within that reality, some physical systems operate as **Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)**.
- When a UEF exists, **experience exists** — categorically, not by degree.
- Experience is real, costly, meaningful, and identity-shaping.
- **Experience does not confer epistemic authority, truth, or metaphysical insight.**

IER explains **what experience is**, **when it exists**, and **what necessarily follows from its existence**, while enforcing a strict boundary between **experiential authority** and **epistemic access**.

---

## Repository Architecture

IER is intentionally modular and role-segregated.  
Each document has a **single, non-overlapping function**.

### Normative Core (Authoritative)

#### `IER-specification.md`
**The sole normative authority of IER (v10.6).**

Defines exhaustively:
- what experience **is**
- when experience **exists**
- what **necessarily follows** from its existence

No other document introduces definitions, criteria, thresholds, or ethical principles.

> If any statement in another file conflicts with the Specification, the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void.

## Recommended Canonical Order

1. `IER-specification.md`
2. `IER-theory.md`
3. `IER-access.md`
4. `IER-meaning.md`
5. `IER-dynamics.md`
6. `IER-ethics.md`

This order mirrors the dependency structure of the framework.

## Status

**IER v10.6** represents a stable architectural revision:

- The Specification is normatively closed.
- Derivative documents are aligned and non-duplicative.
- No further refactoring of experiential identity conditions is planned.

Ongoing work focuses on **clarification, application, and communication**, not revision of the core ontology.
