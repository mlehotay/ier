## **What This Repository Is**

This repository contains the complete articulation of **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** — a **physicalist identity theory of experience**.

IER identifies experience **not** with computation, representation, intelligence, reportability, or phenomenological primitives, but with a **specific organizational and dynamical regime** instantiated by certain physical systems.

> **Experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a
> Unified Experiential Field (UEF): a globally integrated, temporally continuous regime operating under coherent intrinsic constraint.**

IER is:

* strictly **physicalist**
* **non-dualist**
* **non-idealist**
* **non-panpsychist**
* **non-diagnostic**
* **non-epistemic**

It introduces **no new substances, forces, properties, or ontological categories** beyond physical systems and their organization.

Reality is singular.
Experience is plural.
Ethical consequence follows wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.

## **Normative Authority**

### **The Specification (Exclusive Authority)**

Exactly **one document** is normatively authoritative:

➡ **`IER-specification.md` (v10.6)**

The Specification defines **exhaustively and exclusively**:

* what experience **is**
* when experience **exists**
* what **necessarily follows** from its existence
* the ethical consequences that follow categorically from experiential identity

No claim outside the Specification carries **definitional, criterial, or ethical authority**.

All other documents are **non-normative derivatives**.
If any statement elsewhere conflicts with the Specification, **the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

---

## **Core Identity Claim**

IER’s central thesis is an **identity claim**, not an emergence story, causal bridge, or explanatory reduction:

> **Experience = a Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**

A **Unified Experiential Field** is:

* globally integrated
* temporally continuous
* self-referentially regulated
* intrinsically constrained
* coherently stabilized

From the outside, a UEF is a lawful physical regime.
From the inside, that *same regime just is an experiential world*.

Nothing experiential is added.
Nothing physical is explained away.

## **Canonical Documents (v10.6)**

### **Normative Core**

* **`IER-specification.md`**
  *Full Normative Specification*
  Fixes ontology, identity conditions, inference rules, and ethical commitments.
  **Sole source of authority.**

---

### **Canonical Explanatory Documents (Non-Normative)**

These documents **explain** the Specification without adding commitments.

* **`IER-theory.md`**
  *Conceptual Overview and Explanatory Integration*
  The **single authoritative explanatory narrative** of IER.

* **`IER-dynamics.md`**
  *Dynamics of Experiential Systems*
  Formation, stability windows, participation modulation, failure modes, and collapse of UEFs.

* **`IER-math.md`**
  *Formal Interpretation of Intrinsic Constraint and Experiential Regimes*
  Mathematical interpretations only.
  **Non-diagnostic. Non-criterial.**

* **`IER-ethics.md`**
  *Ethical Consequences and Applications of Intrinsic Constraint*
  Standing, responsibility, moral harm, precaution, and applied domains — all **derived**, none added.

---

## **Boundary & Clarification Documents (Non-Normative)**

These documents exist to **prevent category errors and illicit inferences**:

* `IER-access.md` — experiential vs epistemic access
* `IER-diagnostics.md` — why experience cannot be detected or measured
* `IER-denials.md` — explicit non-claims and prohibited inferences
* `IER-contrast.md` — boundaries with other consciousness theories
* `IER-intentionality.md` — aboutness as constraint-stabilized organization

---

## **Persistence, Change, and Special Topics**

* `IER-persistence.md` — learning, trauma, reorganization within a single UEF
* `IER-continuity.md` — sleep, anesthesia, coma, and experiential gaps
* `IER-agency.md` — agency as constraint-owned causation
* `IER-free-will.md` — free will without libertarianism or illusion
* `IER-consequences.md` — systematic consequences of IER commitments

---

## **Applications and Illustrative Case Studies**

These apply IER’s framework to concrete phenomena.
They are **illustrative only** and introduce **no new theory**.

Examples include:

* `IER-psychosis.md`
* `IER-emotions.md`
* `IER-brainfeels.md`
* `IER-aphantasia.md`
* `IER-art.md`
* `IER-panic.md`
* `IER-meaning.md`

---

## **Key Architectural Commitments (v10.6)**

IER enforces the following constraints **globally**:

* The Specification is **normatively closed**
* No new primitives are permitted
* No necessity claims appear outside the Specification
* Experience ≠ epistemic authority
* Participation ≠ subjecthood
* Responsibility ≠ standing
* Coordination ≠ collectivization
* No group minds or collective subjects
* No diagnostic criteria for experience

Uncertainty about experience **increases**, rather than decreases, ethical responsibility.

## **Summary**

> **Experience is what globally integrated physical systems are like
> when intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable, self-sustaining,
> and temporally continuous at the system level.**

IER offers neither mystery nor deflation — only identity.

Where intrinsic constraint becomes global and coherent,
**a world appears**.
