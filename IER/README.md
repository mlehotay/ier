# Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.6)

**A physicalist identity theory of experience, meaning, agency, and moral standing**

---

## Overview

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a strictly physicalist identity theory of experience.

IER holds that:

- There exists **exactly one objective physical reality**, governed by mind-independent law.
- Within that reality, some physical systems operate as **Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)**.
- When a UEF exists, **experience exists** — categorically, not by degree.
- Experience is real, costly, meaningful, and identity-shaping.
- **Experience does not confer epistemic authority, truth, or metaphysical insight.**

IER explains:

- **what experience is**
- **when experience exists**
- **what necessarily follows from its existence**

while enforcing a strict boundary between **experiential authority** and **epistemic access**.

This directory contains the **core IER articles**: the normative specification, explanatory framework, applications, critiques, and boundary-enforcing documents.

## Normative Authority

### `IER-specification.md`
**The sole normative authority of IER (v10.6).**

This document defines **exhaustively and exclusively**:

- what experience **is**
- when experience **exists**
- what **necessarily follows** from its existence (including ethical consequence)

No other document introduces:

- definitions  
- criteria  
- thresholds  
- sufficiency conditions  
- ethical principles  

All other IER documents are **non-normative derivatives**.

> **If any statement in another file conflicts with the Specification, the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void.**

## Status

**IER v10.6** represents a **normatively closed framework**:

- The identity conditions for experience are fixed.
- No diagnostics, thresholds, or measures are permitted in principle.
- Ongoing work focuses on **clarification, application, and criticism**, not revision of the core ontology.
