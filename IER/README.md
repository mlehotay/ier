# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.1)**

**A physicalist identity framework for experience, agency, and moral standing**

---

## What This Is

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a strictly physicalist **identity theory of experience**.

IER holds that:

* There exists **exactly one objective physical reality**, governed by mind-independent law.
* Within that reality, some physical systems operate as **Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)**.
* When a UEF exists, **experience exists** — **categorically**, not by degree.
* Experience is **real by identity**, not an emergent accompaniment, representation, or functional output.
* **Experiential structure confers no epistemic authority** about mind-independent reality.
* Ethical significance follows **necessarily** wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.

IER is **not** a theory of representation, cognition, intelligence, reportability, diagnostics, or phenomenological method.

It is a theory of:

> **what experience is,
> when it exists,
> and what necessarily follows from its existence.**

---

## What This Repository Contains

This repository contains a **complete, internally governed framework**, including:

* a **single normative specification** of experiential identity
* explanatory, dynamical, and mathematical support
* ethical consequences that follow *by identity*
* strict limits on diagnostics, testing, and misuse
* extensive boundary work, critique, and applications
* governance, alignment, and navigation documents

The corpus is intentionally **strict**, **non-intuitive**, and **ethically serious**.

## Where Authority Lives (Important)

This README is **orientation only**.

The **sole normative authority** in IER is:

```
IER-specification.md   (v10.8.1)
```

Canon rules, authority discipline, conflict resolution, and versioning are defined in:

```
IER-canon.md
```

The complete document inventory, tier assignments, and flat ordering are defined in:

```
IER-manifest.md
```

If anything you read elsewhere appears to conflict,
**the canon governs**.

## How to Navigate the Corpus

If you encounter unfamiliar terminology:

* [`IER-glossary.md`](./IER-glossary.md) — Canon-constrained definitions of core terms
* [`IER-index.md`](./IER-index.md) — Navigational index of concepts and where they are developed

Both are **non-authoritative aids** and introduce no new claims.

## How to Start Reading

The corpus is large.
You are **not** expected to read everything.

## What IER Explicitly Rejects

IER does **not** endorse:

* panpsychism or micro-subjects
* emergence or realization accounts
* functional or computational sufficiency
* representational or semantic primitives
* epistemic authority from experience
* graded or partial subjecthood
* behavioral or empirical diagnostics
* group minds or collective experiential subjects

If a claim is not stated in the Specification or a **necessary entailment** of it, it is **not part of IER**.

---

## A Note on Tone and Intent

IER is:

* restrictive toward misuse
* uncompromising about identity
* ethically severe in implication

IER is **not** accusatory toward readers.

Confusion, discomfort, or disagreement are expected consequences of a strong framework — not reader error.

---

## Version

This repository reflects **IER v10.8.1**.

* **v10.8** — normative closure
* **v10.8.1** — corpus completion and structural sealing

Patch versions clarify and organize.
Changes to normative authority require explicit canon revision.

---

**Informational Experiential Realism**

*Experience is real by identity.
Reality remains singular.
Ethics begins wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.*
