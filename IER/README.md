# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.6)**

*A physicalist identity framework for experience, meaning, agency, choice, and moral standing.*

---

## **Overview**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a strictly physicalist identity theory of experience.

IER holds that:

* There exists **exactly one objective physical reality**, governed by mind-independent law.
* Within that reality, some physical systems operate as **Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)**.
* When a UEF exists, **experience exists** — categorically, not by degree.
* Experience is real, costly, meaningful, and identity-shaping.
* **Experience does not confer epistemic authority, truth, or metaphysical insight.**

IER explains **what experience is**, **when it exists**, and **what necessarily follows from its existence**, while enforcing a strict separation between:

* experiential reality
* epistemic access
* ethical consequence

---

## **Architectural Commitments**

IER enforces the following structural constraints across all documents:

1. **Normative Closure**
   Only one document defines experiential existence and ethical consequence.

2. **Identity, Not Emergence**
   Experience is identical to a physical organizational regime, not caused by or emergent from something else.

3. **Categorical Subjecthood**
   Experience exists or does not exist. There are no partial subjects or degrees of experiencerhood.

4. **Experiential ≠ Epistemic Authority**
   Meaning, urgency, coherence, and intensity do not imply truth.

5. **Precaution Under Uncertainty**
   Ethical obligation increases where experiential status is uncertain, not where it is proven.

Any claim that violates these constraints is out of scope for IER.

---

## **Repository Structure**

IER is intentionally modular.
Each document has a **single, non-overlapping role**.

---

## **Normative Core (Authoritative)**

### **`IER-specification.md`**

**The sole normative authority of IER (v10.6).**

Defines exhaustively:

* what experience **is**
* when experience **exists**
* what **necessarily follows** from its existence

No other document introduces definitions, criteria, thresholds, or ethical principles.

> If any statement in another file conflicts with the Specification, the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void.

---

## **Explanatory & Interpretive Documents (Non-Normative)**

All documents below **derive from the Specification** and introduce **no independent authority**.

---

### **Foundations**

* **`IER-overview.md`**
  High-level orientation to the framework.

* **`IER-manifesto.md`**
  Motivational and philosophical positioning.

* **`IER-theory.md`**
  Conceptual integration of intrinsic constraint, unity, participation, and experiential identity.

* **`IER-math.md`**
  Interpretive mathematical structure of intrinsic constraint, choice spaces, and experiential regimes.
  *Mathematics is descriptive, not foundational.*

* **`IER-dynamics.md`**
  Stability, modulation, overload, fragmentation, and collapse of experiential systems.

---

### **Choice, Agency, and Freedom**

* **`IER-choice.md`**
  Choice spaces, narrative paths, and ownership of alternatives.
  Introduces **Choice Spaces** as mid-order informational structures and explains choice as **owned traversal** rather than randomness or metaphysical freedom.

* **`IER-agency.md`**
  Agency as a **derived capacity** to resolve intrinsic constraint through globally integrated dynamics.

* **`IER-free-will.md`**
  Structural dissolution of the traditional free-will debate through choice spaces, ownership, and lawfulness.

---

### **Meaning, Access, and Intentionality**

* **`IER-access.md`**
  Distinction between experiential access and epistemic access.

* **`IER-meaning.md`**
  Meaning, narrative recurrence, and experiential pluralism as organizational phenomena.

* **`IER-intentionality.md`**
  Intentionality as constraint-stabilized orientation, not semantic representation.

---

### **Phenomenology & Lived Experience**

* **`IER-emotions.md`**
  Emotions as stable organizations of intrinsic constraint.

* **`IER-brainfeels.md`**
  Endogenous qualitative patterns and internally generated experiential structure.

* **`IER-aphantasia.md`**
  High-coherence, low-slack experiential architectures.

* **`IER-panic.md`**
  Panic and vasovagal responses as regime-preserving strategies.

* **`IER-psychosis.md`**
  Psychosis as pathological instability within a Unified Experiential Field.

* **`IER-art.md`**
  Art and beauty as constraint-shaping structures.

---

### **Time, Continuity, and Change**

* **`IER-continuity.md`**
  Experiential regime continuity across sleep, anesthesia, and interruption.

* **`IER-persistence.md`**
  Learning, development, trauma, and deep change without subject replacement.

---

### **Ethics and Consequences**

* **`IER-ethics.md`**
  Ethical consequences of experiential identity: standing, harm, responsibility, and precaution.

* **`IER-consequences.md`**
  Systematic implications across ontology, ethics, uncertainty, and science.

---

### **Boundaries, Diagnostics, and Clarification**

* **`IER-denials.md`**
  Explicit non-claims and boundary enforcement.

* **`IER-contrast.md`**
  Incompatibilities with adjacent theories of mind.

* **`IER-diagnostics.md`**
  Why experience cannot be detected or measured in principle.

* **`IER-FAQ.md`**
  Clarifications of common confusions.

* **`IER-puzzles.md`**
  Canonical consciousness puzzles and their structural resolution under IER.

---

## **Recommended Reading Order**

1. `IER-specification.md`
2. `IER-theory.md`
3. `IER-math.md`
4. `IER-choice.md`
5. `IER-agency.md`
6. `IER-free-will.md`
7. `IER-ethics.md`

This order mirrors the dependency structure of the framework.

---

## **Status**

**IER v10.6** represents a stable architectural revision:

* The Specification is normatively closed.
* Choice, agency, and free will are structurally integrated.
* All derivative documents are aligned and non-duplicative.

Ongoing work focuses on **clarification, application, and communication**, not revision of experiential identity conditions.

---

**Informational Experiential Realism**
*Experience is real. Choice is owned. Reality remains singular.*
