# Informational Experiential Realism (IER)

**Current Version:** v10.0  
**Status:** Frozen (conceptually stable)

IER is a realist theory of experience that identifies experience with a
specific organizational and dynamical regime instantiated by physical systems.

> Experience is neither fundamental nor illusory, but identical to a regime of
> globally integrated informational dynamics under intrinsic constraint.

## Canonical Authority

**Only one document is normative:**

→ **IER-specification.md**

If a claim cannot be grounded there, it is **not part of IER**.

All other documents are explanatory, interpretive, or applied.

## Repository Structure

**v10.0 Core**
- `IER-specification.md` — definitions and all normative commitments
- `IER-theory.md` — conceptual explanation of the Specification
- `IER-dynamics.md` — regime behavior and stability
- `IER-ethics.md` — ethical consequences derived from the Specification
- `IER-math.md` — formal interpretations (non-diagnostic)

**Applications / Interpretations**
- `IER-meaning.md` — meaning, narrative, pluralism
- `IER-psychosis.md` — pathological and liminal regimes
- `IER-aphantasia.md` — illustrative case study
- `IER-brainfeels.md` — endogenous qualitative stabilizers

## Version History (High-Level)

- **v10.0** — formal specification, unified ontology, ethics and math derived from core
- **v10.1** — structural consolidation and clarification (no new claims)
- **v10.2** — illustrative applications and case studies

## Status Notes

- The Specification exhausts all normative force.
- Applications do not introduce ontology or obligations.
- Repo history is the authoritative archive of prior versions.
