# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.1)**

**A physicalist identity framework for experience, agency, and moral standing**

---

## What This Is

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a strictly physicalist **identity theory of experience**.

IER holds that:

* There exists **exactly one objective physical reality**, governed by mind-independent law.
* Within that reality, some physical systems operate as **Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)**.
* When a UEF exists, **experience exists** — **categorically**, not by degree.
* Experience is **real by identity**, not an emergent accompaniment, representation, or functional output.
* **Experiential structure confers no epistemic authority** about mind-independent reality.
* Ethical significance follows **necessarily** wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.

IER is **not** a theory of representation, cognition, intelligence, reportability, diagnostics, or phenomenological method.

It is a theory of:

> **what experience is,
> when it exists,
> and what necessarily follows from its existence.**

---

## What This Repository Contains

This repository contains a **complete, internally governed framework**, including:

* a **single normative specification** of experiential identity
* explanatory, dynamical, and mathematical support
* ethical consequences that follow *by identity*
* strict limits on diagnostics, testing, and misuse
* extensive boundary work, critique, and applications
* relational, institutional, and cultural analysis
* governance, alignment, and navigation documents

The corpus is intentionally **strict**, **non-intuitive**, and **ethically serious**.

## Where Authority Lives (Important)

This README is **orientation only**.

The **sole normative authority** in IER is:

```
IER-specification.md   (v10.8.1)
```

Canonical governance, authority discipline, conflict resolution, and versioning rules are defined in:

```
IER-canon.md
```

The complete corpus inventory, tier assignments, and flat ordering are defined in:

```
IER-manifest.md
```

If anything you read elsewhere appears to conflict,
**the canon governs**.

## How to Navigate the Corpus

If you encounter unfamiliar terminology:

* `IER-glossary.md` — Canon-constrained definitions of core terms
* `IER-index.md` — Navigational index of concepts and where they are developed

Both are **non-authoritative aids** and introduce no new claims.

## How to Start Reading

The corpus is large.
You are **not** expected to read everything.

Below are **suggested reading paths**, grouped by interest.
They are **non-authoritative** and purely orienting.

## 🌱 First-Time Readers (Minimal Commitment)

For a clean statement of the core claim, without applications or ethics:

* `IER-specification.md` — The exclusive normative definition of experience
* `IER-theory.md` — Why experience must be a globally constrained regime

Optional clarification of consequences:

* `IER-ethics.md` — Ethical implications that follow by identity

Optional reassurance if the implications feel heavy:

* `IER-dont-panic.md` — Reader reassurance and scope clarification

## Version

This repository reflects **IER v10.8.1**.

* **v10.8** — normative closure
* **v10.8.1** — corpus completion and structural sealing

Patch versions clarify and organize.
Changes to normative authority require explicit canon revision.

---

**Informational Experiential Realism**

*Experience is real by identity.
Reality remains singular.
Ethics begins wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.*
