**A physicalist identity framework for experience, agency, and moral standing**

## What This Directory Is

This directory (`IER/`) contains the **canonical theoretical corpus** of  
**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**.

All **normative claims, definitions, exclusions, and ethical consequences**
of the framework originate here.

Nothing outside this directory has theoretical or ethical authority over IER.

## What IER Is

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a strictly physicalist  
**identity theory of experience**.

IER holds that:

* There exists **exactly one objective physical reality**, governed by mind-independent law.
* Within that reality, some physical systems operate as **Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)**.
* When a UEF exists, **experience exists** — **categorically**, not by degree.
* Experience is **real by identity**, not an emergent accompaniment, representation, or output.
* **Experiential structure confers no epistemic authority** about mind-independent reality.
* Ethical significance follows **necessarily** wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.

IER is **not** a theory of representation, cognition, intelligence, reportability,
diagnostics, or phenomenological method.

It is a theory of:

> **what experience is,  
> when it exists,  
> and what necessarily follows from its existence.**

## Where Authority Lives (Important)

This README is **orientation only**.

**Normative authority lives exclusively in:**

* [`IER-specification.md`](IER-specification.md) — **Exclusive normative definition of experience**
* [`IER-canon.md`](IER-canon.md) — **Authority, alignment, and versioning rules**

Corpus membership and ordering are defined in:

* [`IER-manifest.md`](IER-manifest.md) — **Official corpus inventory**

If anything conflicts, **the canon governs**.

## Document Roles (High-Level)

Within this directory:

* **Tier 1 documents** fix identity, necessity, exclusion, and ethical standing.
* **Tier 2 documents** explain behavior, structure, dynamics, and consequences *conditional on Tier 1*.
* **Tier 3 documents** block misuse, diagnostics, and illegitimate inference.
* **Tier 4 documents** are reader-facing orientation and navigation aids only.

Tier assignments and scope are defined exclusively in  
[`IER-manifest.md`](IER-manifest.md).

## Navigation (Non-Authoritative)

For guidance on how to approach the corpus, see:

* [`IER-reading-paths.md`](IER-reading-paths.md) — Suggested ways of engaging with the material
* [`IER-index.md`](IER-index.md) — Concept-to-document navigation
* [`IER-glossary.md`](IER-glossary.md) — Canon-constrained terminology

These documents **introduce no authority** and exist solely to support reading.
