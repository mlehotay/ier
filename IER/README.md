# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**

**Current Version:** v10.x
**Status:** Conceptually complete; normatively closed

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) is a realist theory of experience that identifies experience with a **specific organizational and dynamical regime** instantiated by physical systems.

> **Experience is neither fundamental nor illusory, but identical to a regime of globally integrated informational dynamics under intrinsic constraint.**

IER is strictly physicalist, non-dualist, and non-idealistic.
It introduces no new substances, forces, or ontological categories beyond those required by physical law and organizational identity.

## **Canonical Authority**

**Exactly one document is normative:**

→ **`IER-specification.md`**

All axioms, definitions, identity conditions, and necessary entailments of IER are fixed there.

If a claim cannot be grounded in the Specification, it is **not part of IER**.

All other documents are explanatory, interpretive, or applied.
They **derive from** the Specification and do not amend it.

## **Repository Structure**

### **Normative Core (v10.x)**

* **`IER-specification.md`**
  Formal definitions, principles, and all normative commitments.
  *Authoritative and closed.*

---

### **Canonical Explanatory Derivations**

These documents explain, unpack, or formalize the Specification without adding primitives or obligations.

* **`IER-theory.md`**
  Conceptual explanation of the Specification, including dual-perspective framing and Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs).

* **`IER-dynamics.md`**
  Regime behavior, stability, breakdown, and transitions under intrinsic constraint.

* **`IER-ethics.md`**
  Ethical consequences derived from experiential identity and intrinsic constraint.

* **`IER-math.md`**
  Formal and mathematical interpretations of UEFs and regime dynamics
  *(non-diagnostic, non-reductive)*.

---

### **Boundary & Clarification Companions (Non-Normative)**

These documents close interpretive gaps and prevent misuse or overextension of the framework.
They introduce **no new claims** and impose **no new structure** on the core.

* **`IER-access.md`**
  *Experiential Access vs Epistemic Access*
  Clarifies why experience can feel authoritative without conferring epistemic privilege.

* **`IER-persistence.md`**
  *Learning, Plasticity, and Change Within UEFs*
  Explains how deep experiential change occurs within a persistent Unified Experiential Field, including dynamic participation modulation.

---

### **Applications / Illustrations**

These documents apply IER’s language to concrete phenomena.
They are illustrative only and do not compete with scientific, clinical, or epistemic accounts.

* **`IER-meaning.md`**
  Experiential pluralism, narrative, and meaningful attractors.

* **`IER-psychosis.md`**
  Pathological and liminal regimes described as UEF instability under intrinsic constraint.

* **`IER-aphantasia.md`**
  Non-imagistic, single-channel experiential architecture (illustrative case).

* **`IER-brainfeels.md`**
  Endogenous qualitative stabilizers and internally generated experiential attractors.

## **Version History (High-Level)**

* **v9.x** — exploratory drafts and partial frameworks
  *(deprecated; preserved in git history)*

* **v10.0** — formal Specification, unified ontology, ethics and math derived from core

* **v10.1** — structural consolidation and clarification (no new claims)

* **v10.2** — applications and illustrative case studies

* **v10.3** — clarification of UEF participation dynamics
  *(explicit distinction between regime transitions and participation modulation; no new primitives)*

## **Recommended Reading Order**

1. **`IER-specification.md`**
2. **`IER-theory.md`**
3. **`IER-dynamics.md`**
4. **`IER-ethics.md`**
5. **Boundary & Clarification Companions**
6. Applications / Illustrations as desired

## **Status Notes**

* The Specification exhausts all normative force.
* Explanatory documents clarify implications; they do not expand the theory.
* Applications describe phenomena; they do not validate content or confer epistemic authority.
* No document outside the Specification introduces ontology, obligations, or identity criteria.
* The git history is the authoritative archive of prior versions.
