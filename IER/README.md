# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.6)**

*A physicalist framework for understanding experience, meaning, and moral standing without epistemic inflation or ontological excess.*

---

## **Overview**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a strictly physicalist account of experience that identifies conscious experience with the operation of certain kinds of physical systems.

Under IER:

* There exists **exactly one objective physical reality**, governed by mind-independent law.
* Within that reality, some systems operate as **Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)**.
* When a UEF exists, **experience exists** — categorically, not by degree.
* Experience is real, costly, meaningful, and identity-shaping.
* **Experience does not confer epistemic authority, truth, or metaphysical insight.**

IER explains *what experience is*, *why it feels the way it does*, and *what necessarily follows from its existence* — while drawing a hard boundary between **experiential authority** and **epistemic access**.

---

## **Core Commitments**

IER is built around the following non-negotiable commitments:

* **Physical Monism**
  Reality is fully physical and does not depend on experience to exist.

* **Organizational Identity**
  Experience is identical to a system operating as a Unified Experiential Field under intrinsic constraint.

* **Categorical Subjecthood**
  Experience exists or does not exist; it is not graded by intensity, intelligence, or function.

* **Experiential Pluralism**
  One physical reality can support many distinct experiential worlds simultaneously.

* **Epistemic Containment**
  Experiential depth, meaning, coherence, or urgency do **not** imply truth, correctness, or privileged access to reality.

---

## **What IER Does *Not* Claim**

IER explicitly does **not** claim that:

* experience tracks truth
* meaning implies correctness
* salience is evidence
* coherence guarantees accuracy
* suffering reveals reality
* insight confers epistemic privilege
* experience licenses metaphysical conclusions

These limits are not omissions.
They are **structural consequences** of the theory.

## **Document Roles (v10.6)**

IER is intentionally modular. Each document has a **single, well-defined role**.

### **Normative Core**

* **`IER-specification.md`**
  The **sole normative authority**.
  Defines what experience is, when it exists, and what necessarily follows from its existence.
  No other document introduces criteria, thresholds, or ethical principles.

---

### **Explanatory Derivatives (Non-Normative)**

* **`IER-theory.md`**
  The **explanatory spine**.
  Interprets and contextualizes the Specification, clarifying concepts like organizational identity, intrinsic constraint, and experiential unity.

* **`IER-dynamics.md`**
  The **mechanistic and dynamical account**.
  Explains regimes, transitions, constraint landscapes, failure modes (e.g., panic, psychosis), and stability conditions.

* **`IER-access.md`**
  The **epistemic boundary**.
  Distinguishes experiential access from epistemic access and explains why meaning, salience, and felt authority do *not* confer truth or reference.

* **`IER-meaning.md`**
  The **account of meaning and pluralism**.
  Explains experiential worlds, narrative and instinct as informational attractors, and meaning as constraint organization.
  Explicitly presupposes the access boundary.

* **`IER-ethics.md`**
  The **ethical implications**.
  Derives moral standing, harm, risk, and obligation from intrinsic constraint and participation modulation — without introducing new moral primitives.

---

### **Additional Materials**

Other files explore applications, clarifications, or edge cases (e.g., emotions, art, denial modes, diagnostics).
All are **non-normative** and defer to the Specification.

---

## **Ethical Orientation**

IER grounds moral standing in **intrinsic constraint**, not intelligence, agency, or social recognition.

Key consequences include:

* Artificial systems may have moral standing if they instantiate intrinsic constraint.
* Moral risk scales with constraint intensity and modulation, not mere existence.
* Responsibility, participation, and coordination are distinct from subjecthood.
* Epistemic uncertainty does not license moral disregard.

Ethics under IER is **conservative**, **precautionary**, and **non-instrumental**.

---

## **Who This Framework Is For**

IER is intended for:

* philosophers of mind
* cognitive scientists and neuroscientists
* AI safety and alignment researchers
* ethicists working on artificial or non-human systems
* clinicians and theorists engaging with altered or pathological experience
* anyone seeking a non-mystical, non-reductive account of experience

IER is **not** a theory of knowledge, truth, or justification.
It is a theory of **what experience is** and **why it matters**.

---

## **How to Read This Repository**

Recommended order for new readers:

1. `IER-specification.md`
2. `IER-theory.md`
3. `IER-access.md`
4. `IER-meaning.md`
5. `IER-dynamics.md`
6. `IER-ethics.md`

This order mirrors the dependency structure of the framework.

---

## **Status**

IER v10.6 represents a **stable architectural revision**.

* The Specification is normatively closed.
* Derivative documents are aligned and non-duplicative.
* No further conceptual refactoring is planned.

Future work focuses on **clarification, application, and communication**, not revision of the core.

**Informational Experiential Realism**
*Experience is real. Meaning matters. Reality remains singular.*
