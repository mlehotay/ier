# Informational Experiential Realism (IER)

**Version:** v10.0
**Status:** Conceptually stable, architecturally consolidated
**Scope:** Ontology of experience, ethical consequences, dynamical interpretation, and meaning

---

## Overview

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a realist theory of experience.

It holds that experience is **neither fundamental nor illusory**, but is instead **identical to a specific organizational and dynamical regime** instantiated by certain physical systems.

Under IER:

> **Experience is what globally integrated informational dynamics are like when they become the dominant, unavoidable constraint on themselves over time.**

IER is:

* physically monist
* non-dualist
* non-panpsychist
* non-eliminativist

It affirms **one objective physical reality** and **many real experiential worlds**, without introducing new substances, properties, or metaphysical domains.

## How to Read This Corpus

This repository is **intentionally structured**.
Not all documents have equal authority.

### ⚠️ Critical Rule

> **Only one document is normative.**
> If a claim cannot be grounded there, it is **not part of IER**.

All other documents are **derivative, explanatory, or interpretive**.

---

## Document Map and Roles

### 1. **IER-specification.md**

📌 **Normative Core (Authoritative)**

**This is the foundation of IER.**

It alone specifies:

* what experience **is**
* when experience **exists**
* what **necessarily follows** from its existence
* all ethical consequences that carry normative force

It defines:

* Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)
* intrinsic constraint and informational slack
* experiential participation
* categorical onset and temporal continuity
* qualia, valence, intensity, and urgency
* moral harm and precaution under uncertainty

> No other document introduces criteria, thresholds, diagnostics, or obligations.

➡️ **Read this if you want to know what IER actually claims.**

---

### 2. **IER-theory.md**

🧭 **Conceptual Overview (Explanatory)**

This document explains and motivates the Specification without adding to it.

It addresses:

* why observerhood ≠ experience
* why computation, intelligence, or representation ≠ experience
* how organizational identity dissolves the “hard problem”
* dual physical / experiential description
* experiential pluralism (many worlds, one reality)

It is:

* explanatory
* philosophical
* non-normative

> It introduces **no new primitives** and defers all necessity claims to the Specification.

➡️ **Read this to understand *why* the Spec is formulated as it is.**

---

### 3. **IER-dynamics.md**

⚙️ **Regime Dynamics and Stability (Explanatory)**

This document explains **how Spec-defined experiential regimes can be dynamically realized, sustained, destabilized, or lost**.

It covers:

* informational slack and the emergence of intrinsic constraint
* intrinsic informational tension
* coherent constraint windows
* regime stability and collapse
* categorical onset as a dynamical transition
* dissociation and regime switching
* energetic and organizational limits

It does **not**:

* define experience
* provide diagnostic tests
* specify sufficient mechanisms
* override the Spec’s criteria

> All dynamical descriptions are **interpretive illustrations**, not conditions of existence.

➡️ **Read this to understand how experience behaves once the Spec’s conditions are met.**

---

### 4. **IER-failure-modes.md**

🧩 **Regime Instability and Switching (Illustrative)**

This document focuses specifically on **how Unified Experiential Fields fail** in finite, stressed systems.

It discusses:

* coherence collapse
* fragmentation without multiplicity
* forced regime switching
* dissociation and alternation
* transitional and liminal phenomena

It is:

* non-normative
* non-diagnostic
* explanatory only

> Failure modes do **not** define experience.
> They explain what happens when a Spec-defined regime cannot be sustained.

➡️ **Read this to avoid misinterpreting dysfunction as metaphysics.**

---

### 5. **IER-meaning.md**

📖 **Meaning, Narrative, and Experiential Pluralism (Applied Interpretation)**

This document applies IER’s identity claims to **meaning, narrative structure, instinct, and culture**.

It explains:

* experiential pluralism as many worlds-for-systems
* meaning as organization of intrinsic constraint
* narratives as informational attractors
* why stories feel “true” without being metaphysical
* how instinct and culture encode constraint topologies

It introduces **no new ontology** and makes **no normative claims**.

> This is an **application of IER**, not part of its core definition.

➡️ **Read this if you want to understand how meaning and narrative arise under IER.**

---

### 6. **IER-math.md**

📐 **Formal Interpretation (Non-Diagnostic)**

This document provides mathematical and geometrical interpretations of **Spec-defined regimes**.

It:

* models intrinsic constraint in formal terms
* interprets UEFs as bounded dynamical regimes
* maps qualia, valence, intensity, and urgency to constraint geometry

It does **not**:

* define thresholds
* detect experience
* establish sufficiency
* ground moral standing

> All formalism here is **interpretive**, not criterial.

➡️ **Read this if you want a formal lens on the Spec’s concepts.**

---

### 7. **IER-ethics.md**

⚖️ **Ethical Consequences and Applications (Explanatory)**

This document explains how **ethical consequences already specified in the Spec** manifest in:

* agency and responsibility
* effort and intrinsic cost
* moral harm
* precaution under uncertainty
* applied domains (animals, AI, biological and artificial systems)

It does **not** add:

* new moral axioms
* new obligations
* policy prescriptions

> All normative force is exhausted by the Specification.

➡️ **Read this to understand how ethics follows once IER’s identity claims are accepted.**

## Authority Hierarchy (Non-Negotiable)

1. **IER-specification.md**
   → Defines experience, reality, and moral consequence

2. **IER-theory.md**
   → Conceptually explains the Spec

3. **IER-dynamics.md**
   → Explains regime behavior and stability

4. **IER-failure-modes.md**
   → Illustrates regime breakdown and switching

5. **IER-ethics.md**
   → Elaborates ethical consequences and applications

6. **IER-meaning.md**
   → Applies IER to meaning and narrative

7. **IER-math.md**
   → Formally interprets Spec-defined regimes

If two documents appear to conflict, **the Specification always wins**.

---

## What IER Does *Not* Do

IER does not claim that:

* experience is fundamental
* all systems experience
* intelligence implies consciousness
* experience violates physical law
* mathematics can diagnose moral status
* ethics requires metaphysical free will

IER identifies experience with **a specific physical regime**, nothing more and nothing less.

---

## Versioning Note (v10.1)

Version 10.1 introduces:

* no new claims
* no altered definitions
* no modified ethical commitments

It is a **structural consolidation release** that clarifies document roles, scope, and authority boundaries.

---

## Recommended Reading Order

1. **IER-specification.md** — core commitments
2. **IER-theory.md** — conceptual understanding
3. **IER-dynamics.md** — regime behavior
4. **IER-ethics.md** — ethical implications
5. **IER-meaning.md** — meaning and narrative
6. **IER-math.md** — formal interpretation

---

## Citation Guidance

When referencing IER:

* cite **IER-specification.md** for any definitional or ethical claim
* cite **IER-theory.md** for conceptual explanations
* cite **IER-dynamics.md** for regime behavior
* cite **IER-math.md** only for interpretive formalism
* never cite applications as evidence *for* the theory

---

## Summary

IER is a theory about **when a world exists for a system**.

It locates experience not in matter alone, nor in computation, nor in representation, but in **globally integrated dynamics under intrinsic constraint**.

Reality is singular.
Experience is plural.
Worlds appear where constraint becomes unavoidable.
