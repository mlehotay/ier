# Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.3)

**A physicalist identity framework for experience, agency, and moral standing**

---

## What This Is

This directory (`IER/`) contains the **canonical theoretical corpus** of
Informational Experiential Realism. All normative claims, definitions, and commitments originate here.

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a strictly physicalist **identity theory of experience**.

IER holds that:

* There exists **exactly one objective physical reality**, governed by mind-independent law.
* Within that reality, some physical systems operate as **Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)**.
* When a UEF exists, **experience exists** — **categorically**, not by degree.
* Experience is **real by identity**, not an emergent accompaniment, representation, or functional output.
* **Experiential structure confers no epistemic authority** about mind-independent reality.
* Ethical significance follows **necessarily** wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.

IER is **not** a theory of representation, cognition, intelligence, reportability, diagnostics, or phenomenological method.

It is a theory of:

> **what experience is,  
> when it exists,  
> and what necessarily follows from its existence.**

## Where Authority Lives (Important)

This README is **orientation only**.

**Normative authority lives exclusively in:**

* [`IER-specification.md`](IER-specification.md) — *Exclusive normative definition of experience*

Canonical governance and authority discipline:

* [`IER-canon.md`](IER-canon.md) — *Authority, alignment, and versioning rules*

Corpus inventory and ordering:

* [`IER-manifest.md`](IER-manifest.md) — *Official corpus list and tiers*

If anything conflicts, **the canon governs**.

---

## Navigation Aids

* [`IER-glossary.md`](IER-glossary.md) — Canon-constrained definitions  
* [`IER-index.md`](IER-index.md) — Concept-to-document navigation  

Both are **non-authoritative aids**.

---

## How to Read This

IER is **not meant to be read linearly** and **not meant to be read in full** by most readers.

There is:

* no “complete” reader
* no privileged reading order
* no expectation that you absorb the entire corpus

Start with a **Level-1 path**.  
Then, if you wish, follow **one** primary specialization.  
Everything in Level-3 is optional, modular, and interest-driven.

# Reading Paths (v10.8.3)

The paths below are **tiered by intent**, not importance.  
Files may appear in more than one path where that improves orientation.
