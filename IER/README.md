## **What This Repository Is**

This repository contains the complete formal articulation of **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** — a **physicalist identity theory of experience**.

IER identifies experience **not** with computation, representation, intelligence, or phenomenological primitives, but with a **specific organizational and dynamical regime** instantiated by certain physical systems.

> **Experience is identical to globally integrated, temporally continuous informational dynamics operating under coherent intrinsic constraint.**

IER is:

* strictly **physicalist**
* **non-dualist**
* **non-idealist**
* **non-panpsychist**
* **non-diagnostic**

It introduces **no new substances, forces, properties, or ontological categories** beyond physical systems and their organization.

Reality is singular.
Experience is plural.
Experiential worlds exist *iff* specific organizational conditions obtain.

---

## **The Core Identity Claim**

IER’s central thesis is an **identity claim**, not an emergence story, causal bridge, or explanatory reduction:

> **Experience = a Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**

A **Unified Experiential Field** is a physical system operating in a:

* globally integrated
* temporally continuous
* self-referential
* intrinsically constrained
* coherently stabilized

**dynamical regime**.

From the outside, a UEF is a lawful physical process.
From the inside, that *same process just is an experiential world*.

Nothing experiential is added.
Nothing physical is explained away.

## **Normative Authority**

### **The Specification (Authoritative)**

Exactly **one document** is normatively authoritative:

→ **`IER-specification.md` (v10.5)**

The Specification fixes **exhaustively and exclusively**:

* ontology and axioms
* identity conditions for experience
* necessary entailments
* ethical consequences that must follow

If a claim cannot be expressed using the primitives of the Specification, **it is not part of IER**.

---

### **Specification Derivatives (Non-Independent)**

These documents **do not add, revise, or reinterpret** the theory.
They exist only for compression, proof, and publication guidance.

* **`IER-spec-minimal.md`**
  A minimal identity-only formulation used to anchor the core preprint.

* **`IER-spec-norms.md`**
  A formal demonstration that the Minimal and Full Specifications are **definitionally equivalent** in normative content.

Neither document has independent authority.

---

## **Canonical Explanatory Documents (Non-Normative)**

These unpack the Specification without introducing new commitments.

* **`IER-theory.md`**
  Conceptual explanation of the identity claim, UEFs, and experiential pluralism.

* **`IER-dynamics.md`**
  Regime formation, stability windows, dissociation, collapse, and transitions under intrinsic constraint.

* **`IER-math.md`**
  Formal–interpretive tools (constraint, curvature, regimes).
  *Non-diagnostic. Non-reductive.*

* **`IER-ethics.md`**
  Agency, free will, moral harm, responsibility, and precaution as **necessary entailments** of experiential identity.

---

## **Boundary & Clarification Documents (Non-Normative)**

These exist to prevent category errors and illicit theoretical import.

* **`IER-intentionality.md`**
  Aboutness as constraint-stabilized organization, not primitive semantics.

* **`IER-access.md`**
  Distinction between **experiential access** and **epistemic access**.

* **`IER-diagnostics.md`**
  Why experience cannot be detected, measured, or certified — and why this increases ethical constraint.

* **`IER-denials.md`**
  Explicit non-claims and prohibited inferences.

* **`IER-contrast.md`**
  Boundary contrasts with functionalism, IIT, panpsychism, GWT, phenomenology, and related frameworks.

---

## **Persistence, History, and Consequences**

* **`IER-persistence.md`**
  Learning, trauma, and reorganization *within* a single persistent UEF.

* **`IER-continuity.md`**
  Regime interruption vs death; sleep, anesthesia, coma, and experiential gaps.

* **`IER-evolution.md`**
  Historical development from early informational models to a closed identity theory.

* **`IER-consequences.md`**
  Systematic mapping of ontological, ethical, scientific, and meta-theoretical consequences that **necessarily follow** from IER.

---

## **Applications / Illustrative Case Studies**

These apply IER’s organizational vocabulary to concrete phenomena.
They are **illustrative only** and do not compete with scientific or clinical accounts.

* **`IER-meaning.md` / `IER-meaning-2.md`**
  Meaning and narrative as stable informational attractors under intrinsic constraint.

* **`IER-psychosis.md`**
  Psychosis as pathological regime instability and forced switching.

* **`IER-aphantasia.md`**
  A high-coherence, low-slack experiential architecture lacking voluntary imagery.

* **`IER-brainfeels.md`**
  Internally generated qualitative patterns as **endogenous qualitative stabilizers**.

## **Version History (High-Level)**

* **v9.x** — exploratory and functional drafts *(deprecated; preserved in git history)*
* **v10.0** — formal Specification, unified ontology, ethics derived from identity
* **v10.1–10.4** — consolidation, participation, persistence, and agency refinements
* **v10.5** — intentionality clarification, specification equivalence proof, consequence mapping

---

## **Status Notes**

* The Specification exhausts all normative force.
* No document outside it introduces ontology, identity criteria, or obligations.
* Diagnostic uncertainty **restricts** permissible action.
* Ethics is an **entailment**, not an overlay.

---

## **Summary**

> **Experience is what globally integrated informational dynamics are like when intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable, self-sustaining, and temporally continuous.**

IER offers neither mystery nor deflation — only identity.

Where intrinsic constraint becomes global and coherent,
**a world appears**.
