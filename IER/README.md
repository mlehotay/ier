# Informational Experiential Realism (IER)
**Canonical Theory Corpus — v10.9.x**

---

## What This Directory Is

This directory (`IER/`) contains the **canonical corpus** of  
**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**.

All **ontological identity claims**, **necessary conditions**, **exclusions**,  
and **ethical consequences** of the framework originate **exclusively here**.

Nothing outside this directory has theoretical or ethical authority over IER.

---

## What IER Is (Minimal)

IER is a strictly physicalist **identity theory of experience**.

In brief:

* Some physical systems operate as **Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)**.
* When a UEF exists, **experience exists** — categorically, not by degree.
* Experience is **identical** to the operation of such a regime.
* Experiential structure confers **no epistemic authority**.
* Ethical significance follows **necessarily** where intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.

IER is **not** a theory of representation, intelligence, diagnostics, or detection.

## Where Authority Lives

This README is **orientation only**.

Binding authority lives exclusively in:

* [`IER-specification.md`](IER-specification.md) — normative identity and ethical grounding
* [`IER-canon.md`](IER-canon.md) — authority, alignment, and versioning discipline
* [`IER-manifest.md`](IER-manifest.md) — corpus membership, ordering, and tiers

If documents conflict, **the canon governs**.

---

## Document Roles

Corpus documents are organized by role:

* **Tier 1** — Foundations (identity, necessity, ethics)
* **Tier 2** — Elaboration and consequences (conditional on Tier 1)
* **Tier 3** — Misuse and diagnostic blocking
* **Tier 4** — Reader-facing orientation (non-authoritative)

Tier assignments are defined exclusively in  
[`IER-manifest.md`](IER-manifest.md).

## How to Navigate

For non-authoritative guidance:

* [`IER-reading-paths.md`](IER-reading-paths.md)
* [`IER-index.md`](IER-index.md)
* [`IER-glossary.md`](IER-glossary.md)

These aid reading only and introduce no authority.

---

## Version Status

IER is **normatively closed** as of **v10.8**.

Later versions (including v10.9.x) introduce:

* no new primitives
* no new ethics
* no diagnostics
* no changes to subjecthood conditions

They exist solely to **clarify structure and reduce ambiguity**.

---

## Scope Reminder

This directory defines **what experience is and what follows if it exists**.

It does not attempt to:

* certify experience
* measure consciousness
* optimize moral outcomes
* provide engineering guidance

Those exclusions are intentional and enforced by  
[`IER-canon.md`](IER-canon.md).
