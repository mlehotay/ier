# Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.7)

**A physicalist identity framework for experience, agency, and moral standing**

---

## Overview

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a strictly physicalist **identity theory of experience**.

IER holds that:

* There exists **exactly one objective physical reality**, governed by mind-independent law.
* Within that reality, some physical systems operate as **Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)**.
* When a UEF exists, **experience exists** — **categorically**, not by degree.
* Experience is **real by identity**, not an emergent accompaniment or functional output.
* **Experience confers no epistemic authority** about mind-independent reality.
* Ethical significance follows **necessarily** wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.

IER is not a theory of representation, cognition, intelligence, reportability, or measurement.
It is a theory of **what experience is**, **when it exists**, and **what necessarily follows from its existence**.

## v10.7 Highlights (What Changed)

Version **10.7** is a **tightening release**, not a conceptual overhaul.

Key improvements:

* **Information is explicitly non-primitive**
  Informational language is now defined as shorthand for *physically instantiated state distinctions that modulate future dynamics under intrinsic constraint*.

* **System boundaries are normatively defined**
  UEF attribution is regime-relative, not anatomical, functional, or observer-dependent.

* **Categorical subjecthood is fully protected**
  Continuous parameters are explicitly distinguished from categorical regime membership.

* **Epistemic non-authority is normatively fixed**
  Experiential description provides no privileged access to truth.

* **Observer language is removed from the normative core**

v10.7 closes the remaining specification-level ambiguities without adding new primitives.

## Architectural Principle: Normative Closure

IER enforces a **strict separation of roles** across documents.

### The Core Rule

> **Only one document defines what experience is, when it exists, and what necessarily follows from it.**

That document is the **IER Specification**.

All other files are **non-normative derivatives**:

* they explain,
* apply,
* illustrate,
* or stress-test
  but they **cannot add criteria, thresholds, diagnostics, or ethical authority**.

If any document conflicts with the Specification, **the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

## Canon Structure

### 🔴 Normative Core (Authoritative)

#### `IER-specification.md` (v10.7)

The **sole normative authority** of IER.

Defines exhaustively:

* experiential identity
* Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)
* categorical subjecthood
* intrinsic constraint
* ethical consequence
* precaution under uncertainty

No other file may redefine these.

---

### 🔵 Core Canon (Explanatory & Boundary)

These are **architecturally essential**.
Removing any of them would materially weaken IER.

* `IER-overview.md` — high-level orientation
* `IER-manifesto.md` — philosophical positioning
* `IER-theory.md` — conceptual backbone
* `IER-dynamics.md` — stability, modulation, failure modes
* `IER-math.md` — interpretive formal structure (non-foundational)
* `IER-ethics.md` — ethical consequences of experiential identity
* `IER-diagnostics.md` — why experience cannot be detected in principle
* `IER-access.md` — experiential ≠ epistemic access
* `IER-denials.md` — explicit non-claims and boundary enforcement
* `IER-contrast.md` — incompatibilities with adjacent theories
* `IER-critics.md` — serious objections and remaining pressure points
* `IER-puzzles.md` — resolution of canonical consciousness puzzles

---

### 🟢 Derived Canon (Agency, Time, Responsibility)

These are **downstream but important**.

* `IER-agency.md` — agency as owned resolution under constraint
* `IER-choice.md` — choice spaces and owned traversal
* `IER-continuity.md` — sleep, anesthesia, interruption
* `IER-persistence.md` — learning, trauma, development without subject replacement

---

### 🟡 Valid Applications / Illustrations

These **apply** IER without extending it.

* `IER-meaning.md` — meaning as constraint-stabilizing organization (non-epistemic)
* `IER-intentionality.md` — intentionality without semantics
* `IER-emotions.md` — emotions as constraint attractors
* `IER-psychosis.md` — pathological instability under constraint
* `IER-panic.md` — regime-preserving strategies
* `IER-aphantasia.md` — alternative experiential architectures
* `IER-brainfeels.md` — endogenous qualitative stabilizers
* `IER-art.md` — art and beauty as constraint-shaping structures
* `IER-free-will.md` — dissolution of the free-will debate
* `IER-morals.md` — worked ethical cases
* `IER-consequences.md` — broad implications

These are **legitimate but non-authoritative**.

---

## The IER Paper

#### `IER-paper.md` (v10.7)

A **standalone academic paper** presenting the core identity thesis:

* closed
* non-bridgeable
* non-diagnostic
* non-emergent

The paper defends the **coherence** of the identity claim itself, without importing ethics, agency, or applications.

---

## What IER Explicitly Rejects

IER does **not** endorse:

* panpsychism, micro-subjects, or transient fluctuation-based “experiencers”
* emergence or realization accounts
* functional sufficiency
* representational or semantic primitives
* epistemic authority from experience
* graded or partial subjecthood
* behavioral or empirical diagnostics
* group minds or collective subjects

If a claim is not explicitly stated in the Specification or a necessary entailment of it, **it is not part of IER**.

## Status

**IER v10.7** represents a **mature, normatively closed framework**.

* The identity claim is fixed.
* The specification is stable.
* Remaining work focuses on **application, clarification, and responsible extension**, not revision of the core ontology.

Future additions must respect:

* normative closure
* non-diagnosability
* categorical subjecthood
* epistemic non-authority

---

**Informational Experiential Realism**
*Experience is real.
Meaning matters.
Reality remains singular.*
