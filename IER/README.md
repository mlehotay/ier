# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8)**

**A physicalist identity framework for experience, agency, and moral standing**

---

## Overview

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a strictly physicalist **identity theory of experience**.

IER holds that:

* There exists **exactly one objective physical reality**, governed by mind-independent law.
* Within that reality, some physical systems operate as **Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)**.
* When a UEF exists, **experience exists** — **categorically**, not by degree.
* Experience is **real by identity**, not an emergent accompaniment, representation, or functional output.
* **Experience confers no epistemic authority** about mind-independent reality.
* Ethical significance follows **necessarily** wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.

IER is **not** a theory of representation, cognition, intelligence, reportability, measurement, or phenomenological method.

It is a theory of:

> **what experience is,
> when it exists,
> and what necessarily follows from its existence.**

## Version 10.8 — What This Release Does

**v10.8 is a hardening and consolidation release.**

No new primitives are introduced.
No ontological commitments are changed.

Instead, v10.8:

* converts several **asserted necessities into explicit impossibility arguments**
* sharpens the role of **intrinsic constraint** without mechanizing it
* adds a **principled scope limiter** to precautionary ethics
* reduces surface area by **removing redundant or rhetorical documents**
* enforces a **lean canon** with clearly marked optional material

IER v10.8 is designed to feel **unavoidable rather than stipulated**.

---

## Architectural Principle: Normative Closure

IER enforces a strict separation of roles across documents.

### The Core Rule

> **Only one document defines what experience is, when it exists, and what necessarily follows from it.**

That document is the **IER Specification**.

All other files are **non-normative derivatives**. They may:

* explain
* clarify
* formalize
* apply
* stress-test

But they **cannot**:

* add criteria
* introduce thresholds
* license diagnostics
* define sufficiency conditions
* override the Specification

If any document conflicts with the Specification,
**the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void.**

---

## Canon Structure (Lean v10.8)

### 🔴 Tier 0 — Normative Core (Authoritative)

#### **`IER-specification.md` (v10.8)**

The **sole normative authority** of IER.

Defines exhaustively:

* experiential identity
* Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)
* intrinsic constraint
* categorical subjecthood
* experiential participation
* moral harm
* agency (experiential sense)
* precaution under uncertainty

v10.8 clarifications include:

* an explicit contradiction argument for **single-UEF dominance**
* an explicit **scope limiter** on precautionary asymmetry
* full enforcement of non-primitive informational language

If this file were removed, **IER would not exist**.

---

### 🔵 Tier 1 — Core Derivational Backbone (Essential, Non-Normative)

These documents are required to make the identity claim **intelligible and defensible**.

Removing any one of them materially weakens the framework.

* **`IER-paper.md`**
  Closed-form academic defense of the identity claim itself
  (no ethics, no diagnostics, no applications)

* **`IER-theory.md`**
  Conceptual backbone and explanatory integration
  Includes why experience is a regime, not an aggregate
  v10.8 includes: *Why nothing weaker than global intrinsic constraint could be experience*

* **`IER-dynamics.md`**
  Stability, modulation, overload, fragmentation, and collapse of UEFs
  Clarifies dominance as a **dynamical attractor phenomenon**

* **`IER-math.md`**
  Interpretive (non-foundational) formal structure
  Constraint, regimes, choice spaces, and ownership

* **`IER-diagnostics.md`**
  Why experience **cannot be detected in principle**
  Blocks functional sufficiency and empirical creep

* **`IER-slack.md`** *(new in v10.8)*
  Structural impossibility argument showing why
  **informational slack precludes experience**

---

### 🟢 Tier 2 — Necessary Consequences (Derived, Non-Optional)

These documents derive **what necessarily follows** once experience exists.

* **`IER-ethics.md`**
  Experiential standing as categorical
  Moral harm as organizational damage
  Responsibility as graded
  Precaution under uncertainty

* **`IER-agency.md`**
  Agency as owned resolution of intrinsic constraint
  Compatible with determinism

* **`IER-choice.md`**
  Choice spaces and owned traversal
  Narrative and responsibility structure

* **`IER-free-will.md`**
  Dissolution of the libertarian / eliminativist dilemma

---

### 🟡 Tier 3 — Boundary Enforcement & Stress Tests

These documents **do not extend IER**, but protect it from misinterpretation.

They may be read selectively.

* **`IER-denials.md`** — explicit non-claims
* **`IER-contrast.md`** — incompatibilities with adjacent theories
* **`IER-critics.md`** — serious pressure points and accepted costs
* **`IER-puzzles.md`** — dissolution of classic consciousness puzzles

---

### ⚪ Tier 4 — Illustrative Applications (Explicitly Optional)

These documents **demonstrate compatibility and breadth**, not necessity.

They carry **no authority** and may be skipped entirely.

Examples include:

* `IER-art.md`
* `IER-emotions.md`
* `IER-panic.md`
* `IER-psychosis.md`
* `IER-aphantasia.md`
* `IER-brainfeels.md`
* `IER-continuity.md`
* `IER-persistence.md`
* `IER-intentionality.md`
* `IER-meaning.md`

---

## What IER Explicitly Rejects

IER does **not** endorse:

* panpsychism or micro-subjects
* emergence or realization accounts
* functional or computational sufficiency
* representational or semantic primitives
* epistemic authority from experience
* graded or partial subjecthood
* behavioral or empirical diagnostics
* group minds or collective subjects

If a claim is not stated in the Specification or a **necessary entailment** of it,
**it is not part of IER**.

## Status

**IER v10.8 represents a mature, normatively closed framework.**

* The identity claim is fixed.
* The specification is stable.
* Remaining work focuses on **derivation, clarification, and disciplined application**, not expansion.

Future changes must respect:

* normative closure
* non-diagnosability
* categorical subjecthood
* epistemic non-authority

---

**Informational Experiential Realism**

*Experience is real by identity.
Reality remains singular.
Ethics begins wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.*
