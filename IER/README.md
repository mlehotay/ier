# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**

**Current Version:** v10.x  
**Status:** Conceptually complete; normatively closed  

---

## **Overview**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a realist theory of experience that identifies experience with a **specific organizational and dynamical regime** instantiated by certain physical systems.

> **Experience is neither fundamental nor illusory, but identical to a regime of globally integrated informational dynamics under coherent intrinsic constraint.**

IER is strictly **physicalist**, **non-dualist**, and **non-idealistic**.
It introduces **no new substances, forces, properties, or ontological categories** beyond those required by physical law and organizational identity.

Reality is singular.
Experience is plural.
Experiential worlds exist **iff** certain organizational conditions obtain.

---

## **Core Identity Claim**

IER’s central thesis is an **identity claim**, not a causal hypothesis or explanatory gap-bridge:

> **Experience = a Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**
>
> A **UEF** is a physical system operating in a
> *globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential dynamical regime under coherent intrinsic constraint*.

From the outside, a UEF is a lawful physical regime.
From the inside, the *same regime just is an experiential world*.

Nothing is added at the experiential level.
Nothing is reduced away.

## **Canonical Authority**

### **Normative Status**

**Exactly one document is normative:**

→ **`IER-specification.md`**

The Specification fixes:

* all axioms
* all definitions
* all identity conditions
* all necessary entailments
* all ethical consequences that *must* follow

If a claim cannot be expressed using the primitives of the Specification, it is **not part of IER**.

All other documents are **non-normative derivatives**.
They explain, interpret, apply, or clarify—but do not amend—the Spec.

## **Repository Structure**

### **Normative Core**

* **`IER-specification.md`**
  The complete and closed normative core of IER v10.x.
  *Authoritative.*

---

### **Canonical Explanatory Derivations**

These documents unpack the Specification without adding primitives, diagnostics, or obligations.

* **`IER-theory.md`**
  Conceptual explanation of the identity claim, Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs), and the dual physical / experiential description of the same regime.

* **`IER-dynamics.md`**
  Dynamical realization of UEFs: formation, stability windows, breakdown, dissociation, and regime transitions under intrinsic constraint.

* **`IER-math.md`**
  Formal–interpretive tools (constraint, curvature, regimes) clarifying why certain dynamics can support experience.
  *Non-diagnostic, non-reductive.*

* **`IER-ethics.md`**
  Ethical consequences derived directly from experiential identity and intrinsic constraint, including agency, free will, harm, responsibility, and precaution.

---

### **Boundary & Clarification Documents (Non-Normative)**

These documents exist to prevent misinterpretation, overreach, or illicit importation from adjacent frameworks.

* **`IER-denials.md`**
  Explicit non-claims and prohibited inferences.
  Closes predictable misreadings created by IER’s minimalism.

* **`IER-contrast.md`**
  Boundary contrasts with nearby theories (functionalism, IIT, panpsychism, GWT, phenomenology, etc.).
  Clarifies axes of incompatibility without comparative persuasion.

* **`IER-diagnostics.md`**
  Explains why IER **cannot** permit detection, measurement, certification, or falsification of experience—and why diagnostic opacity *increases* ethical constraint.

* **`IER-access.md`**
  Distinguishes **experiential access** from **epistemic access**.
  Shows why experiential depth or authority does not imply truth, correctness, or reference.

---

### **Persistence & Diachronic Structure**

* **`IER-persistence.md`**
  Explains how learning, plasticity, trauma, and recovery occur **within a persistent UEF** without violating categorical onset, unity, or subjecthood.

---

### **Applications / Illustrative Case Studies**

These documents apply IER’s organizational vocabulary to concrete phenomena.
They are **illustrative only** and do not compete with scientific or clinical accounts.

* **`IER-meaning.md`**
  Experiential pluralism, narrative structure, and meaning as stable informational attractors under intrinsic constraint.

* **`IER-psychosis.md`**
  Psychosis as pathological regime instability, semantic collapse, and forced switching under extreme intrinsic constraint.

* **`IER-aphantasia.md`**
  A high-coherence, low-slack experiential architecture lacking voluntary imagery.

* **`IER-brainfeels.md`**
  Internally generated qualitative patterns interpreted as endogenous qualitative stabilizers.

---

## **Recommended Reading Order**

1. **`IER-specification.md`** *(normative core)*
2. **`IER-theory.md`**
3. **`IER-dynamics.md`**
4. **`IER-ethics.md`**
5. Boundary & clarification documents
6. Applications / illustrations as desired

## **Version History (High-Level)**

* **v9.x** — exploratory drafts and partial frameworks
  *(deprecated; preserved in git history)*

* **v10.0** — formal Specification, unified ontology, ethics and mathematics derived from core

* **v10.1** — structural consolidation and clarification (no new claims)

* **v10.2** — applications and illustrative case studies

* **v10.3** — clarification of UEF participation dynamics
  *(explicit distinction between regime transition and participation modulation)*

* **v10.x** — current stable line
  *(normatively closed; clarificatory extensions only)*

---

## **Status Notes**

* The Specification exhausts all normative force.
* No document outside the Specification introduces ontology, obligations, or identity criteria.
* Explanatory documents clarify implications; they do not expand the theory.
* Applications describe phenomena; they do not validate experiential content.
* Diagnostic uncertainty **restricts** permissible action; it does not license experimentation.

## **Summary**

> **Experience is what globally integrated informational dynamics are like when they become the dominant, unavoidable constraint on themselves over time.**

IER offers neither mystery nor deflation—only identity.
Where intrinsic constraint becomes global and coherent, a world appears.
