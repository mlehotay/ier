# Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8)

**A physicalist identity framework for experience, agency, and moral standing**

---

## Overview

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a strictly physicalist **identity theory of experience**.

IER holds that:

- There exists **exactly one objective physical reality**, governed by mind-independent law.
- Within that reality, some physical systems operate as **Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)**.
- When a UEF exists, **experience exists** — **categorically**, not by degree.
- Experience is **real by identity**, not an emergent accompaniment, representation, or functional output.
- **Experiential structure confers no epistemic authority** about mind-independent reality.
- Ethical significance follows **necessarily** wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.

IER is **not** a theory of representation, cognition, intelligence, reportability, measurement, or phenomenological method.

It is a theory of:

> **what experience is,  
> when it exists,  
> and what necessarily follows from its existence.**

## Status of This Document

This README is an **orientation document only**.

It:

- introduces **no ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical claims**
- defines **no authority tiers**
- establishes **no interpretive precedence**
- carries **no normative force**

All authoritative definitions of document roles, tiers, and conflict resolution are specified **exclusively** in:

```

IER-canon.md

```

If any apparent classification, grouping, or description in this README conflicts with the canon, **the canon governs**.

---

## Normative Authority (Pointer Only)

IER enforces **strict normative closure**.

The **sole document** that defines:

- what experience **is**
- when experience **exists**
- what **necessarily follows** from its existence

is:

```

IER-specification.md   (v10.8)

```

No other file introduces criteria, thresholds, sufficiency conditions, diagnostics, or independent ethical rules.

All other documents are **derivative**, **explanatory**, **restrictive**, or **illustrative**, as governed by `IER-canon.md`.

---

## Global Language Constraint (Applies Everywhere)

Across the entire IER corpus, including this README:

> **All informational language is descriptive shorthand only.**

Terms such as *information*, *informational tension*, *informational slack*, *storage*, *processing*, or *transformation* refer exclusively to:

> **physically instantiated state distinctions that modulate a system’s own future dynamics under intrinsic constraint**

No informational primitives, semantic properties, representational contents, or epistemic notions are introduced.

## How the Corpus Is Organized (Non-Authoritative)

The IER repository contains several **functional categories** of documents.  
These groupings are **descriptive only** and do not define authority.

### 1. Normative Core

- `IER-specification.md`

This file is the **exclusive normative foundation** of IER.

---

### 2. Explanatory and Structural Backbone

These documents explain, formalize, or stabilize the identity claim **without adding authority**:

- `IER-theory.md`
- `IER-dynamics.md`
- `IER-math.md`
- `IER-paper.md`

They answer *why* the identity claim has the structure it does and *how* experiential regimes behave, conditional on their existence.

---

### 3. Ethical Consequences and Responsibility

These documents explain what **necessarily follows** from experiential identity:

- `IER-ethics.md`
- `IER-agency.md`
- `IER-choice.md`
- `IER-free-will.md`
- `IER-morals.md`

They do not define standing or criteria; all ethical authority derives from the Specification.

---

### 4. Boundary Enforcement and Misuse Blocking

These documents exist to prevent illegitimate extensions, intuitions, or diagnostics:

- `IER-diagnostics.md`
- `IER-denials.md`
- `IER-contrast.md`
- `IER-critics.md`
- `IER-puzzles.md`
- `IER-slack.md`

They restrict misuse but do not add positive criteria.

---

### 5. Applications and Illustrative Analyses

These documents demonstrate compatibility, scope, and explanatory reach **without authority**:

- `IER-meaning.md`
- `IER-intentionality.md`
- `IER-continuity.md`
- `IER-persistence.md`
- `IER-brainfeels.md`
- `IER-aphantasia.md`
- `IER-emotions.md`
- `IER-panic.md`
- `IER-psychosis.md`
- `IER-art.md`
- `IER-access.md`
- `IER-futures.md`

They may be read selectively and skipped entirely without loss of the core framework.

## What IER Explicitly Rejects

IER does **not** endorse:

- panpsychism or micro-subjects
- emergence or realization accounts
- functional or computational sufficiency
- representational or semantic primitives
- epistemic authority from experience
- graded or partial subjecthood
- behavioral or empirical diagnostics
- group minds or collective subjects

If a claim is not stated in the Specification or a **necessary entailment** of it, it is **not part of IER**.

---

## Version Discipline

- This README reflects **IER v10.8**
- Minor versions clarify but do not expand authority
- Major revisions require an explicit canon update
- Deprecated planning documents are non-authoritative once superseded

---

## Summary

IER v10.8 is a **normatively closed identity framework**:

- experience is real by identity
- reality remains singular
- subjecthood is categorical
- ethics follows necessarily
- epistemic authority is denied
- uncertainty constrains action rather than licensing it

All authority is defined elsewhere.

This document exists only to help you find it.

**Informational Experiential Realism**

*Experience is real by identity.  
Reality remains singular.  
Ethics begins wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.*
