# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**

**Current Version:** **v10.5**  
**Status:** **Normatively closed; explanatorily extensible**  

---

## **Overview**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a realist **identity theory of experience**.

It identifies experience with a **specific organizational and dynamical regime** instantiated by certain physical systems:

> **Experience is identical to globally integrated, temporally continuous informational dynamics operating under coherent intrinsic constraint.**

IER is strictly **physicalist**, **non-dualist**, and **non-idealist**.
It introduces **no new substances, forces, properties, or ontological categories** beyond physical systems and their organization.

Reality is singular.
Experience is plural.
Experiential worlds exist **iff** certain organizational conditions obtain.

---

## **Core Identity Claim**

IER’s central thesis is an **identity claim**, not a causal hypothesis, emergence story, or explanatory bridge:

> **Experience = a Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**

A **UEF** is a physical system operating in a:

* globally integrated
* temporally continuous
* self-referential
* intrinsically constrained
* coherently stabilized

**dynamical regime**.

From the outside, a UEF is a lawful physical process.
From the inside, the *same process just is an experiential world*.

Nothing experiential is added.
Nothing physical is reduced away.

## **Normative Authority**

### **The Specification**

**Exactly one document is normatively authoritative:**

→ **`IER-specification.md` (v10.5)**

The Specification fixes **exhaustively and exclusively**:

* axioms and ontology
* definitions
* identity conditions
* necessary entailments
* ethical consequences that must follow

If a claim cannot be expressed using the primitives of the Specification, it is **not part of IER**.

---

### **Specification Derivatives (Non-Independent)**

These documents do **not** add, revise, or reinterpret the theory.
They exist for **proof, compression, and publication guidance** only.

* **`IER-spec-minimal.md`**
  A deliberately minimal statement of the identity theory, created to guide the development of the primary preprint paper.
  It isolates the **core identity claim** and defers phenomenology and extended interpretation to later work.

* **`IER-spec-norms.md`**
  A formal demonstration that the **Minimal Specification and Full Specification are equivalent** in normative content.
  This document proves that no ethical or ontological commitments are lost or gained by compression.

Neither document has independent authority.

---

## **Canonical Explanatory Documents (Non-Normative)**

These documents unpack the Specification without adding primitives, diagnostics, or obligations.

* **`IER-theory.md`**
  Conceptual explanation of the identity claim, Unified Experiential Fields, and experiential pluralism.

* **`IER-dynamics.md`**
  Regime formation, stability windows, dissociation, collapse, and transitions under intrinsic constraint.

* **`IER-math.md`**
  Formal–interpretive tools (constraint, curvature, regimes) clarifying why certain dynamics can support experience.
  *Non-diagnostic, non-reductive.*

* **`IER-ethics.md`**
  Agency, free will, moral harm, responsibility, and precaution as **necessary entailments** of experiential identity.

---

## **Boundary & Clarification Documents (Non-Normative)**

These documents exist to prevent misinterpretation, illicit theoretical import, or category errors.

* **`IER-intentionality.md`**
  Aboutness, reference, and intentional content understood as **constraint-stabilized organizational patterns** within a Unified Experiential Field, not as primitive semantic relations.

* **`IER-denials.md`**
  Explicit non-claims and prohibited inferences.

* **`IER-contrast.md`**
  Boundary contrasts with functionalism, IIT, panpsychism, GWT, phenomenology, and related frameworks.

* **`IER-diagnostics.md`**
  Why IER cannot permit detection, measurement, or certification of experience—and why diagnostic opacity increases ethical constraint.

* **`IER-access.md`**
  Distinction between **experiential access** and **epistemic access**, and why experiential authority does not imply correctness or reference.

---

## **Persistence, History, and Consequences**

* **`IER-persistence.md`**
  Learning, plasticity, trauma, and recovery **within a single persistent Unified Experiential Field**, without violating unity or subjecthood.

* **`IER-evolution.md`**
  Historical and conceptual development of IER, tracing its refinement from early informational models through Functional Experiential Realism to a closed identity theory.

* **`IER-consequences.md`**
  Systematic mapping of the **ontological, ethical, scientific, and meta-theoretical consequences** that follow from accepting the IER identity claim.
  This document introduces no new commitments.

---

## **Applications / Illustrative Case Studies**

These documents apply IER’s organizational vocabulary to concrete phenomena.
They are **illustrative only** and do not compete with scientific or clinical accounts.

* **`IER-meaning.md`**
  Meaning and narrative as stable informational attractors under intrinsic constraint.

* **`IER-psychosis.md`**
  Psychosis as pathological regime instability and forced switching under extreme intrinsic constraint.

* **`IER-aphantasia.md`**
  A high-coherence, low-slack experiential architecture lacking voluntary imagery.

* **`IER-brainfeels.md`**
  Internally generated qualitative patterns interpreted as **endogenous qualitative stabilizers** within a Unified Experiential Field.

## **Version History (High-Level)**

* **v9.x** — exploratory and functional drafts *(deprecated; preserved in git history)*
* **v10.0** — formal Specification and identity-based ontology
* **v10.1–10.3** — consolidation and regime clarification
* **v10.4** — persistence, agency, and participation refinements
* **v10.5** — intentionality clarification, specification equivalence proof, and consequence mapping

---

## **Status Notes**

* The Specification exhausts all normative force.
* No document outside it introduces ontology, identity criteria, or obligations.
* Diagnostic uncertainty **restricts** permissible action.
* Ethics is an entailment, not an overlay.

## **Summary**

> **Experience is what globally integrated informational dynamics are like when intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable and self-sustaining over time.**

IER offers neither mystery nor deflation—only identity.
Where intrinsic constraint becomes global and coherent, a world appears.
