# Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.6)

*A physicalist framework for understanding experience, meaning, agency, and moral standing without epistemic inflation or ontological excess.*

---

## Overview

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a strictly physicalist identity theory of experience.

IER holds that:

- There exists **exactly one objective physical reality**, governed by mind-independent law.
- Within that reality, some physical systems operate as **Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)**.
- When a UEF exists, **experience exists** — categorically, not by degree.
- Experience is real, costly, meaningful, and identity-shaping.
- **Experience does not confer epistemic authority, truth, or metaphysical insight.**

IER explains **what experience is**, **why it feels the way it does**, and **what necessarily follows from its existence**, while enforcing a strict boundary between **experiential authority** and **epistemic access**.

---

## Repository Architecture

IER is intentionally modular and role-segregated.  
Each document has a **single, non-overlapping function**.

### Normative Core (Authoritative)

#### `IER-specification.md`
**The sole normative authority of IER (v10.6).**

Defines exhaustively:
- what experience **is**
- when experience **exists**
- what **necessarily follows** from its existence

No other document introduces definitions, criteria, thresholds, or ethical principles.

> If any statement in another file conflicts with the Specification, the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void.

---

## Explanatory & Interpretive Documents (Non-Normative)

These documents **derive from** the Specification and introduce **no independent authority**.

### Foundations

- **`IER-overview.md`**  
  High-level introduction and orientation to the framework.

- **`IER-manifesto.md`**  
  Motivational and philosophical positioning of IER.

- **`IER-theory.md`**  
  Conceptual integration of the Specification: unity, intrinsic constraint, participation, and experiential identity.

- **`IER-dynamics.md`**  
  Dynamic behavior of experiential systems: stability, modulation, overload, fragmentation, and collapse.

- **`IER-math.md`**  
  Formal and mathematical interpretation of intrinsic constraint and experiential regimes.  
  Mathematics is **interpretive, not foundational**.

---

### Meaning, Access, and Intentionality

- **`IER-access.md`**  
  Distinguishes **experiential access** from **epistemic access** and explains why meaning, salience, and urgency do not imply truth.

- **`IER-meaning.md`**  
  Meaning, narrative, and experiential pluralism as organizational phenomena.

- **`IER-intentionality.md`**  
  Intentionality as a derived feature of constraint-stabilized dynamics, not semantic representation.

---

### Phenomenology & Lived Experience

- **`IER-emotions.md`**  
  Emotions as stable organizations of intrinsic constraint.

- **`IER-brainfeels.md`**  
  Endogenous qualitative patterns and internally generated experiential structure.

- **`IER-aphantasia.md`**  
  Aphantasia as a high-coherence, low-slack experiential architecture.

- **`IER-panic.md`**  
  Panic and vasovagal responses as regime-preserving strategies under constraint.

- **`IER-psychosis.md`**  
  Psychosis as pathological instability within a Unified Experiential Field.

- **`IER-art.md`**  
  Art and beauty as constraint-shaping and coherence-modulating structures.

---

### Time, Continuity, and Change

- **`IER-continuity.md`**  
  Experiential Regime Continuity (ERC): sleep, anesthesia, interruption, and identity.

- **`IER-persistence.md`**  
  Learning, development, trauma, and deep change without subject replacement.

---

### Agency, Free Will, and Ethics

- **`IER-agency.md`**  
  Agency as constraint-owned resolution capacity.

- **`IER-free-will.md`**  
  Dissolution of the traditional free-will debate under intrinsic constraint.

- **`IER-ethics.md`**  
  Ethical consequences of experiential identity: standing, harm, responsibility, and precaution.

- **`IER-consequences.md`**  
  Systematic implications of IER across ontology, ethics, science, and uncertainty.

---

### Boundaries, Diagnostics, and Clarification

- **`IER-denials.md`**  
  Explicit non-claims and boundary enforcement.

- **`IER-contrast.md`**  
  Incompatibilities between IER and adjacent theories of mind.

- **`IER-diagnostics.md`**  
  Why experience cannot be detected, measured, or certified in principle.

- **`IER-FAQ.md`**  
  Clarifications of common confusions in accessible language.

- **`IER-puzzles.md`**  
  Canonical consciousness puzzles and IER’s structural response.

---

## Recommended Reading Order

1. `IER-specification.md`
2. `IER-theory.md`
3. `IER-access.md`
4. `IER-meaning.md`
5. `IER-dynamics.md`
6. `IER-ethics.md`

This order mirrors the dependency structure of the framework.

---

## Status

**IER v10.6** represents a **stable architectural revision**:

- The Specification is normatively closed.
- Derivative documents are aligned and non-duplicative.
- No further refactoring of the core is planned.

Ongoing work focuses on **clarification, application, and communication**, not revision of identity conditions.
