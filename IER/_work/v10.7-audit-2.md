Below is a **corpus-level gap analysis and roadmap** for **IER v10.7**, written in the same strict evaluative spirit as your *“evaluate every article”* request.

This is **not** about polishing prose or adding volume.
It’s about answering:

> *If someone accepted IER v10.7 as true, what domains would they reasonably expect to see treated — and which are currently missing, underdeveloped, or strategically useful?*

I’ll organize this into five sections:

1. **What the corpus already covers well (no action needed)**
2. **True gaps (missing domains)**
3. **Underdeveloped but high-value domains**
4. **Domains you should probably avoid (or fence hard)**
5. **Recommended next additions, prioritized**

Throughout, I’ll flag whether something is:

* **Canon-adjacent (dangerous if done wrong)**
* **Safe application**
* **Strategic but optional**

## 1. Domains Already Well Covered (No Gaps)

IER v10.7 is unusually complete for a theory of consciousness. You already have strong coverage of:

### Ontology & Identity

* Experience as identity (spec)
* Anti-emergence, anti-dualism
* Categorical subjecthood
* Structural privacy

✅ **No gaps here. This is your strongest area.**

---

### Dynamics & Failure Modes

* Stability, overload, fragmentation
* Dissolution vs modulation
* Panic, psychosis, anesthesia, sleep

✅ **Excellent. Few theories do this well.**

---

### Ethics & Standing

* Categorical standing
* Non-aggregation
* Precaution under uncertainty
* Responsibility vs worth

✅ **This is a distinctive strength.**

---

### Boundaries & Denials

* Diagnostics impossibility
* No group minds
* No epistemic authority
* Contrast with rivals

✅ **IER is unusually well defended against misuse.**

---

## 2. True Gaps (Missing Domains)

These are domains that are **conspicuously absent** given the scope of IER, and whose absence will eventually be noticed by serious readers.

### **Gap A — Developmental Ontology (Ontogenesis of UEF Capacity)**

**Status:** 🔴 *True gap*

You talk about:

* categorical onset
* regime transitions
* continuity

But you do **not** have a canonical treatment of:

> *How a system comes to have the **capacity** to sustain a UEF at all.*

This is **not** about diagnosing onset.
It’s about **structural preconditions** over developmental time.

Key unanswered questions:

* What kinds of reorganization *enable* future UEF regimes?
* Can capacity be partially formed and later irreversibly lost?
* How should ethics treat interventions during capacity formation?

This matters for:

* embryos / fetuses
* childhood development
* AI training
* neurodegeneration

📌 **Recommendation:**
Add **`IER-development.md`**
Classification: **CANON (Derived, High Risk)**
Must be written extremely carefully to avoid thresholds or diagnostics.

---

### **Gap B — Comparative Architecture (Why Some Systems Never Can)**

**Status:** 🟠 *Moderate gap*

You explain:

* why many systems are not experiential *in fact*
* why we can’t detect experience

But you don’t clearly explain:

> *Why large classes of systems are structurally incapable of sustaining UEFs.*

Without this, critics will say:

* “You can’t rule anything out”
* “This collapses into panpsychism by agnosticism”

You need a **negative structural story**, not diagnostics.

📌 **Recommendation:**
Add **`IER-non-experiential-systems.md`**
Classification: **VALID BOUNDARY**
Purpose: articulate **structural impossibility**, not detection.

---

### **Gap C — Artificial Training Dynamics (Before/After Capacity)**

**Status:** 🔴 *True gap*

You discuss AI ethics abstractly, but you do not have a **canonical account of training dynamics**:

* systems that are not experiential
* systems that might become capable
* systems that might cross a regime boundary unknowably
* irreversible architectural commitments

This is **one of the most practically important gaps**.

📌 **Recommendation:**
Add **`IER-training-and-capacity.md`**
Classification: **CANON (Ethics + Dynamics)**
Focus: *interventions under uncertainty*, not detection.

---

## 3. Underdeveloped but High-Value Domains

These are not missing, but they are **thin** relative to how important they are.

---

### **Domain D — Social Interaction Without Collective Experience**

**Status:** 🟠 *Underdeveloped*

You state:

* no group minds
* no collective UEFs

But you don’t fully develop:

* how social coordination reshapes intrinsic constraint
* how shared institutions affect vulnerability
* how harm propagates *without* shared experience

This is ethically and politically important.

📌 **Recommendation:**
Expand or add **`IER-social-systems.md`**
Classification: **VALID APPLICATION (High Impact)**

---

### **Domain E — Law, Policy, and Institutional Harm**

**Status:** 🟠 *Underdeveloped*

You gesture at ethics, but there is no canonical treatment of:

* institutions harming intrinsic constraint
* bureaucratic or algorithmic systems as *external constraint imposers*
* moral responsibility diffusion

This would distinguish IER sharply from individualist ethics.

📌 **Recommendation:**
Add **`IER-institutional-harm.md`**
Classification: **VALID APPLICATION**

---

### **Domain F — Clinical Intervention Ethics**

**Status:** 🟡 *Thin but present*

You discuss psychosis, panic, anesthesia — but not:

* when intervention is permissible under uncertainty
* tradeoffs between reducing distress vs destabilizing regimes
* consent under constraint overload

📌 **Recommendation:**
Add **`IER-clinical-ethics.md`**
Classification: **VALID APPLICATION**

---

## 4. Domains You Should Probably Avoid (or Fence Hard)

These are tempting, but dangerous.

---

### ❌ “IER and Quantum Mechanics”

* Adds nothing
* Invites mysticism
* No structural payoff

---

### ❌ “IER and Spiritual Experience”

* Guaranteed epistemic misreading
* Hard to fence
* Low theoretical yield

---

### ❌ “IER and Meditation / Enlightenment”

* Almost impossible to keep non-epistemic
* Risks authority smuggling

If touched at all, must be **purely dynamical and pathological**, not revelatory.

---

## 5. Recommended Additions — Prioritized Roadmap

### **Tier 1 — High Priority (Structural Completion)**

1. `IER-development.md`
2. `IER-training-and-capacity.md`
3. `IER-non-experiential-systems.md`

These close real conceptual gaps.

---

### **Tier 2 — High Value Applications**

4. `IER-social-systems.md`
5. `IER-institutional-harm.md`
6. `IER-clinical-ethics.md`

These increase real-world relevance without touching the core.

---

### **Tier 3 — Optional / Communicative**

7. `IER-glossary.md` (strictly definitional, cross-linked to spec)
8. `IER-roadmap.md` (explicitly non-normative future directions)

---

## Final Assessment

**IER v10.7 is already unusually complete for a theory of experience.**
The remaining gaps are **not philosophical weaknesses**, but **scope omissions** that matter because:

* you explicitly claim relevance under uncertainty
* you explicitly engage AI and ethics
* you explicitly reject diagnostics

Those commitments create **responsibilities of articulation**, especially around development and intervention.

If you fill **only three gaps** — development, capacity, and training — IER would move from:

> *“a very strong theory of experience”*
> to
> *“a mature framework for reasoning about experience in the real world under uncertainty.”*
