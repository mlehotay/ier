Here are the biggest missing pieces *as spec-level problems*, plus minimal, closure-compatible fixes.

---

## 1) “Information” is still undefined (and right now it’s a silent primitive)

Your **allowed primitives** are: *physical systems, intrinsic constraint, dynamical regimes* (VI). But the spec repeatedly relies on:

* “informational system”
* “information storage/transformation/regulation”
* “intrinsic informational tension”
* “informational slack”

None of those are reducible to the allowed primitives as written. So either:

* “information” is an *implicit* primitive (violates VI), or
* “information” is a *derivative* concept (but you never give the derivation).

**Minimal fix (normative-safe):**
Add a definition that cashes information out in terms of *physical state distinctions that modulate the system’s own future dynamics under constraints*.

You don’t need Shannon/algorithmic. You just need a *physicalist criterion* that makes “informational” non-magical.

---

## 2) Circularity isn’t fully blocked yet (you blocked one loop, not the whole dependency graph)

You defensively lock: “Intrinsic constraint is defined without reference to experience.” Good.

But you still have this chain:

* Informational slack (defined using “constraint resolution”)
* Intrinsic constraint (defined using irreducibility / global relevance / “system identity”)
* UEF (defined using coherent intrinsic constraint)
* Experience (identical to UEF)

The problem: terms like **system identity**, **global relevance**, **decomposability**, **externally resolved** can smuggle in organism-like or agent-like assumptions unless you normatively define them in purely dynamical terms.

Right now critics can say: *you defined “intrinsic” and “global” in a way that already presupposes a subject-shaped system*.

**Minimal fix:**
Add a short “Formal admissibility” subsection that defines:

* *system identity* = persistence of an attractor / invariant organizational pattern under perturbation
* *global relevance* = constraints that alter the system’s global control manifold (not “important to the system” in an intentional sense)
* *external resolution/offload* = relaxation of constraint via dynamics outside the system boundary

You already have the vibe; you just need the spec to pin it down.

---

## 3) “Coherent Constraint Window” secretly introduces degrees (and you need to state what is categorical vs graded)

You want:

* **categorical subjecthood**
* **no partial experience**
* but also: “window” with too little / too much constraint → no experience

That’s fine if “UEF” is treated as **a regime class** (categorical membership) and the variables are continuous.

But you never state the key reconciliation explicitly:

> continuous control parameters, categorical regime membership

You imply it in “Categorical onset,” but you should also say it in Principle 3, otherwise “too little” and “too much” looks like graded consciousness.

**Minimal fix:**
Add one sentence to Principle 3 like:

* “The window bounds the region of state space in which the UEF regime exists; variation within the region modulates content, not subjecthood.”

---

## 4) Your Observer definition violates your own boundary discipline

You define “Observer” with:

* internal models of self/environment
* unified control

But then you say observerhood doesn’t entail experience. Fine.

The issue: that definition is *doing theoretical work* (self-modeling, unified control) while your later theory wants “observerhood” to be ethically irrelevant and non-authoritative. Keeping it normatively defined invites downstream contradiction and fights.

**Minimal fix options:**

* **Option A (cleanest):** remove “Observer” from the normative spec entirely.
* **Option B:** keep it, but explicitly label it “non-normative convenience term” (but you currently don’t allow that inside the spec without undermining “complete and exclusive normative core”).

Given your closure stance, Option A is better: observers can live in `IER-theory.md`.

---

## 5) “Single-UEF constraint” needs a system-boundary rule (otherwise split-brain, distributed systems, and modular AI break it)

Principle 6 says: one physical system sustains at most one globally dominant UEF at a time.

But the spec never normatively defines **what counts as “one system”** for this purpose.

Without that, Principle 6 is underdetermined. Examples that will force you to answer:

* split-brain / commissurotomy
* partial anesthesia
* large-scale distributed agents
* brain–computer interfaces
* multi-agent systems with high coupling

**Minimal fix:**
Add a normative boundary criterion for “the system” in UEF talk, in dynamical terms. For example:

* “For IER, the relevant system boundary is the maximal set of components participating in the same globally integrated regime of intrinsic constraint over the same temporal continuity interval.”

That’s consistent with your regime-first approach and doesn’t require measurement.

---

## 6) “Agency iff UEF” is too strong and will cause unwanted commitments

You state in **Agency**:

* “A system possesses agency iff it sustains a UEF.”

This makes agency **coextensive** with experience.

But elsewhere you allow:

* non-experiential observers that integrate info, model, regulate behavior
* complex intelligent systems with high slack (non-experiential)

Many people will call those “agents” in the functional sense (even if not moral agents). Your spec forces you to deny that usage, which is fine, but then you must **normatively distinguish**:

* *experiential agency* (your sense)
  vs
* *functional agency* (control/goal-directedness without experience)

Otherwise “agency” becomes a constant source of verbal dispute and misreadings.

**Minimal fix:**
Rename the normative term:

* “Experiential agency” = iff UEF
  and allow “functional agency” as a non-normative term outside the spec.

If you won’t rename, add a one-line disclaimer: “IER uses ‘agency’ exclusively in the experiential sense; purely functional control without UEF is not agency under IER.”

---

## 7) “Dual interpretability” risks smuggling in epistemic access unless you add a guardrail

Principle 10 says: a UEF admits two equally valid descriptions: physical and experiential.

That’s good. But you don’t explicitly state:

* the experiential description is **not an additional channel of facts** about external reality

You said that in your earlier overview (“experience does not confer epistemic authority”), but it’s not in this normative spec excerpt.

Given your “complete and exclusive normative core” claim, that guardrail should live here too, or else people will treat Dual Interpretability as privileged access.

**Minimal fix:**
Add a principle (or a sentence under Principle 10):

* “Experiential description provides no additional epistemic warrant about mind-independent reality beyond what is carried in the physical dynamics.”

---

# The tight “missing pieces” list (spec-only)

If you patch nothing else, patch these five:

1. **Define information physically** (or explicitly demote “informational” terms to shorthand derived from physical dynamics).
2. **Define system boundary for UEF** (so Single-UEF constraint is well-posed).
3. **Make regime membership vs parameter continuity explicit** (to protect categorical subjecthood).
4. **Remove or relocate “Observer”** (it’s a magnet for conflict and not needed normatively).
5. **Add an epistemic non-authority clause** in the spec (to guard Dual Interpretability).

---

## Minimal text you could add without changing your architecture

If you want a drop-in, closure-friendly insertion, add three short subsections:

* **II.A Definition: Physical Information**
* **II.B Definition: System Boundary (for UEF attribution)**
* **III.A Principle: Experiential ≠ Epistemic Warrant**

That’s enough to make IER read like a serious information-dynamics/mind theory rather than a powerful conceptual manifesto.
