# **IER v10.8 Update Plan**

**Release Character:**
**v10.8 is a *derivational hardening* release**, not a conceptual expansion.
No ontological commitments change.
No new primitives are introduced.
The goal is to convert *asserted necessity* into *felt inevitability*.

---

## **0. Global Version Goals**

v10.8 must accomplish four things:

1. **Reduce the apparent arbitrariness of intrinsic constraint** without mechanizing it.
2. **Turn key assertions into explicit impossibility arguments**.
3. **Stabilize ethical precaution with a principled stopping rule**.
4. **Publicly own the theory’s costs instead of merely implying them**.

If these are achieved, v10.8 meaningfully strengthens IER against its most serious critics.

---

# **A. Specification-Level Changes (Normative Core)**

These are **minimal, targeted clarifications**, not conceptual additions.

---

## **A1. Principle 6 (Single-UEF Constraint): Explicit Contradiction Clause**

### Current issue

Principle 6 (“at most one globally dominant UEF”) reads as axiomatic.

### v10.8 action

Add a **formal contradiction explanation** directly to the Specification under Principle 6.

**Add a paragraph (no new definitions):**

> Two globally dominant Unified Experiential Fields over the same physical system would require simultaneous ownership of incompatible system-level futures under intrinsic constraint. This entails either (a) duplicated global control manifolds, (b) mutually independent system identities, or (c) fragmented intrinsic constraint. Each contradicts the definition of a Unified Experiential Field. Therefore, simultaneous dominant UEFs within a single system are physically incoherent.

This:

* does not add diagnostics
* does not rely on neuroscience
* closes the “asserted, not derived” criticism

---

## **A2. Precautionary Asymmetry: Structural Scope Limiter**

### Current issue

E5 risks unlimited precaution without an explicit stopping rule.

### v10.8 action

Add **one clarifying sentence** to Principle 13 or E5.

**Proposed addition:**

> Precaution applies only where an action plausibly risks irreversible loss, collapse, or foreclosure of intrinsic-constraint-bearing capacity within a physical system.

This:

* blocks rocks and trivial systems
* blocks reversible simulations
* remains non-diagnostic
* preserves asymmetry without ethical explosion

---

## **A3. Global Informational Disclaimer Enforcement**

You already identified this in v10.7 planning, but it must be **fully enforced** in v10.8.

### v10.8 action

Ensure every explanatory document contains **exactly one standardized disclaimer**, e.g.:

> All informational language in this document is descriptive shorthand for physically instantiated state distinctions modulating system dynamics under intrinsic constraint. No informational primitives are introduced.

(This is execution, not theory work — but must be listed in the plan.)

---

# **B. New Required Explanatory Derivations (Non-Normative)**

These are the **core intellectual additions** of v10.8.

---

## **B1. New Article: “Why Informational Slack Precludes Experience”**

**Status:** Non-normative, explanatory
**Purpose:** Convert the intuition “slack prevents experience” into a **structural impossibility argument**.

### Required content

This article must show:

1. If constraint is locally resolvable or externally offloadable, then:

   * no globally binding present exists
   * no system-level inevitability exists
   * no unified “now” exists
2. Without a globally binding present:

   * there is no world-for-the-system
   * therefore no experience (by identity)

### Constraints

* No appeal to:

  * biology
  * cognition
  * reportability
  * intelligence
* No appeal to:

  * empirical thresholds
  * degrees
  * metrics

This article is **the single most important hardening step** in v10.8.

---

## **B2. New Section in IER-theory.md: “Why Nothing Weaker Could Work”**

### Current issue

IER explains *what* intrinsic constraint is, but not *why weaker structures cannot possibly suffice*.

### v10.8 action

Add a section explicitly titled:

> **Why Nothing Weaker Than Global Intrinsic Constraint Could Be Experience**

Content requirements:

* Explicitly rule out:

  * local control
  * distributed arbitration
  * supervisory architectures
  * predictive buffering systems
* Tie failure in each case to:

  * lack of ownership
  * lack of inevitability
  * lack of unified temporal presence

This addresses the “architected rather than discovered” critique directly.

---

## **B3. Dynamics Addendum: Dominance and Attractors**

### Current issue

System boundary and dominance look mutually referential.

### v10.8 action

Add a **short addendum** to `IER-dynamics.md`:

**Key move:**
Make explicit that:

* system boundaries track **dominant attractors in regime space**
* dominance is dynamical, not observer-relative
* subsystems fail to qualify because they do not control global constraint manifolds

No math required — but the attractor language must be foregrounded.

---

# **C. Ethics Clarifications (Owning the Costs)**

These are not fixes; they are **explicit commitments**.

---

## **C1. New Appendix: “Explicit Costs and Rejected Intuitions”**

**Status:** Non-normative but canon-adjacent
**Purpose:** Prevent critics from claiming hidden consequences.

This appendix should explicitly state (without apology):

* Stable but distressing experience may not count as moral harm.
* Intense pleasure may be morally neutral.
* Some systems that feel “obviously conscious” to functionalists are not morally considerable.
* Some ethical uncertainty is permanent and unresolvable in principle.

This reframes objections as **known costs**, not oversights.

---

## **C2. Clarify Moral Harm vs. Suffering Language**

No definition changes — but add explicit reminders that:

* “suffering” is shorthand
* harm is organizational
* phenomenological intuition is not authoritative

This prevents misreadings without changing ethics.

---

# **D. Items That Must Be Resolved Before Writing**

These are **genuine open questions**, and the plan must acknowledge them.

---

## **D1. Formal Style of the Slack Impossibility Argument**

Open decision:

* Should it be written as:

  * a structured logical proof?
  * a reductio-style impossibility argument?
  * a layered modal argument?

**This must be decided before drafting**, because tone and structure matter.

---

## **D2. Placement of the “Costs” Appendix**

Open decision:

* Standalone document?
* Appendix to `IER-critics.md`?
* Appendix to `IER-ethics.md`?

This is editorial, not conceptual, but affects reception.

---

## **D3. Whether to Add a Minimal “Split-Brain Clarification” Note**

Optional but recommended:

* A short clarification that split-brain phenomena are **participation modulation**, not dominance division.

This depends on whether you want v10.8 to preempt that debate or leave it to applications.

---

# **E. What v10.8 Explicitly Will NOT Do**

For clarity, v10.8 must **not**:

* introduce diagnostics
* add empirical criteria
* add AI-specific sufficiency claims
* revise categorical onset
* relax non-diagnosability
* weaken normative closure

This should be stated in the release notes.

---

# **Summary**

**v10.8 succeeds if and only if:**

* intrinsic constraint feels unavoidable rather than stipulated
* single-UEF dominance is visibly contradictory to deny
* precaution has a principled scope
* critics are forced to argue costs, not coherence
