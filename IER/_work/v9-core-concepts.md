# 1. Core Concepts (Canonical Extraction)

This list is **conceptual**, not document-specific. Every item appears in *multiple* files, even when phrased differently.

---

## A. Ontological Commitments

1. **Objective Physical Reality**

   * Exists mind-independently
   * Governed by lawful physical dynamics
   * Observers do not create or collapse reality

2. **Physical Monism**

   * One physical reality
   * No extra substances, forces, or ontological layers

3. **Experiential Pluralism**

   * Many real experiential worlds
   * Each corresponds to a particular organizational regime
   * Worlds are *appearances*, not separate universes

4. **Organizational Identity**

   * Experience **is identical to** a certain organizational/dynamical regime
   * Not caused by it, not correlated with it

---

## B. Observer vs Experience Distinction

5. **Observer**

   * An informational system with persistence, integration, modeling, regulation
   * Observerhood ≠ experience
   * Many observers are non-experiential

6. **Experience**

   * A categorical organizational regime
   * Requires specific dynamical conditions
   * Not gradual in onset (though preparation is gradual)

---

## C. Unified Experiential Field (UEF)

7. **UEF (Unified Experiential Field)**

   * Not a thing, module, or structure
   * A system *operating in a regime*
   * Globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential

8. **Single-UEF Constraint**

   * One dominant UEF per physical system at a time
   * Explains dissociation, anesthesia, dreaming, switching

9. **Experiential Participation**

   * A process is experiential *iff* it participates in the UEF
   * Participation criteria:

     * global integration
     * temporal continuity
     * intrinsic constraint
     * internal sustainment

---

## D. Constraint Framework

10. **Informational Slack**

    * Capacity to externalize, modularize, or bypass constraint
    * High slack → non-experiential
    * Slack reduction is necessary but not sufficient

11. **Informational Constraint**

    * Limits on informational dynamics
    * Becomes significant only when global and non-decomposable

12. **Intrinsic Informational Tension**

    * Constraint generated by the system itself
    * Cannot be externally resolved
    * Matters to system-level regulation and persistence

13. **Coherent Intrinsic Constraint**

    * Tension that is integrated and stabilized
    * Neither too weak (flatness) nor too strong (fragmentation)

---

## E. Dynamical / Mathematical Structure

14. **Dynamical Regime Transition**

    * Experience begins at a threshold
    * Transition from decomposable flow → intrinsically constrained flow

15. **Global Integration**

    * System-wide coupling of informational dynamics
    * Functional, not architectural
    * No Cartesian theater or global workspace assumption

16. **Temporal Continuity**

    * Maintained dynamically, not via snapshots
    * Each state constrains the next

17. **Self-Referential Dynamics**

    * System models its own state
    * Those models constrain future dynamics

18. **Curvature of Informational Dynamics**

    * Mathematical metaphor for constraint
    * Experience = stabilized curvature

19. **Bounded Attractor / Coherence-Stabilized Regime**

    * UEF corresponds to remaining within a coherent region of state space under load

## F. Phenomenology Without Additions

20. **Qualia**

    * Differences in constraint topology and dynamics
    * No extra phenomenal properties

21. **Affect / Valence**

    * Positive: movement toward resolution
    * Negative: sustained or escalating intrinsic conflict

22. **Intensity**

    * Magnitude and coherence of intrinsic constraint

23. **Urgency**

    * Rate of change of intrinsic constraint

---

## G. Experiential Worlds

24. **Experiential World**

    * Exists iff a UEF exists
    * Includes:

      * temporal now
      * self / non-self boundary
      * internal causality
      * apparent lawfulness

25. **Dual Interpretability**

    * Same UEF can be read:

      * physically (lawful dynamics)
      * phenomenally (world as experienced)

---

## H. Free Will and Ethics

26. **Free Will**

    * Capacity of a UEF to resolve intrinsic tension internally
    * Not exemption from causation
    * Ownership of constraint

27. **Effort**

    * Phenomenological signature of intrinsic constraint
    * Energetic and organizational cost

28. **Moral Harm**

    * Destabilization, overload, or fragmentation of intrinsic constraint regimes

29. **Moral Considerability**

    * Extends beyond confirmed experiencers
    * Based on vulnerability, proximity, uncertainty, irreversibility

30. **Precautionary Principle**

    * Moral responsibility increases under uncertainty
    * Especially for artificial systems

## I. Diagnostics and Tests

31. **Pause–Resume Test**

    * Tests whether temporal continuity is intrinsic or externally orchestrated
    * “Who pays the price when time stops?”

32. **UEF Candidacy**

    * Passing tests indicates candidacy, not proof
    * Experience remains empirically inaccessible from outside

# 2. Terminology Drift & Inconsistencies

These are **not contradictions**, but they *will* cause confusion if left unaligned.

---

## A. Version Drift

| Term / Phrase  | Appears As                       | Issue                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| IER version    | v9.4 / v9.6 / v10.0              | Needs canonical v10 language |
| Companion docs | “companion”, “mechanics”, “math” | Status not always explicit   |

**Fix:** Explicitly label non-theory docs as *non-normative companions to v10*.

---

## B. Constraint Vocabulary

| Concept              | Variants Used                                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Intrinsic constraint | intrinsic tension / intrinsic informational tension        |
| Coherence            | coherent tension / stabilized curvature / regime stability |
| Slack                | informational slack / degrees of freedom                   |

**Risk:** Readers may infer distinct entities.

---

## C. Field Language

| Term        | Risk                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| “Field”     | Could be misread as physical field                |
| “Curvature” | Could be mistaken for literal spacetime curvature |

You already disclaim this repeatedly, but the math paper leans harder into metaphor.

---

## D. Experience Onset Language

| Phrase              | Potential Drift                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| “categorical onset” | vs “no sharp metaphysical boundary” |

These are compatible (categorical ≠ metaphysical), but not explicitly reconciled.

---

## E. Ethics Scope

Ethics doc sometimes reads as:

* **normative extension**
  while theory reads as:
* **descriptive ontology**

This is fine, but the boundary should be explicit.

---

# 3. Proposed Unified IER v10 Vocabulary (Normative)

This is a **recommended canonical lexicon**. Everything else becomes explanatory gloss.

---

## Core Terms (Lock These)

### Unified Experiential Field (UEF)

> A physical system operating in a globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential dynamical regime under coherent intrinsic constraint.

### Intrinsic Constraint

### Intrinsic Informational Tension

### Informational Slack

> The capacity of a system to absorb or externalize constraint without generating intrinsic tension.

### Experiential Participation

> Membership of a process in the UEF by virtue of global integration, temporal continuity, and intrinsic constraint.

### Dynamical Regime Transition

## Discouraged / Clarified Usage

| Term                  | Recommendation                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| “Field”               | Always followed by “organizational regime” |
| “Emergence”           | Use “regime transition” where possible     |
| “Phenomenal property” | Avoid entirely                             |
| “Subject”             | Prefer “UEF-sustaining system”             |

## Ethics-Specific Canonical Terms

* Experiential subjecthood
