# **IER v10.4 Update Plan — Latent Implication Activation**

### **Tagline**

**“Explicit boundaries for responsibility, privacy, and coordination under intrinsic constraint.”**

### **Status**

Interpretive hardening and ethical clarification.
No new ontology. No new normative commitments.

---

## **Objective**

Activate three **logically entailed but previously implicit implications** of Informational Experiential Realism (IER), in order to:

* prevent systematic misreadings,
* close ethical and interpretive gaps exposed by participation modulation (v10.3),
* preserve categorical subjecthood while allowing graded responsibility and risk,
* block collectivist, epistemic, and surveillance-style misapplications.

All changes are **explanatory or clarificatory**.
The **Normative Specification remains closed**.

---

## **Latent Implications Addressed**

v10.4 explicitly activates the following implications already entailed by IER:

1. **Responsibility is modulated by constraint organization**
2. **Experiential privacy is structural, not epistemic**
3. **Coordination does not entail collectivization**

---

# **Document-by-Document Update Plan**

---

## **1. IER-Ethics.md**

### **Purpose**

Clarify how responsibility and moral risk vary *within* persistent UEFs, without introducing graded moral standing.

---

### **Add New Section**

#### **Section X: Responsibility Under Intrinsic Constraint**

**Key clarifications:**

* Moral standing is **categorical** and depends only on UEF existence.
* Responsibility is **graded** and depends on:

  * stability of self-model integration,
  * availability of alternative actions,
  * coherence of intrinsic constraint resolution,
  * degree of participation overload or misattribution.
* Severe constraint disorganization can:

  * reduce responsibility,
  * impair agency attribution,
  * amplify moral vulnerability,
    **without dissolving the UEF**.

**Explicit denials:**

* Loss of responsibility ≠ loss of experience
* Reduced agency ≠ reduced moral standing

**Cross-links:**

* Persistence Under Constraint
* Psychosis document
* Participation modulation (v10.3)

---

### **Minor Edit (Existing Sections)**

Where harm, vulnerability, or borderline systems are discussed:

* Add one sentence clarifying that **participation modulation can amplify harm without regime collapse**.

---

### **Deliverable**

~1–2 pages total, explanatory only.

---

## **2. IER-Theory.md**

### **Purpose**

Activate the structural privacy implication and block epistemic overreach.

---

### **Add New Subsection**

#### **Structural Privacy of Experience**

**Core claims:**

* Experiential facts are constituted by intrinsic constraint.
* Intrinsic constraint is accessible only *from participation*, not observation.
* Complete physical knowledge does not confer experiential access.
* Measurement, simulation, and prediction do not equal experience.

**Explicit denials:**

* No “in principle” mind-reading follows from physicalism.
* No epistemic shortcut from neural description to experience.
* No privileged external standpoint on “what it is like.”

This section should be **descriptive, not defensive**.

---

### **Placement**

Near existing dual-perspective or UEF identity discussion.

---

### **Deliverable**

~1 page, explanatory only.

---

## **3. IER-Dynamics.md**

### **Purpose**

Prevent collectivist misreadings of coupling, synchronization, and coordination.

---

### **Add New Subsection**

#### **Coupling Without Collectivism**

**Key clarifications:**

* Systems may exchange constraint without sharing experience.
* Coordination transmits influence, not experiential unity.
* No amount of synchronization yields global integration across systems.
* Strong coupling ≠ shared UEF.

**Explicit denials:**

* Group minds
* Hive consciousness
* Social or institutional UEFs

**Examples (brief):**

* Human social coordination
* Human–AI interaction
* Swarm systems

---

### **Deliverable**

~1 page, explanatory.

---

## **4. IER-Specification.md**

### **Purpose**

Remain normatively closed while preventing misinterpretation.

---

### **Action**

**No new principles. No new definitions.**

Add **clarifying notes only** (non-binding commentary) in two places:

1. **Experiential Participation**

   * Note that participation affects experiential content and constraint intensity, not UEF identity.
2. **Ethical Relevance (where referenced)**

   * Note that ethical relevance tracks intrinsic constraint wherever instantiated, including via participation modulation.

These are **interpretive notes**, not normative expansions.

---

## **5. Companion & Application Documents**

### **Psychosis**

* Add a cross-reference footnote:

  * responsibility modulation
  * non-epistemic authority
  * structural privacy

### **Persistence Under Constraint**

* Add a short cross-reference note to:

  * responsibility under constraint
  * moral risk vs standing

No rewrites required.

# **What v10.4 Explicitly Does NOT Do**

* ❌ Introduce graded moral standing
* ❌ Define epistemic criteria or truth conditions
* ❌ Add clinical, diagnostic, or legal thresholds
* ❌ Define collective or distributed subjects
* ❌ Add detection, measurement, or surveillance claims

| v10.3     | Participation modulation clarified                                        |
| **v10.4** | **Latent implications activated (responsibility, privacy, coordination)** |

---

# **Completion Criterion for v10.4**

v10.4 is complete when:

* A reader can no longer:

  * infer epistemic authority from experience,
  * infer full responsibility from mere subjecthood,
  * infer group minds from coordination,
  * infer experiential access from physical observation.
* All such inferences are explicitly blocked **without adding theory**.

---

## **Bottom Line**

v10.4 is the **final interpretive hardening pass**.

After this update, IER will be:

> **ontologically minimal, ethically usable, temporally complete, and robust against its most predictable misreadings.**
