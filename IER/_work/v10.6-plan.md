# Master Execution Plan: v10.0 → v10.5 Core Alignment

## Guiding Constraints (Do Not Violate)

Before touching any file, keep these invariants in mind:

* **The Spec is normatively closed**
* **No new primitives**
* **No new necessity claims outside the Spec**
* **No re-derivation outside the Spec**
* **One explanatory spine (Theory)**
* **No duplicate ownership of concepts**
* **Participation ≠ subjecthood**
* **Responsibility ≠ standing**
* **Coordination ≠ collectivization**
* **Experience ≠ epistemic authority**

If a proposed edit violates any of these, it is out of scope.

## Phase 0 — Global Mechanical Pass (All Non-Spec Files)

**Applies to:**
`IER-theory.md`, `IER-dynamics.md`, `IER-math.md`, `IER-ethics.md`

### 0.1 Authority & Status Block (Top of File)

Ensure each file contains:

* Explicit **NON-NORMATIVE** status
* Explicit deference to **IER v10.5 Full Normative Specification**
* Explicit statement:

  > “This document introduces no criteria, thresholds, or sufficiency conditions.”

### 0.2 Uniform Derivation Footer (Bottom of File)

Add verbatim footer:

> *If any statement in this document appears to conflict with the IER v10.5 Normative Specification, the Specification takes precedence and this statement is void.*

### 0.3 Necessity-Language Sweep

Remove or replace outside the Spec:

* ❌ defines, grounds, iff, must, only when, necessarily
* ✅ under IER, given the Spec, corresponds to, is modeled as, is explained as

This is a **search-and-replace + judgment pass**.

---

## Phase 1 — `IER-specification.md` (Normative Core)

### 1.1 Add Normative Boundary Banner (Top)

Add boxed statement:

> **Normative Boundary Condition**
> This document exhaustively specifies the ontology, criteria, and ethical entailments of IER v10.x.
> No claim outside this document carries definitional or normative authority.

---

### 1.2 Circularity Lock Sentence

Add **one explicit sentence** (location: definitions or principles section):

> *Intrinsic constraint is defined without reference to experience; experience is defined by reference to regimes of intrinsic constraint.*

This is defensive only.

---

### 1.3 Experiential Participation Clarification (v10.3-B)

**Section II — Definitions**

* Expand *Experiential Participation* definition to state:

  * participation may vary dynamically
  * UEF identity persists if global coherence persists
* Include **one illustrative example** (non-exhaustive)

---

### 1.4 Principle 14 — Participation Modulation

**Section III — Principles**

Add:

> **Principle 14 (Participation Modulation)**
> Processes may enter or leave the UEF dynamically. Such changes modulate experiential content without constituting a new UEF, provided global coherence remains.

---

### 1.5 Inference Rule — Participation ≠ Dissolution

**Section IV — Inference Rules**

Add:

> ΔParticipation ⇒ change in experiential content
> ≠ UEF dissolution

---

### 1.6 v10.4 Interpretive Notes (Non-Binding)

Add *clearly labeled* notes (not principles):

* Participation affects **content and constraint intensity**, not identity
* Ethical relevance tracks intrinsic constraint **including via participation**

No new axioms. No new rules.

---

## Phase 2 — `IER-theory.md` (Canonical Explanatory Spine)

### 2.1 Title & Role Update

Subtitle to:

> **Conceptual Overview and Explanatory Integration**

Add status sentence:

> *This is the single authoritative explanatory narrative of IER.*

---

### 2.2 Redundancy Pruning

* **Compress** categorical onset sections → pointer to Spec
* **Remove** detailed failure-mode walkthroughs
* **Reduce** ethical inevitability → 1 paragraph + Spec pointer
* **Ensure** coherent constraint window is explained *once*, intuitively

---

### 2.3 Participation vs UEF Identity (v10.3-B)

Add ~1–2 paragraphs explaining:

* UEF = globally integrated regime
* Participation = dynamic process recruitment
* Participation change ≠ new subject

Include:

* attention shift
* sensory dominance change

Optional diagram: UEF boundary + dynamic interior.

---

### 2.4 Structural Privacy of Experience (v10.4)

Add new subsection:

**Structural Privacy of Experience**

Must clearly state:

* Intrinsic constraint is accessible only from participation
* Observation, simulation, prediction ≠ experiential access
* No “in-principle” mind-reading follows from physicalism

No epistemology. No defense tone.

---

## Phase 3 — `IER-dynamics.md` (Behavior & Failure)

### 3.1 Scope Firewall (Top)

Add explicit scope statement:

> *This document explains how already-defined UEFs behave, not what they are or when they exist.*

---

### 3.2 Absorb Failure Modes (If Not Already Done)

* Ensure **all** failure-mode content is here
* Ensure **no standalone authority** remains elsewhere
* (External step: deprecate/delete `IER-failure-modes.md`)

---

### 3.3 Participation Modulation in Dynamics (v10.3-B)

Add explanation:

* local recruitment/dismissal under intrinsic tension
* transient instability vs regime switching
* no violation of Single-UEF constraint

---

### 3.4 Walkthrough Update

Add step where:

* local process becomes globally recruited
* experiential content updates
* UEF remains intact

---

### 3.5 Coupling Without Collectivism (v10.4)

Add subsection:

* coordination ≠ experiential unity
* synchronization ≠ shared UEF
* deny group minds explicitly

Include brief examples:

* human coordination
* human–AI interaction
* swarms

---

## Phase 4 — `IER-math.md` (Formal Interpretation Only)

### 4.1 Title & Status

Rename subtitle to **Formal Interpretation**.

Add strong disclaimer:

> *This document proposes mathematical interpretations of Spec-defined regimes.
> It does not define criteria for experience.*

---

### 4.2 “What This Formalism Does Not Do” Section

Explicit bullets:

* does not detect experience
* does not define thresholds
* does not measure moral standing
* does not establish sufficiency

---

### 4.3 Participation Indicator Function (v10.3-B)

Add:

* ( P_i(t) \in {0,1} ) as participation indicator
* Explicit statement:

  > *This parameter models membership, not existence.*

---

### 4.4 Qualia / Affect Cleanup

* Theory owns phenomenology
* Math only maps structure → geometry
* Remove any “what it’s like” language

---

## Phase 5 — `IER-ethics.md` (Applied Consequences Only)

### 5.1 Title & Status

Rename to:

> **Ethical Consequences and Applications**

Add early box:

> *If the IER Specification is false, everything in this document fails.*

---

### 5.2 Structural Split

Add headers:

* Part I — Ethical Consequences (Explanatory)
* Part II — Agency and Responsibility
* Part III — Applied Domains (Non-Normative)

---

### 5.3 Responsibility Under Intrinsic Constraint (v10.4)

Add 1–2 page section:

* standing = categorical
* responsibility = graded
* modulated by:

  * self-model coherence
  * alternatives
  * participation overload

Explicit denials:

* reduced responsibility ≠ reduced experience
* agency loss ≠ standing loss

---

### 5.4 Participation & Harm Amplification

Add clarifying sentence in existing harm sections:

> Participation modulation can amplify moral risk without regime collapse.

---

## Phase 6 — Final Cross-Document Verification

Run this checklist once:

* [ ] Only the Spec defines experience, UEF, ethics
* [ ] No duplicate coherent-window explanations
* [ ] No math → experience inference possible
* [ ] No ethics sounds additive
* [ ] No collectivist interpretation possible
* [ ] No epistemic authority implied
* [ ] Participation never implies partial subjects

If all are true → **v10.5 is sealed**.

---

## Deliverable Outcome

When complete:

* All v10.0 plans: **satisfied**
* All v10.0 audits (Parts 1 & 2): **closed**
* v10.1–v10.4: **fully implemented**
* v10.5: **architecturally final**

Nothing further is required except:

* presentation
* pedagogy
* optional companion writing
