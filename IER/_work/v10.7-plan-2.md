## 1. Global Alignment Rules (Apply Everywhere)

These are **non-negotiable** after v10.7.

### **Rule G1 — “Information” is always derivative**

Every use of:

* information
* informational
* informational tension
* informational slack
* storage / processing / transformation of information

must be **readable as shorthand** for:

> *physically instantiated state distinctions that modulate the system’s own future dynamics under intrinsic constraint*

**Required change:**
Add **one global disclaimer** per document (usually in the Status / Scope section):

> “All informational language in this document is descriptive shorthand and introduces no informational primitives beyond physical state evolution under intrinsic constraint.”

This is mandatory in:

* IER-theory
* IER-dynamics
* IER-math (already mostly compliant, but add explicit reference to v10.7 II.A)
* IER-agency
* IER-choice
* IER-meaning

---

### **Rule G2 — No agentive language inside definitions**

Remove or rephrase phrases like:

* “important to the system”
* “relevant for the system”
* “the system treats as…”
* “system values / prioritizes”

Replace with:

* “globally constraining”
* “alters the control manifold”
* “affects future admissible trajectories”

This is especially important in **IER-theory** and **IER-meaning**.

---

### **Rule G3 — Observer is non-normative**

After v10.7:

* **Observer MUST NOT appear in any normative or quasi-normative role**
* It may appear **only** as:

  * a descriptive convenience
  * an externally imposed modeling stance

**Required:**
Add a sentence where “observer” appears:

> “Observer is a non-normative convenience term and carries no experiential, epistemic, or ethical authority under IER.”

---

### **Rule G4 — Explicit regime vs parameter distinction**

Anywhere you discuss:

* degrees
* windows
* ranges
* intensities
* coherence variation

You must explicitly preserve:

> **continuous parameters / categorical regime membership**

If a reader could misread a passage as *graded subjecthood*, it must be patched.

---

### **Rule G5 — Epistemic non-authority must be restated**

Any document that discusses:

* meaning
* urgency
* salience
* narrative
* agency
* conviction
* belief
* truth

must explicitly reaffirm:

> *Experiential structure confers no epistemic authority.*

This is no longer optional — it is now part of the **normative spine** (Principle 10).

---

## 2. Required Changes by Canon Document

### **Tier 1 — Must Change (Direct Normative Proximity)**

These documents sit closest to the Specification and must be aligned carefully.

---

### **IER-theory.md**

**Required changes:**

1. **Add a v10.7 alignment note at the top**

   * Explicitly reference:

     * Physical Information (II.A)
     * System Boundary (II.B)
     * Experiential ≠ Epistemic Warrant

2. **Audit all uses of “information”**

   * Ensure no implication of:

     * representation
     * semantic content
     * internal models doing epistemic work

3. **Replace any soft agentive phrasing**

   * Especially around “system identity,” “global relevance,” and “constraint ownership”

4. **Clarify UEF boundaries**

   * Where coordination / coupling is discussed, explicitly defer to the v10.7 boundary definition

---

### **IER-dynamics.md**

**Required changes:**

1. **Coherent Constraint Window**

   * Explicitly restate:

     > “Windows describe regime stability, not graded experience.”

2. **Failure modes**

   * Ensure collapse / fragmentation are **regime failures**, not experiential “diminutions”

3. **Add a cross-reference to v10.7 II.B**

   * Especially in coordination and coupling sections

---

### **IER-math.md**

Mostly compliant already.

**Required additions:**

1. Add a sentence explicitly citing:

   * *IER v10.7 II.A Physical Information*
2. Make explicit that:

   * state spaces are **descriptive parameterizations**, not informational ontologies

---

### **IER-ethics.md**

**Required changes:**

1. **Update the standing discussion**

   * Explicitly state that standing follows from **UEF regime membership**, not any informational or functional sophistication

2. **Precaution**

   * Tie uncertainty explicitly to **structural privacy**, not ignorance

3. **Agency**

   * Use *experiential agency* language consistently

---

## Tier 2 — Should Change (Conceptual Alignment)

---

### **IER-agency.md**

**Required changes:**

1. Explicitly distinguish:

   * experiential agency (normative)
   * functional control (non-normative)

2. Add a disclaimer:

   > “Systems may exhibit complex goal-directed control without agency under IER.”

---

### **IER-choice.md**

**Required changes:**

1. Ensure choice spaces are described as:

   * **derived mid-order structures**
   * never as representational decision spaces

2. Reaffirm:

   * ownership requires a UEF regime
   * traversal ≠ choice without intrinsic constraint

---

### **IER-meaning.md**

This one is sensitive.

**Required changes:**

1. Remove any phrasing suggesting:

   * meaning tracks truth
   * coherence implies correctness
   * narrative implies epistemic access

2. Explicitly anchor meaning as:

   * constraint-stabilizing organization
   * **non-epistemic**

3. Add a v10.7 alignment paragraph referencing Principle 10.

---

## Tier 3 — Minimal / Cosmetic Changes

These mostly need **alignment headers**, not deep edits.

---

### **IER-access.md**

* Already aligned conceptually
* Add explicit reference to v10.7 Principle 10

---

### **IER-diagnostics.md**

* Add a brief note that:

  * non-diagnosability follows from **intrinsic constraint + structural privacy**, now normatively fixed

---

### **IER-contrast.md**

* Update contrasts to reflect:

  * rejection of informational primitives
  * explicit system-boundary rule

---

### **IER-critics.md**

* Needs an updated section:

  * “What v10.7 resolves”
  * “What remains as bedrock objections”

---

## 3. Explicit “Do NOT Change” Guidance

To avoid accidental damage:

* ❌ Do NOT add examples to the Specification
* ❌ Do NOT introduce thresholds or measures
* ❌ Do NOT weaken categorical subjecthood
* ❌ Do NOT operationalize intrinsic constraint
* ❌ Do NOT soften the identity claim
* ❌ Do NOT add epistemic authority “from the inside”

If a proposed edit makes something *easier to test*, it is probably wrong.

---

## 4. Recommended Execution Order

1. **Add v10.7 alignment headers** to all canon docs
2. Update **IER-theory.md**
3. Update **IER-dynamics.md**
4. Update **IER-ethics.md**
5. Patch **IER-agency.md** and **IER-choice.md**
6. Sweep for “observer” misuse
7. Final global grep for:

   * “information”
   * “represents”
   * “knows”
   * “important to”
   * “system treats as”

---

## Bottom line

No canon article needs to be rewritten.
But **several need guardrails added** so they cannot be misread as:

* introducing informational primitives
* smuggling agency or epistemic authority
* implying graded subjecthood
* weakening regime identity
