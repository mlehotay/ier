# IER CANON AUDIT (v10.7)

---

## 🟥 NORMATIVE CORE (by definition)

| Article                  | Classification        | Notes                                         |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **IER-specification.md** | **CANON (Normative)** | Sole normative authority. v10.7 is now clean. |

## 🟦 FOUNDATIONAL / ARCHITECTURAL CANON

These are **indispensable**. If one disappeared, IER would be incomplete or unstable.

| Article                | Classification           | Evaluation                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IER-overview.md**    | **CANON**                | Clean orientation. Safe. Necessary for first contact.                                           |
| **IER-manifesto.md**   | **CANON (Rhetorical)**   | Non-technical but identity-defining. Sets stakes without overclaiming.                          |
| **IER-theory.md**      | **CANON**                | Conceptual backbone. Must be tightly aligned with v10.7 (info demotion, no observer authority). |
| **IER-dynamics.md**    | **CANON**                | Essential for regime persistence, failure, modulation. Clarifies “window” safely.               |
| **IER-math.md**        | **CANON (Interpretive)** | Crucial for legitimacy. Already aligned philosophically; add explicit v10.7 references.         |
| **IER-ethics.md**      | **CANON**                | Non-optional consequence of identity. One of IER’s strongest differentiators.                   |
| **IER-diagnostics.md** | **CANON (Boundary)**     | Absolutely essential. Blocks illicit testing, false confidence, and misuse.                     |
| **IER-contrast.md**    | **CANON (Boundary)**     | Sharpens identity by incompatibility. Necessary for philosophical clarity.                      |
| **IER-denials.md**     | **CANON (Defensive)**    | Extremely important given how easily IER is misread.                                            |
| **IER-critics.md**     | **CANON (Meta)**         | Legitimate self-critique strengthens theory. Should be updated to v10.7 framing.                |
| **IER-puzzles.md**     | **CANON (Resolution)**   | Shows unifying power. Good philosophical payoff.                                                |

## 🟩 AGENCY, CHOICE, RESPONSIBILITY (CORE-DERIVATIVE)

These are **strong**, but conceptually downstream of the core.

| Article                 | Classification        | Evaluation                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **IER-agency.md**       | **CANON (Derived)**   | Necessary to prevent misreadings of determinism and control. Must maintain “experiential agency only.” |
| **IER-choice.md**       | **CANON (Derived)**   | Choice-space framework is genuinely novel and structurally sound.                                      |
| **IER-free-will.md**    | **VALID APPLICATION** | Good dissolution, but not structurally necessary once agency is defined.                               |
| **IER-morals.md**       | **VALID APPLICATION** | Useful for cases. Clearly derivative. No foundational risk.                                            |
| **IER-consequences.md** | **VALID APPLICATION** | Broad implications mapping; not essential but helpful.                                                 |

## 🟨 MEANING, ACCESS, INTENTIONALITY (HIGH VALUE, HIGH RISK)

These are **good**, but the *most likely to be misread*.

| Article                   | Classification        | Evaluation                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IER-access.md**         | **CANON (Boundary)**  | Very important guardrail. Aligns perfectly with v10.7 Principle 10.                                |
| **IER-meaning.md**        | **CANON (Fragile)**   | Conceptually strong but must aggressively restate non-epistemic status. Keep, but guard carefully. |
| **IER-intentionality.md** | **VALID APPLICATION** | Solid reframing. Not foundational. Could be omitted without breaking IER.                          |

## 🟪 PHENOMENOLOGY / SPECIAL ARCHITECTURES

These are **illustrative**, not foundational.

| Article               | Classification                   | Evaluation                                                          |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IER-emotions.md**   | **VALID APPLICATION**            | Strong illustration of constraint attractors. No theoretical risk.  |
| **IER-brainfeels.md** | **VALID APPLICATION**            | Interesting, novel, but niche. Safe if framed as illustration only. |
| **IER-aphantasia.md** | **VALID APPLICATION**            | Legitimate case study. Should not be over-weighted.                 |
| **IER-panic.md**      | **VALID APPLICATION**            | Good regime-preservation illustration.                              |
| **IER-psychosis.md**  | **VALID APPLICATION (Boundary)** | Important for blocking epistemic authority errors.                  |
| **IER-art.md**        | **VALID APPLICATION**            | Insightful but optional. Keep as cultural application.              |

## 🟫 TIME, CONTINUITY, IDENTITY

| Article                | Classification      | Evaluation                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IER-continuity.md**  | **CANON (Derived)** | Necessary to resolve sleep/anesthesia identity worries. |
| **IER-persistence.md** | **CANON (Derived)** | Important for diachronic identity. Structurally sound.  |

## 🟧 FAQ / COMMUNICATION

| Article        | Classification    | Evaluation                                    |
| -------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **IER-FAQ.md** | **VALID SUPPORT** | Useful pedagogically. No canonical authority. |

## ⚠️ ARTICLES THAT ARE KINDA WEAK (STRATEGIC SENSE)

These are **not wrong**, but they are the *first candidates for pruning* if you wanted to tighten the corpus.

| Article                 | Why Weak                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IER-art.md**          | Adds flavor, not structure. Safe but non-essential.                                   |
| **IER-free-will.md**    | Redundant once agency + choice are understood.                                        |
| **IER-consequences.md** | Broad and diffuse; risks repetition.                                                  |
| **IER-brainfeels.md**   | Interesting but could be mistaken for phenomenological privileging if overemphasized. |

None of these *harm* IER — they’re just optional.

## 🧠 FINAL SCORECARD

* **Canon (essential / architectural):** ~14 articles
* **Valid applications / boundaries:** ~14 articles
* **Weak / optional:** ~4 articles

That’s an **excellent ratio** for a mature theory.

---

## Bottom line

After v10.7:

* The **core is extremely strong**
* The **boundaries are unusually well defended**
* The **applications are legitimate and diverse**
* The few “weak” pieces are *optional*, not liabilities
