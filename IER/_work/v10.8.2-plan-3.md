## Highest-impact improvements

### 1) Tighten the “in-corpus but non-canonical” message (reduce ambiguity)

Right now you say **“in-corpus but non-canonical”** and **“introduces no new theory”**. That’s good, but some readers will still wonder “does in-corpus mean it can outrank other docs?”

Suggestion: add one sentence that explicitly binds `IER-book/` under canon/manfiest/spec and under `IER-book.md` for structure:

* “`IER-book/` is *non-authoritative* and cannot override `IER/IER-canon.md`, `IER/IER-manifest.md`, or `IER/IER-specification.md`. It only implements the book structure defined in `IER-book.md`.”

This directly harmonizes with your dependency chain in `IER-publishing.md`.

### 2) Make the build process “operational,” not just conceptual

The “Build Stages (Conceptual)” section is correct—but if someone new tries to run it, they don’t yet know:

* what scripts exist,
* what the entrypoint is,
* what artifacts are produced besides `build/book-input.txt`,
* what the validation actually checks.

Suggestion: add a small **Build Quickstart** section (even if it’s stubby for now), e.g.:

* “`scripts/build.sh` → produces `build/book-input.txt` and render outputs”
* “`scripts/validate.py` → fails if Part boundaries violated”
* “Renderer is `pandoc` / `typst` / etc.” (whatever you’re using)

Even if you don’t want to lock tooling yet, you can still define the *interfaces* (“a script must output `build/book-input.txt`”) and keep implementation flexible.

### 3) Spell out the validation rules you’re implicitly relying on

You already have a strong governance model across `IER-book.md` (structure/TOC), `IER-manifest.md` (membership + ordering), and `IER-publishing.md` (production discipline).

But the README doesn’t yet list the *hard constraints* the validator enforces. A short checklist would prevent silent drift:

* Inputs are **only** from `IER/` + `IER-paper/IER-paper.md` + `IER-book/src/*` (never elsewhere).
* Part membership and ordering match **Parts I–III** in the manifest.
* `IER-book/` must not contain canonical chapter text.
* Preface is included once, and only from the preface source.
* Part boundaries cannot be crossed by rendering or reordering.

This will make the “Renderers do not define structure” statement enforceable in practice.

## Medium-impact improvements

### 4) Clarify what `src/*.md` actually contains

Right now `src/` is described as “structural files / sentinels” but a reader can’t infer whether these files contain:

* only headings and part dividers,
* front-matter metadata,
* legal/disclosure pages,
* or additional orientation text.

Suggestion: add one line per `src/` file explaining its *role* (not content), e.g.

* `00-front-matter.md` — titlepage + edition metadata + authority disclaimer
* `02-part-i.md` — Part I divider + non-authoritative warning banner (if any)

This keeps it mechanical while still making maintenance easy.

### 5) Connect `IER-legal.md` and disclosure posture to publishing rules

You’ve got `IER-legal.md` as a repository-adjacent reference, and `IER-publishing.md` says disclosure is optional and non-authorial.

Suggestion: in README, add a short “Legal/Disclosure” subsection that explains:

* `IER-legal.md` is a **reference** (no authority),
* disclosure text (if used) lives in `src/00-front-matter.md` (or wherever you intend),
* the book can omit disclosure without changing authorship/ownership framing.

This prevents future “where do we put the AI-assistance line?” churn.

### 6) Add a simple “contracts” section for outputs

You mention outputs: `build/book-input.txt`, plus PDF/EPUB/HTML. Good.

Suggestion: define stable output names (even if the renderer changes), e.g.

* `build/IER-v10.8.2.pdf`
* `build/IER-v10.8.2.epub`
* `build/IER-v10.8.2.html` (or a folder)

This pairs nicely with the version/edition mapping rule in `IER-publishing.md`.

---

## Low-friction repo hygiene upgrades

* Ensure `build/` is definitely disposable with a **`.gitignore` entry** (even if already done elsewhere).
* Consider adding a tiny `scripts/README.md` documenting script entrypoints and expected environment variables.
* If you use CI, add a job that runs only **validation** (fast, deterministic) even if you don’t render PDFs on CI.

## One specific wording tweak I’d make

In README you say:

> “The Preface is source material, not a build artifact”

That can read as “preface isn’t included in the book,” even though `IER-book.md` explicitly places the Preface and points to `IER-paper/IER-paper.md`.

Suggestion wording:

* “The Preface is sourced from `IER-paper/IER-paper.md` (input), not generated inside `IER-book/`.”
