# **IER Book — Master Build & Governance Plan (v10.8.2)**

## **Purpose**

This document defines the **single authoritative plan** for:

* how the IER book is structured
* how it is derived from the corpus
* how Pandoc and Make are used
* how structural drift is prevented

It replaces all prior planning notes, partial plans, and informal guidance.

---

## **1. Guiding Principles (Non-Negotiable)**

### 1.1 The Book Is a Derived Artifact

The IER book is **not hand-authored**.

It is a **mechanically derived projection** of authoritative source documents, built reproducibly and validated against drift.

---

### 1.2 Authority Chain (Hard Constraint)

All book-related decisions must respect this dependency order:

```
IER-canon
   ↓
IER-manifest (v10.8.2)
   ↓
IER-book (rules & TOC)
   ↓
IER-publishing (rendering only)
   ↓
Pandoc / Make / output files
```

No downstream document may redefine upstream structure, scope, or membership.

---

### 1.3 Exhaustiveness Rule

The book is:

* **exhaustive** over **Manifest Parts I–III**
* **exclusive** of everything else

Only one exception is permitted:

* the **Preface**, sourced from `IER-paper/IER-paper.md`

---

## **2. What Is Kept vs Changed**

### 2.1 Kept (Confirmed Correct)

* `00-front-matter.md`
  → book front matter only (title, disclaimers, metadata)

* `01-theory.md`, `02-applications.md`, `03-meta.md`
  → **Part boundary sentinels**, not chapters

* `IER-book.md`
  → **book specification** (rules + TOC), not content

* `IER-publishing.md`
  → rendering and production rules only

---

### 2.2 Changed (Unified Resolution)

* No permanently hand-maintained `IER-book.v10.8.2.md` is required
* Instead:

  * **build inputs are generated** from the manifest / book spec
  * **validation is mandatory**
  * drift causes **hard build failure**

---

## **3. Canonical Book Macro-Structure**

The book has **exactly three Parts**.

### 3.1 Canonical Build Order

```
00-front-matter.md
IER-paper/IER-paper.md        ← Preface (non-authoritative)
01-theory.md                 ← Part I sentinel
[Manifest Part I chapters]
02-applications.md           ← Part II sentinel
[Manifest Part II chapters]
03-meta.md                   ← Part III sentinel
[Manifest Part III chapters]
```

No other ordering is permitted.

---

### 3.2 Role of Sentinel Files

Files:

* `01-theory.md`
* `02-applications.md`
* `03-meta.md`

They are **not chapters**.

They exist solely to:

* declare Part boundaries
* anchor TOC structure
* enforce the three-Part constraint

Rules:

* each appears exactly once
* each precedes only its corresponding Part
* content must not introduce chapter-level headers

---

## **4. Role of the Preface (`IER-paper`)**

* Source: `IER-paper/IER-paper.md`
* Status: **non-authoritative**
* Placement:

  * after front matter
  * before Part I
* Validation:

  * explicitly allowed
  * never counted as a chapter

Pandoc treats it as plain content; meaning is enforced by build rules.

---

## **5. Source of Truth for Chapter Membership**

### 5.1 Manifest Authority

`IER-manifest.md` (v10.8.2) defines:

* which documents exist
* which belong to Parts I–III
* which are **explicitly non-book**

The build must be:

* **exhaustive** over Manifest Parts I–III
* **exclusive** of Parts IV–V and all non-corpus material

---

### 5.2 No Implicit Inclusion

Pandoc must **never** infer structure.

The Makefile must **never** hardcode chapter lists.

All inclusion must be **explicit and generated**.

---

## **6. Build Architecture (Canonical)**

### 6.1 Generated Build Input

The build system generates:

```
build/book-input.txt
```

A newline-separated, ordered list of markdown files.

Example (illustrative):

```
00-front-matter.md
../IER-paper/IER-paper.md
01-theory.md
IER-specification.md
IER-theory.md
...
02-applications.md
...
03-meta.md
...
```

This file is the **single input** to Pandoc.

---

### 6.2 Why a Text List

* inspectable
* diffable
* Pandoc-native
* trivial to validate
* avoids monolithic stitched markdown

---

## **7. Mandatory Validation Step**

### 7.1 Validation Goals

Before Pandoc runs, the build must fail if:

* any Manifest Part I–III file is missing
* any non-book file is included
* ordering differs from the manifest
* any sentinel is missing or duplicated
* Preface is missing or misplaced

---

### 7.2 Minimal Implementation

**Scripts**

* `scripts/extract_book_list.py`

  * parses `IER-manifest.md`
  * writes `build/book-input.txt`

* `scripts/validate_book.py`

  * compares:

    * expected = manifest Parts I–III
    * actual = build input
  * exits non-zero on mismatch

---

### 7.3 Makefile Flow (Canonical)

```make
booklist: $(OUTDIR)
	python3 scripts/extract_book_list.py ../IER-manifest.md $(OUTDIR)/book-input.txt

validate: booklist
	python3 scripts/validate_book.py ../IER-manifest.md $(OUTDIR)/book-input.txt

epub: validate
	pandoc $$(cat $(OUTDIR)/book-input.txt) \
	  --toc --toc-depth=2 \
	  --resource-path=. \
	  -o $(OUTDIR)/IER-book.epub
```

Silent success is **not acceptable**.

---

## **8. Responsibilities by File**

### `IER-book.md`

Defines:

* three-Part structure
* exhaustive scope over Manifest Parts I–III
* Preface rule
* TOC with full chapter titles

Does **not** define rendering, layout, or tooling.

---

### `IER-publishing.md`

Defines:

* rendering constraints
* format discipline
* production checklists

Explicitly defers structure to `IER-book.md`.

---

### Makefile

Defines:

* targets
* dependencies
* validation invocation
* Pandoc flags

Does **not** decide content.

---

## **9. Pandoc Usage Discipline**

Pandoc is a **renderer only**.

Permitted responsibilities:

* concatenate files **already ordered**
* generate TOC
* emit HTML / EPUB / PDF

Forbidden responsibilities:

* inferring structure
* selecting chapters
* resolving authority

---

## **10. Output Strategy**

| Format | Role                      |
| ------ | ------------------------- |
| HTML   | fast preview              |
| EPUB   | structural truth          |
| PDF    | archival / citation       |
| DOCX   | optional external editing |

PDF is **last**, after structure stabilizes.

---

## **11. Changelog Policy**

For v10.8.2, record **once**, tersely:

* Preface addition
* three-Part structure reaffirmed
* manifest / book / publishing alignment
* validation added

No forward-looking promises.

---

## **12. Hygiene Sweep Requirement**

Repo-wide search and correction of:

* “division”
* “two parts”
* legacy structure language

Everything must now say:

* **three Parts**
* **manifest-driven**
* **v10.8.2**

---

## **13. Definition of Done**

This plan is complete when:

1. Manifest v10.8.2 cleanly separates book vs non-book material
2. `IER-book.md` defines a three-Part exhaustive book
3. Preface is included and validated
4. Build input is generated, not handwritten
5. Validation fails on any drift
6. Pandoc never infers structure
7. Changelog reflects the change once

---

## **Final Statement**

> The IER book is a **mechanically derivable, validation-first artifact** whose structure is fixed upstream, whose rendering is downstream, and whose build must fail loudly whenever authority boundaries are violated.
