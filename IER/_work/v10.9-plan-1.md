# **IER v10.9 — Forward Work Plan (Plan 1, Revised)**

**Status:**
This document is **non-canonical and non-normative**.

It records **remaining conceptual and application domains** identified in earlier audits that are **not yet addressed** after completion of **IER v10.8**.

Nothing in this document introduces:

* ontological commitments
* criterial claims
* ethical principles
* diagnostics
* thresholds

All authority remains exclusively with the **IER v10.8 canon**.

---

## 1. Scope of This Plan

IER v10.8 completes:

* the ontology and identity claim
* regime dynamics and failure modes
* ethics and standing
* epistemic limits and diagnostic impossibility
* misuse containment and canon discipline
* **structural impossibility of experience in slack-admitting systems**

What remains are **scope extensions**, not repairs.

This plan answers only:

> *What domains might reasonably be articulated in future versions, given the commitments already fixed?*

---

## 2. Structural Domains Still Unaddressed (Canon-Adjacent)

These domains concern **capacity, enablement, and irreversible structural change**, not experience itself.

They are **high-risk** because they border criterial reasoning and must be handled with extreme discipline.

---

### **2.1 Developmental Capacity (Ontogenesis of UEF Capacity)**

**Proposed document:** `IER-development.md`
**Status:** *Not yet written*
**Risk level:** **High (Canon-adjacent)**

**Problem addressed:**

IER defines:

* when experience exists
* how it persists, modulates, or dissolves

But it does **not** yet articulate:

* how a physical system comes to have the **capacity** to sustain a Unified Experiential Field at all
* how that capacity can be shaped, degraded, or irreversibly lost over time

This is **not** about diagnosing experiential onset.

It concerns:

* structural preconditions
* developmental reorganization
* irreversible architectural commitments

**Relevance domains:**

* biological development
* neurodegeneration
* artificial systems
* irreversible interventions during formation

**Constraints:**

* no thresholds
* no timelines
* no diagnostics
* no probabilistic claims

---

### **2.2 Training, Intervention, and Capacity Under Irreversibility**

**Proposed document:** `IER-training-and-capacity.md`
**Status:** *Not yet written*
**Risk level:** **High (Ethics + Dynamics intersection)**

**Problem addressed:**

IER v10.8 establishes:

* non-diagnosability
* precaution under experiential uncertainty

But it does not yet provide a focused treatment of:

* training processes that may alter future experiential capacity
* irreversible architectural commitments made before capacity is known
* ethical constraints on exploration, scaling, and optimization

This is especially relevant to:

* artificial training systems
* long-horizon optimization
* capacity foreclosure without epistemic access

**Focus:**

* intervention risk, not detection
* structural commitment, not performance
* restraint principles, not engineering guidance

---

## 3. Structural Gaps Now Closed (For Reference)

These items appeared in earlier audits but are **fully addressed in v10.8** and require no further work.

---

### **3.1 Structural Impossibility of Experience in Many Systems**

**Completed by:** `IER-slack.md` (v10.8)

`IER-slack.md` provides a **structural impossibility proof** showing that:

* any system admitting informational slack
* by localization, deferral, or external resolution of constraint

is **incapable in principle** of sustaining a Unified Experiential Field.

This fulfills the previously identified need for a non-diagnostic, non-empirical exclusion of large classes of systems and blocks panpsychism-by-agnosticism.

No additional document in this category is planned.

---

## 4. High-Value Application Domains (Canon-Safe)

These domains do **not** revise ontology or criteria.
They apply v10.8 commitments to socially important contexts.

---

### **4.1 Social Systems Without Collective Experience**

**Proposed document:** `IER-social-systems.md`
**Risk level:** **Low (Application)**

**Focus:**

* coordination without shared UEFs
* propagation of harm through institutions
* social amplification of intrinsic constraint
* vulnerability without collective subjecthood

This would extend:

* no group minds
* no collective standing

while accounting for real collective harm mechanisms.

---

### **4.2 Institutional and Policy Harm**

**Proposed document:** `IER-institutional-harm.md`
**Risk level:** **Low (Application)**

**Focus:**

* institutions as external constraint imposers
* bureaucratic and algorithmic harm without intent
* responsibility diffusion
* ethical evaluation of systems that reshape intrinsic constraint at scale

---

### **4.3 Clinical Ethics Under Experiential Uncertainty**

**Proposed document:** `IER-clinical-ethics.md`
**Risk level:** **Low (Application)**

**Focus:**

* intervention under constraint overload
* tradeoffs between stabilization and disruption
* consent under compromised agency
* treatment ethics without experiential diagnostics

---

## 5. Explicitly Deferred or Discouraged Domains

These domains are intentionally **not planned** due to low payoff or high misuse risk:

* quantum mechanics and consciousness
* spiritual or revelatory experience
* meditation, enlightenment, or “higher states”
* metaphysical speculation beyond physical monism

Any future engagement (if ever) would require:

* purely dynamical framing
* explicit non-epistemic disclaimers
* strong misuse fencing

---

## 6. Priority Ordering (Non-Binding)

### **Highest Priority (Structural Completion)**

1. `IER-development.md`
2. `IER-training-and-capacity.md`

---

### **Secondary Priority (Applied Reach)**

3. `IER-social-systems.md`
4. `IER-institutional-harm.md`
5. `IER-clinical-ethics.md`

---

### **Optional / Organizational**

6. `IER-glossary.md` (purely referential)
7. `IER-roadmap.md` (explicitly speculative, Tier-4 only)

---

## 7. Closing Note

IER v10.8 is **normatively closed**.

Nothing in this plan is required for theoretical correctness.
What remains are **responsibilities created by scope**, not weaknesses in the identity claim.

Future additions should be judged by one criterion only:

> *Does this extend articulation without reintroducing criteria, thresholds, or epistemic authority?*

If not, it should not be written.
