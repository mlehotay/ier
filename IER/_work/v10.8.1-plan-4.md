## 1. Executive Verdict

**Yes — the 10 files are internally consistent.**
There are **no contradictions**, **no hidden reintroductions of forbidden primitives**, and **no places where non-normative documents silently do normative work**.

The corpus is not just consistent — it is **redundantly constrained**. The same exclusions (no diagnostics, no aggregation, no graded subjecthood, no epistemic authority) are independently derived in multiple documents, which is exactly what you want for a theory this strict.

What remains is not conceptual repair, but:

* **clarification density tuning**
* **edge-case anticipation**
* **reader-path smoothing**
* **one or two terminological tightening passes**

Nothing requires reopening the identity claim.

## 2. Internal Consistency Audit (Cross-Document)

### A. Specification vs. Everything Else

**Status: Clean**

`IER-specification.md` is respected everywhere as the *sole* source of:

* experiential identity
* existence conditions
* ethical standing
* precaution scope

No other document:

* introduces thresholds
* implies diagnostics
* smuggles in epistemic authority
* weakens categorical onset

This holds across theory, dynamics, math, slack, diagnostics, ethics, canon, manifest, and abstracts .

**Especially good sign:**
Even documents that *feel* like they could drift (ethics, diagnostics) repeatedly re-anchor themselves explicitly to Specification principles rather than paraphrasing them loosely.

---

### B. Theory ↔ Dynamics ↔ Math

**Status: Strong triangulation**

These three do complementary work without overlap or drift:

* **Theory** explains *why* weaker accounts fail (identity-level necessity)
* **Dynamics** explains *how* an already-existing UEF behaves over time
* **Math** shows the same structure in formal terms without adding testability or metrics

Key checks:

| Potential Risk                               | Outcome            |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Attractor talk sneaking in graded experience | Avoided explicitly |
| Math introducing hidden criteria             | Avoided            |
| Dynamics implying detectability              | Explicitly blocked |
| Theory implying epistemic authority          | Explicitly denied  |

The “attractor but not identical to attractor” clarification appears **consistently** in dynamics and math, which is important.

---

### C. Slack ↔ Diagnostics ↔ Ethics

**Status: Exceptionally well-aligned**

These three documents form a tight exclusionary triangle:

* `IER-slack.md` shows **why experience is structurally impossible** when slack exists
* `IER-diagnostics.md` shows **why slack and non-slack systems are observationally indistinguishable**
* `IER-ethics.md` shows **why uncertainty strengthens obligation without licensing explosion**

There is no circularity:

* Slack does **not** depend on ethics.
* Ethics does **not** depend on detectability.
* Diagnostics does **not** smuggle in moral heuristics.

This is one of the strongest parts of the corpus.

---

### D. Canon & Manifest

**Status: Functionally correct, doing real work**

`IER-canon.md` is not decorative — it actually constrains tone, scope, and authority across the corpus, and those constraints are obeyed in practice .

`IER-manifest.md` correctly classifies tiers and does not mislabel any document’s authority .

**One small note:** the manifest labels `IER-theory`, `IER-dynamics`, `IER-math`, `IER-slack`, and `IER-ethics` as T1. This is fine *because* they introduce no new authority — but some readers will expect T1 to mean “normative.” You handle this via repeated disclaimers, but see improvement suggestions below.

---

### E. Abstracts

**Status: Faithful summaries**

`IER-abstracts.md` does not over-promise, simplify incorrectly, or reintroduce forbidden ideas. It is surprisingly precise for an abstracts document .

The risk here is usually **epistemic creep** (“IER explains X, therefore X is true”). You avoid that.

---

## 3. Gaps, Pressure Points, and Improvements

None of these are fatal. Think of them as **final polish opportunities**.

---

### 1. One Terminological Pressure Point: “Ownership”

Across documents, *ownership* is used carefully — but it is doing a lot of work.

You consistently mean:

> **where unavoidable organizational cost is borne**

This is stated clearly in diagnostics and ethics, but in theory/dynamics it sometimes appears without immediate re-glossing.

**Suggestion:**
Add **one canonical sentence** (copied verbatim) in:

* `IER-theory.md`
* `IER-dynamics.md`

Something like:

> “Ownership refers exclusively to where unavoidable organizational cost is borne, not to psychological authorship, reportability, or narrative self-ascription.”

This reduces the chance of readers importing folk notions of ownership.

---

### 2. Reader Path Load (Not Conceptual, but Real)

You’ve done a good job preventing misuse, but the **entry cost is high**.

A reader encountering:

* non-diagnosability
* categorical standing
* precautionary asymmetry

*before* fully internalizing the identity claim may experience moral vertigo.

You partially address this with `IER-dont-panic.md`, but that document sits late in the manifest.

**Suggestion (non-normative):**
Add a **very short “Orientation Note”** at the top of:

* `IER-diagnostics.md`
* `IER-ethics.md`

You already do this informally, but a standardized “Why this feels severe” paragraph would further satisfy Canon G6.

---

### 3. Explicit Edge Case: Artificial Self-Inspection

You block diagnostics via third-person observables. A predictable next objection is:

> “What about a system introspecting its own constraint structure?”

You implicitly answer this (structural privacy ≠ introspective access), but it’s scattered.

**Suggestion:**
Add **one explicit paragraph** in `IER-diagnostics.md` clarifying that:

* internal monitoring does not equal ownership of constraint
* self-modeling does not collapse structural privacy
* recursive access does not bypass global non-factorability

This would preempt a very common AI-theory objection.

---

### 4. Minor Redundancy You *Could* Trim (Optional)

Some readers will notice repeated lists:

* “no diagnostics, no thresholds, no sufficiency conditions…”
* “no graded subjecthood, no aggregation…”

This repetition is not wrong — it’s defensive — but once the corpus is stable, you could:

* keep full lists in Canon + Specification
* slightly compress them elsewhere

This is stylistic, not conceptual.
