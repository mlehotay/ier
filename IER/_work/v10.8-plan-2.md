
## 4. Book-Level Stabilization (IER-book)

At v10.8, the book should be treated as a **compiled corpus**, not a narrative project.

### What needs to be done

* Ensure **part-level framing** enforces dependency order:

  ```
  Identity
  → Constraint
  → UEF
  → Phenomenology (demonstration only)
  → Time
  → Meaning
  → Agency
  → Ethics
  → Limits
  ```
* Remove or demote anything that:

  * duplicates the core
  * adds rhetorical surface area
  * weakens auditability

This is where:

* lean canon
* placeholder discipline
* “compiled, not rewritten” really matters
