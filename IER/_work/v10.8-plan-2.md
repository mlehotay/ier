## 3. Canon Alignment & Guardrails (Large Surface Area, Low Conceptual Risk)

This is mostly **discipline, not invention**.

### Global rules to enforce everywhere

* Information is **always derivative**
* No agentive language inside definitions
* Observer is **non-normative**
* Continuous parameters ≠ graded subjecthood
* Experiential structure ≠ epistemic authority

These are already identified — the work is **systematic enforcement**.

### Documents needing real attention

**Tier 1 (must align carefully):**

* `IER-theory.md`
* `IER-dynamics.md`
* `IER-ethics.md`

**Tier 2 (patches, not rewrites):**

* `IER-agency.md`
* `IER-choice.md`
* `IER-meaning.md`

**Tier 3 (headers + references):**

* `IER-access.md`
* `IER-diagnostics.md`
* `IER-contrast.md`
* `IER-critics.md`

📌 None of these should introduce new ideas — only prevent misreadings.

## 4. Book-Level Stabilization (IER-book)

At v10.8, the book should be treated as a **compiled corpus**, not a narrative project.

### What needs to be done

* Ensure **part-level framing** enforces dependency order:

  ```
  Identity
  → Constraint
  → UEF
  → Phenomenology (demonstration only)
  → Time
  → Meaning
  → Agency
  → Ethics
  → Limits
  ```
* Remove or demote anything that:

  * duplicates the core
  * adds rhetorical surface area
  * weakens auditability

This is where:

* lean canon
* placeholder discipline
* “compiled, not rewritten” really matters

## 5. What Is Explicitly *Not* v10.8 Work

This is important for focus.

**Not in scope for v10.8:**

* developmental ontology (ontogenesis of capacity)
* AI training dynamics
* social systems / institutions
* clinical ethics expansion

Those are **real gaps**, but they are **v10.9+ material** once v10.8 is locked.

v10.8’s job is to make the existing commitments **ineluctable**, not broader.

## Recommended Execution Order (Concrete)

5. Enforce global alignment rules across Tier 1 & 2 docs
6. Update **IER-book** framing to reflect lean v10.8 canon
7. Final global sweep for:

   * “information”
   * agentive phrasing
   * observer misuse
   * graded-experience ambiguity
