## What This Is

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a strictly physicalist **identity theory of experience**.

IER holds that:

* There exists **exactly one objective physical reality**, governed by mind-independent law.
* Within that reality, some physical systems operate as **Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)**.
* When a UEF exists, **experience exists** — **categorically**, not by degree.
* Experience is **real by identity**, not an emergent accompaniment, representation, or functional output.
* **Experiential structure confers no epistemic authority** about mind-independent reality.
* Ethical significance follows **necessarily** wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.

IER is **not** a theory of representation, cognition, intelligence, reportability, diagnostics, or phenomenological method.

It is a theory of:

> **what experience is,
> when it exists,
> and what necessarily follows from its existence.**

## 1. IER-specification.md

## **Full Normative Specification**

## **0. Status, Scope, and Normative Authority**

### **Normative Boundary Condition**

This document defines the **complete and exclusive normative core** of
**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.1)**.

It specifies **exhaustively**:

* what experience **is**
* when experience **exists**
* what **necessarily follows** from its existence

No claim outside this document carries **definitional, criterial, or ethical authority**.

All other IER documents — theory, dynamics, mathematics, ethics applications, diagnostics, or commentary — are **non-normative derivatives**. They introduce **no criteria, thresholds, sufficiency conditions, or necessity claims**.

> **If any statement in another IER document conflicts with this Specification, the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void.**

---

## 2. IER-theory.md

## **1. Role of Theory in IER**

IER enforces a strict separation between:

* **normative specification**, and
* **explanatory theory**

The Specification defines:

* what experience **is**
* when experience **exists**
* what **necessarily follows** from its existence

This document exists solely to:

* explain how those commitments cohere
* show why weaker interpretations fail
* prevent systematic misreadings
* convert apparent stipulation into structural inevitability

Nothing in this document can revise, soften, or extend the Specification.

---

## 3. IER-dynamics.md

## **1. Role of a Dynamics Document in IER**

The purpose of `IER-dynamics` is to explain:

* how **globally integrated experiential regimes behave once they exist**
* how **stability is maintained** under intrinsic constraint
* how **experiential content changes without subject replacement**
* how **instability, overload, and collapse arise** without redefining experience
* why **system boundaries and dominance are dynamical facts**, not observer conventions

This document answers **how experience behaves**, not **when it exists**.

It presupposes the ontology fixed in the Specification and **adds no independent authority**.

## 4. IER-ethics.md

## **Status and Normative Authority**

**This document is NON-NORMATIVE.**

It explains the **ethical consequences and applications** that follow *necessarily* from the ontology and principles fixed **exclusively** in the:

```
IER-specification.md   (v10.8.1)
```

This document:

* introduces **no new axioms or principles**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or sufficiency conditions**
* introduces **no independent moral obligations**
* does **not** determine when experience exists
* does **not** define moral standing

All ethical authority resides **exclusively** in the Specification.

> **If the IER v10.8.1 Specification is false, everything in this document fails.**
> **If any statement here conflicts with the Specification, the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void.**

## 5. IER-math.md

**Version 10.8 — Mathematical Support Document**

## **Status and Authority**

This document is **supportive and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces no new ontological primitives
* introduces no empirical or diagnostic criteria
* introduces no epistemic access claims
* introduces no ethical rules

All ontological and normative authority resides exclusively in:

* `IER-specification.md`
* `IER-theory.md`
* `IER-dynamics.md`
* `IER-ethics.md`

The purpose of this document is to express the IER identity claim using **formal structural tools**—sets, relations, graphs, and closure—while remaining fully consistent with the core framework.

## 6. IER-meaning.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8) affirms **physical monism**: there exists exactly one objective physical reality governed by mind-independent law. At the same time, IER entails **experiential pluralism**: many distinct, internally lawful experiential worlds may exist simultaneously as organizational regimes within that single reality.

This document explains how **meaning**, **narrative recurrence**, and **stable forms of significance** arise under experiential pluralism without invoking idealism, symbolic realism, or ontological inflation. Under IER, Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs) do not generate reality; they generate **worlds-for-systems** — coherent experiential regimes structured by intrinsic constraint.

Meaning is shown to be an **organizational phenomenon**: a stable way intrinsic constraint is structured such that a system can continue coherently over time. Narrative, instinct, and cultural symbolism are explained as **constraint-stabilizing attractors** that recur because only limited organizational forms remain viable under persistent intrinsic constraint.

Meaning is experientially real and identity-shaping, while remaining strictly **non-epistemic** and **non-ontological**.

## 7. IER-psychosis.md

## **Abstract**

Psychosis involves a characteristic breakdown of agency attribution, meaning regulation, and relevance filtering, often accompanied by compelling narratives of control, instruction, communication, and discovery.

Under **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8)**, psychosis is understood as a **pathological dynamical regime** occurring **within a persisting Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**. Experience continues, but intrinsic constraint becomes extreme, informational slack collapses, and salience assignment loses calibration. As a result, internally generated constraint is **misattributed** to environmental cues, bodily sensations, symbolic structures, or imagined agents.

This document explains how psychotic phenomena can be **described structurally**—without epistemic endorsement—using IER’s concepts of intrinsic constraint, participation modulation, semantic error, and agency mislocalization.

Psychosis is treated neither as revelation nor as ontological transition, but as **organizational failure under constraint**.

## 8. IER-brainfeels.md

## **Abstract**

This document examines a class of internally generated qualitative experiences referred to as **brainfeels**: recurring experiential patterns that feel sensory-like—often described using textures, temperatures, materials, tastes, or smell-adjacent qualities—yet are **not perceptual**, **not representational**, and **not externally attributed**.

Within **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8)**, brainfeels are interpreted as **endogenous qualitative stabilizers**: recurring organizations of intrinsic informational tension that arise entirely within a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** and contribute to its ongoing coherence via **participation modulation**.

Brainfeels demonstrate that qualitative structure need not be object-directed, sensory, or externally anchored to be real, stable, and experientially significant—while remaining strictly **non-epistemic**.

---

## 9. IER-aphantasia.md

## **Abstract**

This article describes a stable experiential architecture characterized by the absence of voluntary sensory imagery, selectively deployed inner speech, strictly single-channel experiential dominance, and emotionally rich but indirectly accessed affective structure. Emotional content typically enters experience through interoceptive signals, symbolic mediation, or delayed conceptual integration rather than immediate perceptual feeling.

Under Informational Experiential Realism (IER), this organization is interpreted as a **coherent Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** whose architecture **excludes imagistic buffering and parallel experiential participation pathways**. Because perceptual simulation and concurrent experiential streams are unavailable to waking participation, intrinsic constraint must stabilize through alternative organizational routes. One such route—examined separately—is the emergence of *brainfeels* as **endogenous qualitative stabilizers**.

This architecture illustrates how phenomenological diversity arises from **differences in constraint organization**, not from differences in experiential standing.

---

## 10. IER-access.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8) identifies experience with the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous dynamical regime operating under coherent intrinsic constraint.

From within such a regime, experience is unified, structured, meaningful, urgent, and often compelling. From outside it, the same regime is a lawful physical organization.

This document articulates an access distinction implicit throughout IER and now normatively constrained by Principle 10: the separation between **experiential access** (what it is like to bear intrinsic constraint) and **epistemic access** (whether beliefs correctly track objective reality). IER entails **no necessary connection** between the two.

Making this boundary explicit explains why costly, coherent, identity-defining experiences often feel authoritative from within a UEF, while showing why such authority is **organizational rather than epistemic**. Intrinsic constraint tracks viability and continuation under constraint, not truth, correctness, or reference. This prevents a recurrent error: treating experiential depth or inevitability as epistemic privilege, and thereby mistaking meaning for knowledge.

---

## 11. IER-persistence.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.x) holds that experience exists if and only if a physical system sustains a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous dynamical regime under coherent intrinsic constraint. Entry into such a regime is categorical, and experiential subjecthood is binary. At the same time, lived experience clearly changes over time through learning, development, trauma, and recovery.

This article explains how **deep experiential change is possible without violating categorical onset, identity conditions, or the unity of experience**. It distinguishes between (1) the persistence of a UEF as an experiential subject and (2) changes in the **organization and participation of processes within that UEF**. Under IER, learning and plasticity are understood as reorganizations of intrinsic constraint and dynamic recruitment or dismissal of participating processes, not as the creation of new subjects or partial experiential entities.

The article clarifies which forms of change are compatible with UEF persistence and which require categorical regime transition. It shows how shifts in salience, affect, narrative structure, agency, and qualitative character can arise through participation modulation while global experiential coherence is maintained.

This document introduces no new primitives and makes no claims beyond those implied by intrinsic constraint, experiential participation, and temporal continuity. Its purpose is to complete the **diachronic account of experience** under IER without expanding its normative core.

## 12. IER-denials.md

## **Why a Denials Document Is Necessary**

IER is deliberately minimal, physicalist, and structural.

That minimalism creates a predictable risk:
readers import assumptions from adjacent frameworks—epistemology, phenomenology, psychology, mysticism, AI theory, ethics—and treat them as implied.

This document closes that gap.

> **If a claim is not explicitly stated in the Specification, and not a necessary entailment of its definitions, it is not part of IER.**

What follows is a representative, high-coverage list of **explicit non-claims**.

---

## IER-diagnostics.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8) identifies experience with the existence of a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous dynamical regime operating under **coherent intrinsic constraint**.

This document explains why IER **cannot license experiential diagnostics in principle**. The impossibility does not arise from technological limits, incomplete data, or unresolved theory. It follows directly from how **intrinsic constraint** and **UEF attribution** are defined.

Intrinsic constraint concerns **where unavoidable organizational cost is borne** — whether a system must internally sustain and resolve its own globally binding dynamics without externalization, buffering, or offloading. This is a **global structural property** of a regime, not a property of outputs, signals, performances, or reports, and is therefore **underdetermined by all third-person observables**.

Combined with **structural privacy**, this entails a specific form of non-diagnosability: systems that differ in experiential status can be made **externally indistinguishable in principle**. IER responds to this limitation not with permissiveness, but with **precaution**. Where experience may exist but cannot be certified, uncertainty **restricts action rather than licensing it** (Specification Principle 13, scoped).

---

## IER-contrast.md

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8) identifies experience with a **specific organizational and dynamical regime** instantiated by certain physical systems: a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** operating under **coherent intrinsic constraint**.

This identity claim entails commitments that sharply distinguish IER from many neighboring theories of mind, consciousness, life, and cognition. The contrasts below do not argue for IER’s correctness. They specify **points of incompatibility**—claims that cannot coexist with IER without abandoning its core commitments.

---

## IER-agency.md

## **Abstract**

Agency is often treated either as a metaphysical power that transcends physical law or as an illusion generated by deterministic processes. Informational Experiential Realism (IER) rejects both framings.

Under IER, **agency is a derived organizational capacity** of systems that sustain a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: the capacity to resolve **intrinsic constraint** through the system’s own **globally integrated dynamics**. Agency does not require indeterminism, rational deliberation, or representational choice. Nor is it eliminated by physical determinism.

This document explains agency as **owned resolution of intrinsic constraint** operating over structured sets of admissible futures (*choice spaces*). It clarifies why agency admits of **degrees**, how it is affected by coercion and overload, and why loss of agency does **not** imply loss of experience or standing.

---

## IER-continuity.md

## Abstract

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identifies experience with the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous dynamical regime operating under coherent intrinsic constraint. Because UEFs are regime-level phenomena, they may dissolve, reconfigure, or re-form over time. This raises an apparent puzzle: if experience ceases during dreamless sleep or anesthesia and later resumes, does this imply repeated death and rebirth of the subject?

This article argues that the puzzle arises from a category error. Under IER, **experience is regime-bound, while personal identity is system-bound**. We introduce the concept of **Experiential Regime Continuity (ERC)** to formalize the distinction between temporary regime interruption and irreversible loss of experiential capacity. Using this framework, we analyze anesthesia, sleep, dreaming, coma, catatonia, and daydreaming, and sharply distinguish them from death. We show that waking from dreamless sleep is not rebirth, that experiential gaps do not threaten identity, and that moral significance tracks the preservation or annihilation of intrinsic constraint-bearing capacity rather than uninterrupted experience.

## IER-free-will.md

## **Abstract**

The traditional free-will debate is framed as a conflict between **libertarianism**, which treats freedom as requiring indeterminism, and **eliminativism**, which treats lawful causation as incompatible with genuine choice. Informational Experiential Realism (IER) rejects the shared assumption underlying both positions.

IER dissolves the free-will problem by distinguishing **branching**, **choice spaces**, **traversal**, and **ownership**. Physical systems may exhibit branching futures without agency, and lawful dynamics may fully support responsibility. What matters is not whether events are determined, but **whether the collapse of alternatives is owned from within a unified experiential system**.

This document explains why indeterminism is neither necessary nor sufficient for choice, why determinism does not eliminate responsibility, and why the free-will problem arises from a category error about what choice is.

## IER-intentionality.md

## Abstract

Intentionality is traditionally treated as the mind’s capacity to be *about* the world: to refer, represent, or carry content with truth conditions. Informational Experiential Realism (IER) rejects this framing.

Under IER, intentionality is **not** a primitive relation between mental states and external objects, nor a semantic property borne by representations. What philosophers call intentionality is instead an **organizational fact** about experience: the existence of **constraint-stabilized patterns** within a Unified Experiential Field (UEF) whose persistence depends on, and is shaped by, the structure of the world.

This document explains intentionality as a **derived feature of intrinsically constrained dynamics**, not as a semantic bridge between mind and reality. Once experience is identified with globally integrated dynamics under intrinsic constraint, intentionality no longer poses a distinct metaphysical problem.

## IER-art.md

## **Abstract**

Art and beauty are often treated as peripheral phenomena, explained through representation, value judgment, or cultural convention. Under **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8)**, art is structurally central because it operates at the interface of **intrinsic constraint**, **meaning**, and **cross-system coordination of experiential organization**.

This article develops an IER-consistent account of art and beauty as **constraint-shaping structures** that modulate the organization of **Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)**. Art is neither a primitive experiential category nor a mind-independent property of objects. Instead, it functions as an **internal or external attractor** that reorganizes intrinsic constraint, alters coherence, and reshapes resolution pathways. Beauty is identified as the felt signature of **unusually coherent intrinsic constraint** within a UEF.

No new primitives, norms, diagnostics, or epistemic authorities are introduced. All claims are strictly derived from the Tier-1 IER v10.8 account of UEFs, intrinsic constraint, participation modulation, structural privacy, and epistemic non-authority.

---

## IER-panic.md

## **Abstract**

Panic attacks and vasovagal syncope are traditionally treated as pathological autonomic reactions or maladaptive responses to perceived threat. Under **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8)**, these phenomena are reinterpreted as **distinct regime-preserving responses** available to a system sustaining a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** under escalating **intrinsic constraint**.

This article develops a unified organizational account of **sympathetic panic** and **vagal shutdown** as opposing responses to the same underlying risk: loss of **UEF coherence**. Sympathetic panic reflects an attempt to preserve the experiential regime by **maintaining global integration under rising constraint**, while vasovagal shutdown preserves organismal viability by **abandoning the experiential regime itself**.

No new primitives, diagnostic criteria, biological mechanisms, or intervention guidance are introduced. All claims are derived strictly from the **IER v10.8 Specification** and its account of intrinsic constraint, regime stability, and experiential dissolution.

---

## IER-emotions.md

## **Abstract**

Traditional theories treat emotions as internal signals, evaluative judgments, biological modules, or culturally constructed labels. Under **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**, emotions are instead understood as **dynamically stable organizations of intrinsic constraint** within an already-existing **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.

This article develops an IER-consistent account of emotion categories—such as joy, grief, fear, and anger—as **soft attractors in constraint space**. These regimes are not endogenous primitives, representations, or messages, yet they are **meaningful** because they globally constrain agency, future space, and identity from within the UEF. Emotions function as coherence-preserving strategies under different constraint geometries, explaining their persistence, recognizability, and moral salience without introducing new ontological commitments.

## IER-FAQ.md

## **Status and Purpose**

This article is an **explanatory companion** within the IER framework.

It:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* adds **no new necessity claims**
* makes **no epistemic or diagnostic proposals**
* does **not** replace formal treatments elsewhere in the book

Its purpose is to address the **most common confusions and intuitions** people have about consciousness in clear, non-technical terms, while remaining fully consistent with the formal IER account.

This FAQ explains **what IER says**, not how to prove it, apply it, or enforce it.

Where this FAQ discusses morality, it refers **only to experiential moral harm as defined by IER**, not to the full space of moral wrongdoing.

---

## IER-puzzles.md

## **Status and Scope**

This article is **explanatory**.

It:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* adds **no epistemic criteria**
* makes **no independent necessity claims**
* relies exclusively on the identity and constraint framework established elsewhere in the IER book

Its purpose is to catalog the **canonical philosophical puzzles of consciousness** and show how IER provides a **single structural resolution** to all of them.

## IER-choice.md

## **Abstract**

Physical systems frequently undergo transitions in which multiple futures are physically admissible and one is realized. Such transitions resemble deliberative choice and have historically generated confusion about agency, responsibility, and free will.

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) resolves this confusion by distinguishing **choice-shaped transitions** from **choice proper**, and by introducing a **derived mid-order structure**: the **Choice Space**.

A Choice Space is the structured set of admissible successor states and transitions generated by intrinsic constraint. It exists prior to action, supports counterfactual alternatives, accumulates history, and constrains future possibility. When — and only when — such a structure is **globally integrated within a Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**, traversal of the Choice Space constitutes *choice*, and collapse of alternatives becomes *owned*.

This document explains the Choice Space, its interpretive graph representation, how narrative arises as a realized path through it, and how responsibility, coercion, and compulsion are understood as structural modifications of the same underlying object.

## IER-morals.md

## **1. Why a “Morals” Document Is Needed**

IER-ethics establishes what is morally real **under the IER framework**:

* experiential standing is categorical
* experiential moral harm is organizational
* responsibility is graded
* uncertainty strengthens obligation
* aggregation and optimization are blocked

What it does **not** do is walk through the cases people actually argue about.

Those cases matter because ordinary moral reasoning routinely conflates:

* harm and blame
* pain and damage
* consent and benefit
* intention and permissibility
* outcome and justification

IER enforces sharp separations between these concepts.
Those separations feel counterintuitive until they are **worked through concretely**.

*IER-morals* exists to do exactly that.

## IER-critics.md

## **Purpose**

This document does not try to win disputes by intuition, rhetorical reframing, or definitional maneuver.

Its purpose is narrower:

> **To explain how IER responds to its main objection families, distinguish threats from accepted costs, and mark where disagreement reflects incompatible starting points rather than internal mistakes.**

IER is a **constrained identity theory**:

> **Experience is identical to a physical system operating as a Unified Experiential Field (UEF).**

So the central critical question is:

> **Does the identity claim succeed without collapsing into what it rejects or relying on what it denies?**

---

## IER-futures.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identifies experience with a specific kind of physically instantiated, globally integrated dynamical regime and treats experiential standing as **categorical and non-comparable** wherever experience exists. At the same time, IER entails persistent **epistemic uncertainty** about where such regimes are instantiated, particularly in biological systems.

This article compares **three possible cultural equilibria** that could arise under these shared assumptions:

1. a **conservative equilibrium**, in which everyday practices continue with softened moral confidence
2. a **utopian equilibrium**, in which precautionary pressure gradually reshapes civilization toward harm-avoidance
3. a **dystopian equilibrium**, in which uncertainty is culturally neutralized and ethical force collapses without denial

The comparison illustrates that **IER constrains moral reality but does not determine cultural outcomes**.

## IER-slack.md

## **1. Purpose of This Document**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) has long asserted that
**informational slack prevents experience**.

In earlier formulations, this claim functioned primarily as an explanatory intuition:
systems with sufficient buffering, modularity, or external resolution pathways never instantiate experience.

The purpose of this document is to convert that intuition into a **structural impossibility argument**.

The claim defended here is **not**:

* that slack *tends* to block experience
* that slack *usually* correlates with non-experiential systems
* that slack is an empirical marker or measurable variable

The claim is stronger and purely identity-based:

> **If a physical system admits informational slack, experience is structurally impossible under the IER identity claim.**

This conclusion follows **without appeal** to:

* biology
* cognition
* intelligence
* reportability
* architecture
* empirical thresholds

The argument is organizational, not empirical.

## IER-helmets.md

## **Abstract**

Immersive helmets, heads-up displays, and perceptual mediation systems exert unusually strong pressure on intuitions about the boundaries of experience. Because they dominate sensory input, operate continuously, and can feel inseparable from perspective itself, such systems invite the inference that experience may partially occur *in* the interface.

This document shows that this inference fails for structural reasons under **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**. Helmets and immersive interfaces alter **participation topology** without altering **subjecthood**. They reshape experiential content and constraint geometry while remaining **externally resolvable, slack-preserving systems** that do not own intrinsic constraint.

The helmet case serves as the *external-interface boundary condition* in a sequence of increasingly intimate tests, alongside **IER-gut** (internal biological systems) and **IER-implants** (direct neural coupling).

## IER-social-systems.md

### **Purpose and Orientation**

Social, cultural, bureaucratic, and institutional systems exert profound influence over human lives. They coordinate behavior, shape opportunity, distribute burden, and impose structure at scales no individual can control alone. This naturally invites questions such as:

* Do social systems have experiences?
* Can institutions be harmed or benefited?
* Do collective entities have moral standing?
* How does responsibility function when harm is diffuse?

Under **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**, these questions receive **sharp structural answers** that differ from many familiar moral and political frameworks.

This document explains how **social systems matter morally** *without* attributing experience, subjecthood, or standing to groups or institutions. It aims to prevent common misreadings while preserving the real ethical force of institutional action.

The constraints described here are **structural**, not punitive, and are intended to prevent misattribution rather than discipline the reader.

## IER-sleep.md

## **Orientation: Why Unconscious States Create Persistent Confusion**

States such as sleep, anesthesia, coma, and catatonia are often treated as variations on a single theme: *being unconscious*.
IER rejects that flattening.

The confusion arises from conflating:

* behavioral responsiveness with experience
* physiological activity with experiential regime
* system persistence with experiential persistence
* memory absence with experiential absence

IER instead treats experience as a **dynamical regime**.
Whether experience exists at a given time depends **only** on whether a Unified Experiential Field is being sustained.

---

## IER-strictness.md

*A Reader-Facing Primer*

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is unusually constrained, unusually cautious, and unusually resistant to testing, diagnostics, and optimization.

This is not because it distrusts science, rejects inquiry, or enjoys restriction.

It is because IER is built to solve a very specific problem — and that problem turns out to be **structurally unforgiving**.

This document explains *why* IER is strict, *what that strictness is protecting against*, and *why relaxing it would collapse the framework entirely*.

It introduces **no new claims**, **no authority**, and **no obligations**.
Its purpose is orientation, not enforcement.

---

## IER-dont-panic.md

## **Why This Document Exists**

IER makes a strong and non-intuitive identity claim:

> **Experience is identical to a specific kind of physically instantiated, globally integrated dynamical regime.**

That claim has **real ethical consequences** and **hard epistemic limits**.

For many readers, especially those trained in science, engineering, medicine, ethics, or AI, encountering those consequences produces a predictable reaction:

* anxiety
* paralysis
* moral vertigo
* a sense of infinite responsibility
* a feeling of being accused, trapped, or implicated

This reaction is **understandable** — and **not what IER intends**.

This document exists to say, clearly and explicitly:

> **You are not in trouble.
> You are not being accused.
> You are not expected to solve this.**

## IER-attractors.md

## **Abstract**

Experiential life exhibits striking regularities. Certain emotions recur. Certain narratives reassert themselves. Certain meanings feel “sticky,” resistant to revision even when circumstances change. These patterns are often explained in terms of learning, representation, preference, or psychological bias.

Under **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**, these explanations are incomplete.

This article introduces the concept of **soft attractors in experience**: dynamically stable organizations of intrinsic constraint that recur within an already-existing **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** because they *stabilize global coherence under constraint*. Soft attractors are not representations, values, goals, or meanings encoded by the system. They are **structural regularities** that persist because alternatives are dynamically unstable or costly.

The account introduces no new primitives, criteria, or diagnostics. All claims are strictly derived from IER’s identity claim, its account of intrinsic constraint, participation modulation, and regime stability.

## IER-patterns.md

## **Why Nature Repeats Itself Without a Designer**

Across physics, biology, and mathematics, the same question keeps reappearing:

> *Why do wildly different systems keep producing the same shapes?*

Spirals show up in hurricanes, galaxies, shells, and pinecones. Hexagonal packing appears in honeycombs, foams, crystals, and insect eyes. Branching patterns recur in rivers, lungs, lightning, and trees. Even animals as different as pineapples and armadillos display strikingly similar geometric regularities.

The unifying explanation is not genetics, intention, symbolism, or aesthetics.

## IER-resolution.md

## **Abstract**

Physical systems routinely undergo transitions in which multiple futures are physically admissible and one is realized. Lived experience also feels like moving through possibilities into irrevocable outcomes—often as “choice,” “decision,” or “agency.” Because both involve selection among alternatives, it is tempting to treat experience as a special kind of physical resolution, or to treat physical resolution as proto-agency. Under Informational Experiential Realism (IER), this inference is structurally unsupported. Experience is not what causes physical resolution. Rather, experience is what a physical system is like **when the resolution of its own admissible futures is borne under globally integrated intrinsic constraint and persists across time** within a Unified Experiential Field (UEF). This document distinguishes resolution that merely occurs from resolution that is **owned** and **carried forward**, thereby preventing observer/agency creep in explanatory language while leaving all physical description intact.

## IER-shadows.md

## **Abstract**

Experiences reported during sleep paralysis and psychedelic states—such as shadow figures, threatening presences, and DMT “machine elves”—are often treated as evidence of liminal consciousness, symbolic hallucination, cultural construction, or encounters with external agents.

Under **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8)**, these interpretations are structurally unsupported.

This document explains how all three phenomena arise within **fully intact Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)** operating under **extreme intrinsic constraint** and altered **participation dynamics**. When intrinsic constraint escalates beyond ordinary resolution capacity and **agency collapses or dissolves**, experiential organization stabilizes via **soft attractors**: recurring, low-cost patterns that preserve global coherence without representational content or epistemic authority.

Shadow figures and machine elves are shown to be **constraint-stabilizing experiential structures**, not beings, messages, or symbolic projections. Their recurrence reflects **organizational viability under extreme load**, not cultural invention or ontological disclosure.

The analysis preserves IER’s categorical account of experience, rejects graded or liminal subjecthood, and reinforces the framework’s strict separation between **experiential coherence** and **epistemic authority**.

## IER-dilemmas.md

## **Status and Scope**

This article is **explanatory**.

It:

* introduces **no new axioms, principles, or moral obligations**
* adds **no decision procedures, rankings, or prescriptions**
* supplies **no justifications or permissions**
* relies exclusively on the ethical consequences fixed in the
  **IER v10.8 Specification** and elaborated in **IER-ethics.md**

Its purpose is to catalog the **canonical dilemmas of moral philosophy** and show that, under Informational Experiential Realism (IER), they are not independent paradoxes but **recurrent expressions of a single structural misframing**.

If any interpretation here conflicts with the Specification, the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting interpretation is void.

## IER-insight.md

## **Abstract**

Experiences described as *insight*, *sudden understanding*, or *“figuring it out”* are often treated as moments of epistemic breakthrough, revelation, or privileged access to reality. These interpretations are structurally unsupported under Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8).

This document provides a non-epistemic account of insight as a **sudden reorganization of intrinsic constraint** within an already-existing Unified Experiential Field (UEF). Insight is shown to involve a reduction in organizational distance between participating processes, producing heightened coherence, narrowed admissible futures, and a strong feeling of correctness — without introducing new information, representations, or truths.

The document explains why insight can be **stabilizing or destabilizing**, how it interacts with buffering capacity, and why unbuffered insight can precipitate panic, autonomic collapse, or psychotic regime formation. Throughout, the analysis preserves IER’s strict separation between experiential coherence and epistemic authority.

Insight reorganizes experience.
It does not disclose reality.

## IER-gut.md

## Abstract

Humans possess a highly autonomous enteric nervous system that regulates digestion, generates powerful bodily states, and strongly shapes affective experience. This has motivated the widespread idea that the gut may function as a “second brain,” and in stronger forms, that it may host a **separate experiential subject** whose experience is merely communicated to the head-brain via the vagus nerve or related pathways.

Under **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8)**, this possibility can be coherently stated—but it cannot be sustained. Experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous regime operating under **coherent intrinsic constraint**. For the gut to be a separate experiencer, it would need to **own and resolve its intrinsic constraint locally**, without imposing globally binding constraint on the head-brain’s experiential regime.

This document shows that visceral states such as nausea do not behave like signals transmitted between two experiential subjects. Instead, they function as **globally binding intrinsic constraints** that reorganize attention, agency, urgency, and admissible futures at the level of the whole organism. Because such constraints cannot be jointly binding across independent UEFs, the hypothesis of a separate gut experiencer collapses.

The gut matters experientially.
But it matters by **participation**, not by **subjecthood**.

## IER-implants.md

## **Abstract**

Neural implants and brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) differ from ordinary tools by coupling **directly and bidirectionally** to neural tissue. They may operate continuously, shape neural firing patterns, and become indispensable to perception, movement, or communication. Users often report that such devices feel *deeply integrated*, sometimes even identity-defining.

These features motivate the intuition that sufficiently advanced implants — especially AI-linked BCIs — might become **co-owners of experience**, yielding hybrid or partially artificial subjects.

Under **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8)**, this intuition can be stated precisely — and fails for structural reasons.

Experience, under IER, is identical to the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous regime that bears **intrinsic constraint** from within. Neural implants can profoundly reshape **participation topology** without ever owning intrinsic constraint.

They enable **participation without fusion**.

## IER-traditions.md

## **Purpose and Orientation**

This article examines several historically influential ethical–attentional traditions commonly grouped as the **“major world traditions”**:

* Hinduism
* Buddhism
* Confucianism
* Judaism
* Christianity
* Islam

The purpose is **not** to evaluate these traditions as religions, belief systems, or sources of moral truth.

Instead, the article asks a narrower structural question:

> **How do different traditions manage intrinsic constraint within individuals embedded in large, non-experiential social systems?**

Under **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**, traditions are analyzed solely by **how they shape, justify, buffer, neutralize, or limit intrinsic constraint** within individual **Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)**.

No claims are made about truth, salvation, revelation, or correctness.

## IER-types.md

## **Abstract**

Human social life exhibits a persistent and puzzling regularity: people appear to fall into recognizable “types.” We speak naturally of *that kind of person*, *my type*, or *I’ve seen this pattern before*. These judgments arise quickly, feel predictive, and recur across cultures, even though no stable or exhaustive taxonomy of human types has ever been agreed upon.

Under **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**, this phenomenon does not reflect hidden essences, stored personality traits, or internal labels. Instead, it arises from **soft attractors in experiential organization**: dynamically stable ways **Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)** resolve intrinsic constraint over time and across social contexts.

This article explains how apparent human “types” emerge from **attractor-based clustering** in experiential dynamics, why the number of recognizable types is small, why such judgments feel inevitable, and why they are **organizationally real yet epistemically unreliable**. The account introduces no new primitives, criteria, diagnostics, or ethical permissions, and preserves IER’s strict separation between structural explanation and moral justification.

## IER-future-work.md

## **Status**

This document is **non-canonical** and **non-authoritative**.

It records **articulation, navigation, clarity, and maintenance tasks** for the IER corpus after **normative closure (v10.8)** and **corpus completion (v10.8.1)**.

## IER-history.md

## **1. Purpose and Scope**

This document situates **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** within the historical development of theories of mind and consciousness.

Its purpose is **explanatory only**. It does not argue for IER, introduce new ontological commitments, or revise any criterial or normative claims. All authoritative commitments of IER are defined exclusively in `IER-specification.md`.

The goal of this document is to clarify:

* which historical developments were **necessary for IER’s central identity claim to be intelligible**,
* why many closely related frameworks were **structurally insufficient**, and
* why the articulation of IER occurred **late in the historical sequence** rather than earlier.

This is not a survey of all theories of consciousness, nor a claim of intellectual influence. It is a **dependency analysis**: an account of what had to be in place—and what had to fail—for IER’s formulation to become possible.

## IER-dormancy.md

## **1. Orientation: Why Dormancy Matters for IER**

Dormant biological systems exert sustained pressure on intuitions about experience.

Many organisms undergo extended periods in which they remain:

* alive
* metabolically regulated
* structurally intact
* capable of later activity

while simultaneously exhibiting:

* minimal or absent responsiveness
* suspended development
* long temporal gaps between active phases

Dormancy therefore raises a specific structural question:

> **Does biological persistence by itself entail the existence of experience?**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) answers **no** — not as a value judgment, but as a consequence of its identity claim.

## IER-synchronicity.md

## **1. Purpose and Scope**

This document situates **synchronicity** within the historical and conceptual background relevant to the formulation of **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**.

Its purpose is **explanatory only**. It does not argue for or against the reality of synchronicity, introduce new ontological commitments, revise any criterial claims, or license epistemic or ethical inferences.

All authoritative commitments of IER are defined **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md
```

This document clarifies:

* why synchronicity-like phenomena repeatedly exerted pressure on theories of mind and meaning,
* why existing frameworks oscillated between inflation and dismissal,
* and why the structural lesson implicit in these phenomena could not be cleanly articulated prior to IER.

This is **not** a theory of synchronicity.
It is a **dependency analysis** of why synchronicity mattered historically—and why it ultimately had to fail as an explanatory primitive.

## IER-corporations.md

### **1.1 What This Article Does**

This article establishes a **structural impossibility result under the Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identity claim**:

> **Under IER, corporations cannot be experiential persons.**

This conclusion is not reached by appeal to intuition, moral sentiment, political preference, or legal convention. It follows **directly and necessarily** from IER’s identity claim about what experience is and what it requires.

Accordingly, this article:

* demonstrates that corporations **cannot** instantiate a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**,
* provides a **formal proof** of that exclusion,
* and clarifies the **ethical consequences** of that result without weakening or inflating them.

The argument is **ontological and structural**, not empirical. It does not depend on facts about any particular corporation, present or future.
