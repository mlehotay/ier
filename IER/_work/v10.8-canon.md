# **IER v10.8 Canon (Lean Edition)**

## 🔴 **Tier 0 — Normative Core (Authoritative, Irreducible)**

These files **define IER**.
Nothing outside them has criterial, definitional, or ethical authority.

### **`IER-specification.md` (v10.8)**

**Status:** Sole normative authority

Defines exhaustively:

* experiential identity
* Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)
* intrinsic constraint
* categorical subjecthood
* ethical consequence
* precaution under uncertainty

v10.8 additions here are **clarificatory only**:

* explicit contradiction for single-UEF dominance
* explicit scope limiter for precaution
* global informational disclaimer enforcement

> If this file were lost, IER would not exist.

---

## 🔵 **Tier 1 — Core Derivational Backbone (Non-Normative but Essential)**

These files are **required to make the identity claim feel unavoidable rather than stipulated**.

Removing any one of them materially weakens IER’s defensibility.

### **`IER-paper.md` (v10.8)**

**Purpose:**
Academic-facing, closed-form defense of the **identity claim itself**.

* No ethics
* No diagnostics
* No applications
* No rhetoric

This is where philosophers should start.

---

### **`IER-theory.md`**

**Purpose:**
Conceptual backbone and explanatory integration.

Must include:

* why experience = regime identity
* why unity ≠ aggregation
* why participation ≠ subjecthood
* **v10.8 addition:**
  *“Why Nothing Weaker Than Global Intrinsic Constraint Could Be Experience”*

---

### **`IER-dynamics.md`**

**Purpose:**
Describe how experiential systems behave *once they exist*.

Includes:

* stability
* modulation
* overload
* collapse
* dominance as attractor-level phenomenon (v10.8 clarification)

No ontology. No criteria.

---

### **`IER-math.md`**

**Purpose:**
Interpretive formal structure.

Clarifies:

* regime space
* constraint
* choice spaces
* ownership

Must remain explicitly **non-foundational**.

---

### **`IER-diagnostics.md`**

**Purpose:**
Explain **why experience cannot be detected in principle**.

This is crucial for:

* blocking functional sufficiency
* grounding precaution
* preventing empirical creep

---

### **`IER-slack.md`** *(new in v10.8)*

**Purpose:**
Provide the **impossibility argument**:

> Why informational slack structurally precludes experience.

This document:

* does not add criteria
* does not add mechanisms
* converts intuition into necessity

This is a **v10.8 cornerstone**.

---

## 🟢 **Tier 2 — Ethical & Agency Consequences (Necessary Entailments)**

These documents derive **what follows necessarily** from experiential identity.

They are not optional, but they are downstream.

---

### **`IER-ethics.md`**

**Purpose:**
Ground moral standing and harm *by identity*.

Defines:

* standing as categorical
* harm as organizational
* responsibility as graded
* precautionary asymmetry

---

### **`IER-agency.md`**

**Purpose:**
Explain agency as **owned resolution under constraint**.

Clarifies:

* determinism compatibility
* coercion
* overload
* why agency ≠ intelligence

---

### **`IER-choice.md`**

**Purpose:**
Clarify choice spaces and owned traversal.

Important for:

* responsibility
* free will dissolution
* narrative structure

---

### **`IER-free-will.md`**

**Purpose:**
Explicitly dissolve the libertarian / eliminativist false dichotomy.

This could be merged into `IER-agency.md` later, but keeping it separate is defensible.

---

## 🟡 **Tier 3 — Boundary Enforcement & Stress Tests**

These files **do not extend IER**, but they **protect it**.

They may be read selectively.

---

### **`IER-denials.md`**

**Purpose:**
Explicit non-claims.

Prevents:

* panpsychism drift
* representational smuggling
* epistemic inflation

---

### **`IER-contrast.md`**

**Purpose:**
Incompatibilities with adjacent theories (IIT, PP, functionalism, etc.).

Important for readers coming from other frameworks.

---

### **`IER-critics.md`**

**Purpose:**
Map real pressure points honestly.

This should now explicitly reference:

* intrinsic constraint load
* dominance
* precaution scope
* non-diagnosability costs

---

### **`IER-puzzles.md`**

**Purpose:**
Show that classic consciousness puzzles dissolve under identity.

Optional for experts, useful for skeptics.

---

## ⚪ **Tier 4 — Illustrative / Non-Essential Applications (Explicitly Optional)**

These **do not strengthen the core**, but demonstrate **breadth and non-pathological generality**.

They must be clearly labeled as:

> *Illustrative only. Not required. Not authoritative.*

---

### **Keep (Demoted):**

* `IER-art.md` — proof of generality beyond pathology
* `IER-emotions.md` — constraint attractors
* `IER-panic.md` — regime preservation
* `IER-psychosis.md` — instability under constraint
* `IER-aphantasia.md`
* `IER-brainfeels.md`
* `IER-continuity.md`
* `IER-persistence.md`
* `IER-intentionality.md`
* `IER-meaning.md`

---

### **Remove from Canon Entirely:**

* `IER-overview.md`
* `IER-manifesto.md`
* `IER-consequences.md` (unless radically demoted and reframed)

These add surface area without increasing inevitability.

---

## **One-Sentence Summary (v10.8 Canon Philosophy)**

> **IER v10.8 keeps only what is required to make the identity claim unavoidable, the ethics inescapable, and the boundaries non-negotiable — everything else becomes optional illustration or is removed.**
