## 1. Concrete plan: v10.8 → v10.8.1

### Step 0 — Declare intent (mentally + in changelog)

Treat **v10.8.1** as a **completion + clarification patch**, not a conceptual extension.

Scope allowed:

* glossary
* index
* clarity edits
* limit-tightening language
* reader containment
* corpus completeness

No new commitments.

---

### Step 1 — Add structural completeness docs

Create and add:

* `IER-glossary.md`
* `IER-index.md`

Rules:

* purely definitional / navigational
* no new claims
* glossary terms must already be grounded in Tier-1 docs
* index entries point *into* canon, never summarize or reinterpret

Commit these together if possible.

---

### Step 2 — Make *final* clarity edits to the v10.8 spec

Allowed spec edits for **10.8.1**:

* tighten scope language
* sharpen impossibility claims already implied
* remove ambiguity that could enable misreadings
* clarify limits, exclusions, or “does not imply” statements

Disallowed:

* adding new constraints
* changing ethical conclusions
* introducing new primitives
* reopening diagnostics, measures, or detection

Treat this as **sealing**, not revising.

---

### Step 3 — Tag the release

After the glossary, index, and spec edits are in:

```bash
git tag -a v10.8.1 -m "IER v10.8.1 — corpus completion and clarity pass"
git push origin v10.8.1
```

This becomes:

* the **complete reference corpus**
* the baseline for all future explanation and application work

---

### Step 4 — Resume normal patch-level iteration

After v10.8.1:

* continue revising language freely
* improve pedagogy
* reorder docs
* add examples, comparisons, and applications

All of this stays **10.8.x** unless Tier-1 commitments change.

---

## 2. Paste-ready process for `IER-canon.md`

Here is a **compact, general process section** you can drop in.

---

## **Release and Maintenance Process**

IER distinguishes between **normative closure**, **corpus completeness**, and **ongoing maintenance**.

### **Normative Closure**

A version may be declared normatively closed when:

* identity claims are fixed
* ethical consequences are fixed
* epistemic limits are fixed

After closure, no new authoritative commitments may be introduced.

---

### **Corpus Completion**

A patch release may be designated as a **completion release**, marking:

* a full and stable document set
* finalized indices, glossaries, and navigation
* sealed clarification of scope and limits

Completion releases do not reopen normative commitments.

---

### **Maintenance**

After completion:

* clarification, pedagogy, tone, structure, and examples may continue to evolve
* documents may be reorganized or refined
* no change may add, remove, or weaken Tier-1 commitments

Such work proceeds under patch versions.

---

### **Tier Discipline**

* Changes to **Tier-1 documents** require a **minor or major** version bump.
* Changes to lower tiers may remain within patch versions.
* If a change would require altering Tier-1 commitments to justify itself, it is out of scope by definition.

---

### **Current State**

**IER v10.8 is normatively closed.**
**IER v10.8.1 marks corpus completion.**
