### 🔖 What Are Brainfeels?  
**Brainfeels** are internal experiences that feel sensory—like smells, textures, moods, or tastes—but aren’t directly tied to external stimuli. They often arise from a complex blend of:
- **Neurotransmitter shifts** (e.g. meds like Vyvanse, Effexor, Prozac)
- **Gut-brain signals** (e.g. digestive states like diarrhea or cravings)
- **Emotional memory** (e.g. grief, nostalgia, personal history)

They’re part perception, part metaphor, part haunting—your nervous system’s way of saying *“Something's happening in here.”*

## 🧭 The Brainfeel Model: Three-Layer Interaction

| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| 🧠 **Neurotransmitter Balance** | Medication effects, chemical mood shifts, attention/focus regulation |
| 🦠 **Gut-Brain Signaling** | Digestive states, cravings, nausea, tension in the viscera |
| 💭 **Emotional Memory** | Grief, desire, nostalgia, identity, psychological echoes |

Brainfeels arise when these systems **collide, layer, or try to interpret each other**.

## 🎙 Ice Cream Sandwich Brainfeel  
**Poetic Reflection**

I wanna take you home  
not in the way they mean it—  
more like  
borrow your skin  
stand in your mirror  
wear your sadness just right  
like a thrifted coat with pockets full of old love notes  
and broken guitar picks  
  
I wanna try on your clothes  
and maybe your childhood  
and maybe the way you laugh when you lie  
and maybe the silence you leave in the room after you’ve gone  
  
This feels like a Savannah Brown poem  
read under the dim halo of a dorm lamp  
while vinyl spins  
a woman’s voice half-whispering  
about desire and disaster  
while you sit on the floor, knees touching  
not sure if you want to kiss her  
or cry into her shirt  
  
The world feels analog right now  
slow-dragged  
like you could fall into the spaces between the lines  
and no one would notice  
except her  
except the ghost of the song

*(Generated in response to your ice cream sandwich brainfeel prompt—reflecting the emotional tone you described.)*
