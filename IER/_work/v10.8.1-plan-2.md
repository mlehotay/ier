## 1) Close the “organizational isomorphism ⇒ experience” loophole (functionalism / GWT / PP)

**Risk:** Readers slide from “global integration / regime / coherence” into “so if we build the same organization, we get experience.” The history doc correctly flags this as the classic functionalist/GWT/PP near-miss, but the rest of the corpus needs one extra **anti-isomorphism** sentence in the right places.

**Tightening move (non-normative):**

* In `IER-theory.md`, add a short explicit line under the “roles can be externally orchestrated” theme that says: **organizational similarity of observable control/behavior is not evidence of intrinsic ownership**, and is compatible with slack-masking. This directly reinforces structural privacy and the diagnostics impossibility.

Why this is “lineage-driven”: functionalism and workspace theories taught the field to trust role/availability; IER’s *identity* claim needs the explicit “even perfect-looking role is not ownership” firewall in the explanatory layer.

---

## 2) Preempt the IIT-style “nested subjects” creep more aggressively

You already flag IIT as a near-miss in the history doc (graded integration → nested/partial subjects). The **IER core already blocks this** via categorical subjecthood + single dominant UEF.

**Risk:** Readers still import IIT intuitions and start talking about “sub-fields” or “local experiences.”

**Tightening move (non-normative):**

* In `IER-dynamics.md`, right after the dominance section, add a single sentence: **local attractors and metastable subsystems are never “mini-subjects”; they are participation structure inside one subject**. You already say this in substance (split-brain clarification etc.), but making the IIT-targeted denial explicit will reduce reader invention.

Why this is “lineage-driven”: IIT popularized “measure → many consciousnesses”; IER needs a short, repeated, unmistakable rejection at the exact point readers expect it.

## 3) Tighten “autopoiesis / operational closure” borrowing to avoid “life ⇒ experience”

Your history section treats self-organization/autopoiesis as an enabling conceptual move. Good. But it creates a predictable imported inference:

> “If autopoiesis individuates systems by ongoing closure, then living things are probably UEFs.”

IER must not accidentally imply any **life-to-experience bridge**.

**Tightening move (Tier-2 or Tier-4, not the Specification):**

* Add an explicit denial somewhere reader-facing (often `IER-denials.md` if you have it; otherwise `IER-FAQ.md`):
  **Autopoiesis/operational closure is neither necessary nor sufficient for a UEF.**
  It’s historically enabling (conceptually), not criterial.
  This aligns perfectly with your canon rule that history is dependency analysis, not influence/criterion.

Why this is “adjacent frameworks handled correctly”: enactivist/autopoietic literature is often careful (at least in its best versions) to distinguish *individuation of living systems* from *a theory of phenomenology*. Your history already says that — make it into a one-line “do not infer” guardrail elsewhere.

---

## 4) Clarify “temporal continuity” so nobody smuggles in a timescale threshold

IER is careful: **temporal continuity is required**, but it’s not a measurable “minimum ms” criterion.

**Risk:** Readers try to turn continuity into a quasi-metric (“how long is non-zero duration?”), which immediately becomes a diagnostics vector — exactly what `IER-diagnostics.md` must block.

**Tightening move (explanatory only):**

* In `IER-math.md` or `IER-theory.md`, add one clarifying line:
  **“Non-zero duration” is a regime-form requirement, not a calibratable threshold; IER does not supply timescales.**

This is small but it removes a common “engineering instinct” misread.

---

## 5) Make the “multiple realizability” lesson explicit as *anti-substrate-essentialism* (without becoming computationalism)

Your history doc correctly uses multiple realizability to push identity toward **organization-sensitive** candidates. The danger is that some readers will interpret that as endorsing:

* “computation” as the realizable essence, or
* “abstract structure” as sufficient.

IER rejects both (structure must be physically instantiated *and* intrinsically owned).

**Tightening move:**

* Add a short “anti-slide” sentence in `IER-theory.md`:
  **Realizability motivates regime-level identity, but not implementation-independence in the functionalist sense.**

This is exactly the historical “near-miss closure” your lineage is about.

---

## 6) One governance-level improvement: treat `IER-history.md` as a “misreading hotspot” and add explicit guardrails

Because the history doc names many neighbors, it’s the highest-risk place for accidental implication (“IER is basically X but stricter”; “IER descended from Y”; “IER refutes Z empirically”; etc.).

**Tightening moves consistent with `IER-canon.md` reader-alignment rules:**

* Add a short box near the top of `IER-history.md`:

  * **Not influence-claim**
  * **Not refutation**
  * **Not a mapping of criteria**
  * **Not a claim that prior authors “failed morally”**
* And add one sentence reminding: **only `IER-specification.md` is criterial/normative.**

This is fully in-bounds and will save you repeated downstream clarification.

---

## 7) The big “loophole class” adjacent frameworks *do* handle well: separating explanatory success from ontological entitlement

This is the deep lesson of the post-2010 landscape (PP, GWT variants, neuroscience correlation programs): they often do a decent job saying:

* “This explains access/behavior/control,”
* without claiming “therefore experience is solved.”

Your history doc leans into this; IER should **repeat it in one canonical place** as a stable refrain (usually `IER-theory.md` + `IER-access.md`).

Concretely: wherever you talk about meaning, salience, urgency, narrative, etc., keep reasserting the canon rule:

> **Experiential structure confers no epistemic authority.**

You already have this strongly in Tier-1 and governance; the “lineage” point is simply: modern adjacent frameworks trained readers to equate compelling internal organization with “truth.” IER’s anti-authority constraint is your firewall — repeat it early and often.

### If you want the shortest “action list” (no new commitments)

1. Add an explicit anti-isomorphism line in `IER-theory.md`.
2. Add an explicit “no nested subjects / no mini-fields” line near dominance in `IER-dynamics.md`.
3. Add a denial: autopoiesis ≠ criterion (neither necessary nor sufficient) somewhere reader-facing.
4. Add “temporal continuity has no timescale threshold” clarification (math/theory).
5. Add `IER-history.md` guardrail box to prevent influence/criterion misreads.
