# **IER — Future Work and Articulation Notes**

## **Status**

This document is **non-canonical** and **non-authoritative**.

It records **articulation, navigation, clarity, and maintenance tasks** for the IER corpus after **normative closure (v10.8)** and **corpus completion (v10.8.1)**.

It introduces **no ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical claims**
and does **not** signal intended changes to the IER framework.

---

## **Purpose**

`IER-future-work.md` exists to track:

* clarity improvements
* reader-alignment hardening
* navigation and indexing tasks
* misuse-containment checks
* consistency audits

It is **not** a roadmap for new theory development.

---

## **Navigation & Orientation**

* [x] `IER-glossary.md`
  Canon-constrained definitions of recurring terms; explicit rejection of folk and adjacent-theory meanings.

* [x] `IER-index.md`
  Navigational index mapping concepts → documents → sections; no summaries or reinterpretation.

* [ ] Cross-link glossary terms to first canonical usage.

* [ ] Audit README reading paths for redundancy and dead ends.

---

## **Articulation & Clarity Passes**

* [ ] Tighten scope and limit language in Tier-1 documents where misreadings recur.
* [ ] Remove ambiguous metaphors that invite representational or functional interpretations.
* [ ] Standardize terminology across Tier-2 documents (e.g. regime, participation, dominance).
* [ ] Add explicit “does not imply” blocks where readers routinely over-infer.

---

## **Misuse & Misreading Containment**

* [ ] Scan for reintroduction of diagnostic or threshold language.
* [ ] Ensure all informational language includes required disclaimers.
* [ ] Block graded-subjecthood implications in phenomenology-adjacent docs.
* [ ] Reinforce non-epistemic authority language in meaning, agency, and insight documents.

---

## **Consistency & Drift Audits**

* [ ] Periodic comparison of Tier-2 documents against current Tier-1 wording.
* [ ] Ethics language audit for alignment with v10.8 normative closure.
* [ ] Reader-alignment tone audit (no adversarial framing).
* [ ] Verify that non-canonical documents are clearly labeled as such.

---

## **Tooling / Meta (Optional)**

* [ ] Machine-readable index or manifest for tooling.
* [ ] Simple linting rules for forbidden phrases (agentive language in definitions, etc.).
* [ ] Automated checks for missing disclaimers.

---

## **Non-Goals**

This document does **not** track:

* new theoretical directions
* speculative extensions
* unresolved foundational questions
* potential ontology revisions

Any work of that kind would require a **new version and explicit canon revision**.
