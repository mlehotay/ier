# **IER — Future Work and Articulation Ledger**

## **Status**

This document is **non-canonical** and **non-authoritative**.

It records the **entire remaining space of permissible future work** on the Informational Experiential Realism (IER) corpus **after**:

* **normative closure (v10.8)**, and
* **corpus completion and misuse hardening (v10.8.1)**.

It introduces **no ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical claims**,
and it signals **no pending revisions** to the IER framework.

All binding commitments remain fixed **exclusively** in:

* `IER-specification.md`, and
* governed by `IER-canon.md`.

If an activity is **not listed here**, it is **out of scope by default**.

---

## **Purpose**

`IER-future-work.md` defines, exhaustively, **what kinds of work may still occur** within the IER project **without reopening the theory**.

Permitted work is limited to:

* articulation tightening
* reader-alignment hardening
* navigation and orientation improvements
* misuse- and misreading-containment
* internal consistency and drift audits
* optional explanatory packaging already identified during v10.8.1

This document is **not**:

* a roadmap for new theory
* a list of open philosophical problems
* a staging ground for extensions
* a venue for speculative interpretation
* a placeholder for “future ideas”

Completion of the items below **does not alter** IER’s ontology, identity conditions, ethical consequences, or epistemic limits.

---

## **I. Navigation & Orientation Tasks**

These tasks improve **access, entry, and usability only**.

They do not add explanation, interpretation, or emphasis.

### **Completed**

* [x] `IER-glossary.md`
  Canon-constrained definitions; blocks imported meanings.

* [x] `IER-index.md`
  Concept-to-location navigation only; no summaries or reinterpretation.

### **Remaining**

* [ ] **Cross-link glossary entries to first canonical usage**

  * Each term links to its first authoritative introduction.
  * No added exposition or paraphrase permitted.

* [ ] **Audit README reading paths**

  * Remove redundancy, loops, or dead ends.
  * Ensure all suggested paths terminate in closed Tier-1 material.

* [ ] **Add minimal “where to go next” pointers**

  * Target audiences: philosophy, neuroscience, ethics, AI.
  * Descriptive only; no endorsement or interpretive steering.

---

## **II. Mandatory Articulation Tightening (Non-Normative)**

These are **explicit closure tasks**, not optional improvements.

They eliminate predictable misreadings without adding commitments.

* [ ] **Anti-isomorphism clarification** (`IER-theory.md`)

  > Organizational, functional, or behavioral similarity does not imply intrinsic ownership of constraint or experience, and remains compatible with slack-masked non-experience.

* [ ] **No nested subjects / no mini-fields statement** (`IER-dynamics.md`)

  > Local attractors, metastable subsystems, or participation clusters are never subjects or sub-fields; they are internal participation structure within a single Unified Experiential Field.

* [ ] **Temporal continuity ≠ timescale threshold clarification**
  (`IER-theory.md` or `IER-math.md`)

  > “Non-zero duration” is a regime-formal requirement, not a measurable or calibratable temporal threshold.

* [ ] **Autopoiesis / operational closure denial**
  (`IER-denials.md` or `IER-FAQ.md`)

  > Autopoiesis and operational closure are neither necessary nor sufficient for a Unified Experiential Field; their role in IER is historical and explanatory only.

* [ ] **Multiple realizability ≠ implementation independence clarification**
  (`IER-theory.md`)

  > Regime-level identity allows multiple realization without implying functional, computational, or implementation independence.

* [ ] **Metaphor audit (global)**

  * Remove or neutralize metaphors that invite:

    * representational readings
    * functional sufficiency intuitions
    * epistemic authority creep

**Stopping condition:**
Each clarification appears **exactly once**, as an **explicit non-inference**, in an appropriate Tier-1 or Tier-2 document.

---

## **III. Misuse & Misreading Containment (Mandatory)**

These tasks preserve **long-term stability** of interpretation.

* [ ] **Scan Tier-2 documents for diagnostic or proxy language**

  * Eliminate phrasing that could be read as:

    * thresholds
    * indicators
    * sufficient conditions
    * measurable correlates

* [ ] **Verify informational-language disclaimers**

  * Every document using informational terms must include the required disclaimer.

* [ ] **Audit phenomenology-adjacent documents**

  * Ensure no implication of graded subjecthood, partial experience, or liminal standing.

* [ ] **Reinforce “experiential structure ≠ epistemic authority”**

  * Required in meaning-, insight-, agency-, narrative-, and belief-adjacent texts.

---

## **IV. History & Lineage Guardrails (Mandatory)**

These tasks prevent retrospective misinterpretation.

* [ ] **Add a guardrail box to `IER-history.md`** clarifying:

  * not a claim of influence
  * not a refutation project
  * not a criterial mapping
  * not a moral evaluation of predecessors

* [ ] **Reaffirm explicitly** that:

  * only `IER-specification.md` is normative and criterial

No new historical analysis is permitted or required.

---

## **V. Optional Standalone Explanatory Articles (Non-Required)**

These are **audience-management tools only**.

They introduce no theory and are not required for closure.

* [ ] **`IER-regimes.md`**

  * Regime vs. description
  * Why regime talk does not imply modeling-level equivalence

* [ ] **`IER-and-engineering.md`**

  * What IER does *not* license in AI or systems engineering
  * Why “build-and-test” intuitions fail structurally

Failure to complete these documents does **not** indicate unfinished theory.

---

## **VI. Consistency & Drift Audits (Ongoing, Non-Blocking)**

Maintenance only.

* [ ] Tier-1 / Tier-2 language consistency checks
* [ ] Ethics language audit against v10.8 closure
* [ ] Reader-alignment tone audit
* [ ] Verification that non-canonical documents are not cited as authority

---

## **VII. Tier Assignment Corrections (Mandatory, Structural Only)**

These changes correct **labeling**, not authority.

### **A) `IER-math.md`**

* Reclassify from **[T1] → [T2]**

### **B) `IER-ethics.md`**

* Reclassify from **[T1] → [T2]**

Document placement is stylistic; tier labeling is binding.

---

## **VIII. Tooling / Meta (Optional)**

Convenience only.

* [ ] Machine-readable manifest or index
* [ ] Lightweight linting rules for:

  * agentive language in definitions
  * missing informational disclaimers
  * forbidden diagnostic phrasing
* [ ] Automated tier-violation checks

---

## **Non-Goals (Binding)**

This document explicitly excludes:

* new theory
* speculative extensions
* unresolved foundational questions
* revisions to ontology, identity, or ethics

Any such change would require:

* a new version number, and
* explicit canon revision.

---

## **Closure Condition**

When Sections **II, III, IV, and VII** are complete:

> **IER v10.8.1 is articulation-complete under its own canon rules.**

All remaining activity is **maintenance or optional pedagogy**,
not unfinished theory.
