# **IER — Future Work and Articulation Notes**

**Status:**
This document is **non-canonical, non-normative, and non-binding**.

It records **possible future writing domains** identified *after the normative closure of Informational Experiential Realism (IER) v10.8*.

This document:

* does **not** propose changes to IER v10.8
* does **not** commit the project to a future version
* does **not** introduce ontology, criteria, ethics, diagnostics, or exclusions
* does **not** imply that further theory development is planned or required

Its sole purpose is to clarify **what kinds of work would still be legitimate** under a closed theory, and which kinds of work would *require* a genuine version change.

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority remains exclusively with:

```
IER/IER-specification.md   (v10.8)
```

---

## 1. Context: Closure and Versioning

IER v10.8 is **normatively closed**.

This means:

* the identity claim is fixed
* criteria and diagnostics are ruled out in principle
* ethical scope and asymmetries are fixed
* structural impossibility arguments are complete
* canon tiering and misuse constraints are settled

Accordingly:

* **minor versions (v10.x)** would only be appropriate for:

  * typo correction
  * editorial cleanup
  * clarification of wording
  * reorganization without new claims
* **a major version (v11.0)** would be justified *only* by:

  * new identity conditions
  * new structural impossibility arguments
  * revised ethical scope
  * changes to canon authority or tiering

This document exists **outside that numbering scheme** to avoid implying that either kind of change is anticipated.

---

## 2. What This Document Is (and Is Not)

This document is:

* a **thinking aid**
* a **scope guardrail**
* a record of questions people will predictably ask
* a filter against accidental theory creep

This document is **not**:

* a roadmap
* a commitment
* a to-do list
* a promise of future releases
* a plan for IER v11

Silence remains the default.

Writing is justified only where silence would predictably cause misuse, misinterpretation, or ethical drift.

---

## 3. Canon-Safe Articulation Domains (Low Risk)

These domains **apply or clarify existing commitments** without revising ontology, criteria, or ethics.

They are safe precisely because they *reduce* misunderstanding.

### 3.1 Sleep, Dreaming, and Unconscious Intervals

**Possible document:** `IER-sleep-and-dreaming.md`

Focus:

* sleep, anesthesia, and dream states
* partial participation vs regime absence
* dream content without subject multiplication
* continuity across unconscious intervals

No diagnostics.
No thresholds.
No neuroscientific anchoring.

---

### 3.2 Social Systems Without Collective Experience

**Possible document:** `IER-social-systems.md`

Focus:

* coordination without shared UEFs
* denial of group or institutional subjecthood
* amplification of intrinsic constraint across individuals
* avoiding “hive mind” misreadings

Primarily misuse-preventive.

---

### 3.3 Institutional and Policy Harm

**Possible document:** `IER-institutional-harm.md`

Focus:

* institutions as external constraint imposers
* bureaucratic, algorithmic, and structural harm
* responsibility diffusion
* harm without collective standing

Applies existing ethical commitments only.

---

### 3.4 Glossary and Terminology Discipline

**Possible document:** `IER-glossary.md`

Focus:

* canonical meanings of recurring terms
* explicit rejection of folk or adjacent-theory meanings
* reducing reader-invented reinterpretations

Purely explanatory.
Tier-4 only.

---

## 4. Domains That Would Require a Version Change

The following are **not planned** and are listed only to mark boundaries.

Engaging them would likely require **IER v11.0 or later**, not an extension of v10.8.

Examples:

* experiential capacity conditions
* ontogenesis of UEF-enabling structure
* training or optimization under irreversible commitment
* new structural impossibility proofs
* revisions to precaution scope
* changes to canon authority or tier definitions

If any of these became necessary, this document would no longer apply.

---

## 5. Governing Test for Any Future Writing

Before writing any new document, the following question must be answered **affirmatively**:

> *Does this clarify consequences of the existing identity claim without introducing new criteria, thresholds, diagnostics, epistemic authority, or ethical scope?*

If not, the document should not be written under IER v10.8.

---

## 6. Closing Note

IER is complete as a theory.

Future writing, if any, exists only to:

* prevent misinterpretation
* block predictable misuse
* clarify consequences people will ask about anyway

No further development is required for coherence.

Silence remains the default.
