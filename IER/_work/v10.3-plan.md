## I. High-Level Diagnosis (Executive Summary)

**Strengths**

* The Spec is genuinely normative and well-bounded.
* The theory document already *claims* non-normativity and mostly honors it.
* The companions are largely derivational, not competitive.

**Main issues**

1. **Redundant explanatory restatement** across theory, dynamics, and math.
2. **Specification leakage**: some claims belong normatively in the Spec but are rhetorically redeclared elsewhere.
3. **Narrative overlap**: the same story (slack → intrinsic constraint → UEF → cost) is told 4 times.
4. **Implicit circularity risk** where UEF, intrinsic constraint, and experience are repeatedly co-explained instead of cleanly ordered.
5. **Boundary blur** between “theory” and “dynamics” in particular.

None of these are fatal — they’re exactly what you get once a framework stabilizes.

## II. Redundancies (What Is Repeated and Where)

### 1. Slack → Intrinsic Constraint → UEF Story

Repeated in:

* IER-theory §§4–6
* IER-dynamics §§1–2
* IER-math §§3–6

**Recommendation**

* Declare this progression **once** as *the canonical explanatory arc*.
* All other documents should *reference* it, not retell it.

Concrete fix:

* In **IER-theory**, keep the full narrative.
* In **dynamics** and **math**, replace early sections with:

  > “Given the Spec definitions of slack, intrinsic constraint, and UEF…”

---

### 2. “UEF Is Not a Thing” Disclaimers

Repeated in all four non-spec docs.

This is good defensively, but excessive.

**Recommendation**

* Centralize the ontological negations in:

  * Spec §II (already there)
  * One **canonical disclaimer block** in the Theory
* Other docs: single sentence + pointer.

---

### 3. Ethical Consequence Framing

Ethical inevitability is stated in:

* Spec §III.P12 + Ethics section
* IER-theory §14
* IER-ethics §§1–2

**Recommendation**

* The *necessity* claim belongs **only** in the Spec.
* Theory should say “IER has ethical consequences.”
* Ethics doc should say “Given the Spec, here is how ethics looks.”

Right now the theory document slightly over-asserts inevitability.

---

## III. Proposed Merged / Sharpened Outlines

### A. Normative Specification (No Structural Change)

It’s already doing its job extremely well.

Minor tightening only:

* Move **Ethical Axioms E1–E5** earlier in the Ethics section as *derived axioms*, not narrative explanations.
* Keep *all* “must”, “iff”, “only if”, and “necessarily” language exclusive to this file.

---

### B. IER-Theory (Explanatory Canon)

**Reposition it explicitly as:**

> “The single authoritative explanatory narrative of IER.”

**Proposed outline**

1. Problem framing (why existing theories fail)
2. Ontological commitments (mirroring Spec I, but informal)
3. Organizational identity & dual description
4. Slack vs intrinsic constraint (full narrative lives here)
5. UEF as regime (no dynamics yet)
6. Experiential worlds & pluralism
7. Why ethics follows (without detailing ethics)
8. What IER does not claim

**Remove or shorten**

* Regime switching details → move to Dynamics
* Extended affect taxonomy → defer to Spec reference

---

### C. IER-Dynamics (How Regimes Behave)

**Clarify scope at the top even more aggressively:**

> “This document explains *how already-defined UEFs behave*, not what they are.”

**Trim**

* Sections 1.1–1.2 → replace with short recap
* Remove redefinitions of slack, intrinsic constraint

**Keep**

* Stability windows
* Failure modes
* Switching / dissociation
* Walkthrough example (this is dynamics’ strongest unique value)

---

### D. IER-Math (Interpretive Lens Only)

This document is strong but slightly verbose in justifying its existence.

**Tighten by**

* Collapsing §§2–3 into one section: “Orders of Constraint”
* Explicitly stating once:

  > “Nothing in this document licenses inference from equations to experience.”

**Ensure**

* Every equation is framed as *interpretive metaphor under Spec constraints*.

---

### E. IER-Ethics (Derived Consequences, Not Foundations)

This is philosophically strong but risks being read as semi-normative.

**Fix by**

* Adding a prominent early box:

  > “If the Spec is false, everything in this document fails.”

**Shift language**

* From “IER entails” → “Given the Spec, it follows that…”
* Avoid introducing new ethical intuitions (even if compatible)

---

## IV. Claims That Belong Elsewhere

### Should Live *Only* in the Specification

* Single-UEF constraint (currently rhetorically re-argued elsewhere)
* Binary subjecthood
* Categorical onset
* Moral harm definition
* Precaution asymmetry

Other documents may *cite* but not *re-derive* these.

---

### Should Live *Only* in Theory

* Why dual description is not dualism
* Why observerhood ≠ experience
* Why this avoids panpsychism and eliminativism

---

### Should Live *Only* in Dynamics

* Dissociation as regime alternation
* Instability phenomenology
* Failure modes taxonomy

---

### Should Live *Only* in Math

* Curvature metaphor
* Derivative orders
* State-space geometry

---

## V. Circularity Audit (Key Pass)

### Potential Loop

> Experience → UEF → intrinsic constraint → experience

**Why you’re currently safe**

* Spec defines **experience = UEF** (identity, not causation).
* Intrinsic constraint is defined **independently** of experience.
* UEF is defined in terms of constraint, not vice versa.

**Recommended reinforcement**

* Add one explicit sentence in the Spec:

  > “Intrinsic constraint is defined without reference to experience; experience is defined by reference to regimes of intrinsic constraint.”

This shuts the door decisively.

---

## VI. Ensuring Companions Derive, Not Compete

Add a **uniform derivation footer** to all non-spec files:

> “If any statement in this document appears to conflict with the IER v10.0 Normative Specification, the Specification takes precedence and this statement is void.”

It sounds legalistic — that’s good. It enforces hierarchy.

# I. Guiding Principle for Completion

> **The Normative Specification must remain closed.
> Completeness is achieved by *containment*, not expansion.**

Anything that:

* explains *limits*,
* clarifies *epistemic status*,
* prevents *misuse*,
* or disambiguates *implications*

**belongs outside the core**, even if logically implied.

So the right move is:

* **no edits to the Spec**
* **no inflation of the Theory**
* **2 short, sharply bounded companion articles**

Think of these as *guardrails*, not new rooms.

---

# II. What “Complete” Means for IER

IER is complete when it has explicit answers to all of these *meta-questions*:

1. What is experience?
2. When does it exist?
3. What necessarily follows?
4. What *does not* follow?
5. What experience can and cannot tell you about reality
6. How experience changes without changing its identity
7. How multiple experiential systems relate without merging

You already cover **1–4** fully.

The optional clarifications cleanly cover **5–7**.

---

# III. Recommended Additions (Exactly Two Articles)

## Article 1 — **Experiential Access vs Epistemic Access**

### Purpose

Prevent the single most dangerous misreading of IER:

> that meaningful or coherent experience has epistemic authority.

This article formalizes a distinction you already *use*, especially in the psychosis document, but never name at the framework level.

### Why this must be a new article

* Putting this in the Spec would look like an epistemology
* Putting it in Theory would blur scope
* As a standalone companion, it acts as a **firebreak**

### Proposed Title

**Experience Without Authority**
*Experiential Access, Epistemic Access, and the Limits of Meaning under IER*

### Outline

1. **Status and Scope**

   * Explanatory, non-normative
   * Introduces no new primitives
   * Derives from dual description + organizational identity

2. **The Core Distinction**

   * Experiential access: what it is like for a system
   * Epistemic access: what is true of the world
   * No entailment from the former to the latter

3. **Why Experience Feels Authoritative**

   * Coherence
   * Salience
   * Intrinsic constraint
   * Costliness of resolution

4. **Why This Authority Is Not Epistemic**

   * Constraint tracks viability, not truth
   * Salience ≠ evidence
   * Resolution ≠ correctness

5. **Implications**

   * Psychosis
   * Religious experience
   * Meaning and narrative
   * AI alignment risks

6. **Explicit Non-Claims**

   * IER does not validate insights
   * IER does not privilege experience epistemically
   * IER does not explain truth-tracking

7. **Where IER Stops**

   * Epistemology belongs elsewhere
   * Clinical validation belongs elsewhere
   * Science adjudicates truth, not experience

This article *locks down* interpretation without adding theory.

---

## Article 2 — **Continuity, Change, and Plasticity Within a UEF**

### Purpose

Make explicit how **experience can change deeply over time without becoming a different subject or violating categorical onset**.

This resolves latent questions about:

* development
* trauma
* recovery
* personality change
* learning

All already implied — just not consolidated.

### Why this must be separate

* Adding this to Dynamics would overload it
* Adding it to Theory would blur identity vs development
* As a standalone, it clarifies **diachronic structure**

### Proposed Title

**Persistence Under Constraint**
*Learning, Plasticity, and Change Within Unified Experiential Fields*

### Outline

1. **Status and Scope**

   * Explanatory
   * No new primitives
   * Derives from temporal continuity + intrinsic constraint

2. **Identity vs Configuration**

   * UEF identity conditions (unchanged)
   * Constraint topology (mutable)
   * Participation patterns (mutable)

3. **Learning Under IER**

   * Learning as reorganization of constraint pathways
   * Not accumulation of representations
   * Not change in experiential existence

4. **Trauma and Reweighting**

   * Constraint narrowing
   * Salience distortion
   * Reduced slack
   * Still the same UEF

5. **Recovery and Expansion**

   * Slack restoration
   * New stabilizers
   * Narrative reorganization

6. **What Cannot Happen**

   * Gradual partial subjects
   * Identity blending
   * Accretion of experience

7. **Relation to Ethics**

   * Responsibility modulation
   * Harm without loss of subjecthood

This completes the *temporal story* without touching the Spec.

---

# IV. Where Social Coupling Fits (Do Not Add a Third Article)

Social coupling should **not** get its own document.

Instead:

* Add **one short section** to *either* Ethics or Dynamics
* Title: *Coupling Without Collectivism*

This should:

* Explicitly deny group minds
* Explain strong reciprocal constraint shaping
* Clarify empathy and coordination

Keep it tight. One section is enough.

---

# V. What You Should Not Do

❌ Do not revise the Spec
❌ Do not expand the Theory further
❌ Do not formalize epistemology
❌ Do not add a taxonomy of experiential styles
❌ Do not add detection, metrics, or thresholds

Completion ≠ expansion.

---

# VI. Final “Complete IER” Structure

When done, the project will look like this:

### **Normative Core**

* IER-specification.md

### **Canonical Explanation**

* IER-theory.md

### **Derived Explanations**

* IER-dynamics.md
* IER-math.md
* IER-ethics.md

### **Boundary & Clarification Companions (NEW)**

* Experience Without Authority
* Persistence Under Constraint

### **Applications / Illustrations**

* Experiential pluralism & meaning
* Psychosis
* Architecture case
* Brainfeels

That is a **closed, disciplined, misuse-resistant framework**.
