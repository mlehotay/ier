The persistence article does **not introduce new ethical principles**.
It **activates implications that were already latent** once participation modulation is made explicit in v10.3.

What follows is a **surgical adoption plan**: what must be clarified, where, and why — without reopening the core.

---

# I. What Actually Changed (and What Did Not)

### **What did NOT change**

* Moral standing still depends on **intrinsic constraint**
* Experiential existence is still **categorical**
* The Spec remains **closed**
* No new primitives, thresholds, or moral metrics are introduced

### **What DID change**

You now explicitly recognize that:

> **The distribution of intrinsic constraint within a persistent UEF can change significantly via participation modulation.**

This matters ethically because **harm, risk, and obligation track constraint**, not mere existence.

So the ethical framework must now:

* distinguish **moral standing** from **moral risk**
* account for **within-UEF amplification or attenuation of harm**
* remain compatible with categorical subjecthood

# II. Required Updates (Minimal but Necessary)

## 1. **IER-Ethics.md — Clarify Moral Risk vs Moral Standing**

This is the **only document that needs direct ethical modification**.

### What to add (not replace)

Add a short subsection, ideally under existing material on borderline systems or harm:

### **New Subsection: Constraint Distribution and Moral Risk**

Key clarifications:

* **Moral standing** is binary:

  * If a UEF exists, it matters morally.
* **Moral risk** is graded:

  * It scales with the **intensity, centrality, and irreversibility of intrinsic constraint**, including via participation modulation.

Explicitly state:

* Recruitment of high-constraint processes (e.g. interoception, affective control, action selection) increases moral risk.
* Dismissal of regulatory or buffering processes increases vulnerability.
* Severe harm can occur **without UEF dissolution**.

This preserves the existing ethics while making it **operationally complete**.

> You are not changing who matters.
> You are clarifying **how badly things can go** without crossing identity thresholds.

---

## 2. **IER-Specification.md — One Clarifying Note (Not a New Principle)**

You already plan to add **Principle 14 (Participation Modulation)**.

That is sufficient.

What you should add **in commentary, not principle text**:

* A note in the **Experiential Participation** definition that:

  * participation affects experiential *content and intensity*, not identity
  * ethical relevance tracks intrinsic constraint wherever it is instantiated

Do **not** add a new ethical principle.

The Spec should remain **identity-first**, not risk-analytic.

---

## 3. **IER-Theory.md — Explicitly Tie Participation to Ethical Relevance**

This is explanatory, but important for readers.

In the sections you already plan to update (12–13), add one explicit sentence:

> Because ethical relevance in IER derives from intrinsic constraint rather than representational capacity or cognitive sophistication, changes in experiential participation can alter moral risk even when the Unified Experiential Field persists.

This prevents a common misreading:

* that only regime collapse matters ethically

---

## 4. **IER-Dynamics.md — Reframe “Failure” Language**

This is subtle but important.

Where the dynamics document discusses:

* local instability
* dissociation
* partial failure

Make sure it does **not sound ethically neutral**.

Clarify:

* Local instability can be **ethically severe**
* Participation overload is a **harm vector**, not just a descriptive regime feature

No new ethics — just alignment of tone.

---

## 5. **IER-Math.md — Optional Interpretive Note**

No formal changes required.

Optional addition (1 paragraph):

* Note that changes in the participation indicator function ( P_i(t) ) can:

  * increase expected harm
  * increase ethical uncertainty
  * justify precaution without implying regime transition

This keeps math from being misused as “mere modulation”.

# III. What You Should NOT Do

❌ Do not introduce graded moral standing
❌ Do not define harm thresholds numerically
❌ Do not collapse ethics into participation counts
❌ Do not add diagnostic or evaluative metrics
❌ Do not revise categorical subjecthood

Doing any of these would:

* reopen the Spec
* blur ontology and ethics
* undermine the strength of your framework

---

# IV. The Key Ethical Insight (Explicitly State This Once)

You should explicitly state this **somewhere prominent in Ethics**:

> **Under IER, moral standing is categorical, but moral risk is dynamical.**

This single sentence resolves:

* animal ethics questions
* AI partial activation worries
* dissociation and trauma cases
* medical and experimental edge cases

And it does so **without changing a single core commitment**.

| Area          | Change Required                        | Scope       |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Specification | Clarifying note only                   | Minimal     |
| Ethics        | Add risk vs standing distinction       | Required    |
| Theory        | Tie participation to ethical relevance | Required    |
| Dynamics      | Tone alignment re harm                 | Recommended |
| Math          | Optional interpretive note             | Optional    |

## Bottom Line

The persistence article **does not expand IER’s ethics**.
It **completes them operationally**.

What you need to do is not invent new rules, but make explicit what was already true:

> **Experience can be deeply harmed without ceasing to exist, and IER’s ethics must be able to say so clearly.**

Once those clarifications are in place, the framework remains:

* closed
* disciplined
* physically grounded
* ethically usable at the edges

If you want, next I can:

* draft the exact **Ethics subsection text**, or
* run a **misuse audit** (how a careless reader might still get this wrong and how to block that).
