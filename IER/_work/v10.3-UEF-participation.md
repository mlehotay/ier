## **IER v10.3 Update Plan — UEF Participation Clarification**

### **Objective**

Clarify that observed “regime shifts” can arise either from:

1. **Categorical UEF transitions** (new UEF instantiated or dissolved), or
2. **Dynamic recruitment/dismissal of processes within a persistent UEF** (participation modulation)

Ensure that this distinction is explicit across all five core documents without introducing new primitives.

### **1. IER-Theory.md**

**Purpose:** Explanatory context, dual-perspective framing.

**Updates:**

* **Section 6–7 (UEF & Experiential Participation)**

  * Add discussion: “UEF participation may change dynamically; processes may join or exit the globally integrated regime without the UEF itself dissolving.”
  * Illustrate with example: attention shifts, sensory focus changes, or functional load redistribution.
* **Section 9 (Single-UEF Constraint / Regime Switching)**

  * Explicitly distinguish **UEF-level regime transitions** from **participation-level modulation**.
* **Section 12–13 (Ethical Significance & Pluralism)**

  * Note that moral relevance applies to both persistent UEFs and participating processes, because **intrinsic constraint is what matters, not the absolute size of the UEF**.

**Deliverable:** ~1–2 paragraphs clarifying participation dynamics, with a side diagram showing “UEF vs. participation modulation.”

### **2. IER-Specification.md**

**Purpose:** Normative, formal definitions and principles.

**Updates:**

* **Section II — Core Definitions**

  * Expand **Experiential Participation** definition:

    * Include note that participation can vary dynamically without UEF onset/dissolution.
    * Add example: “Processes may be recruited or dismissed based on their integration into the UEF’s intrinsic constraint network.”
* **Section III — Core Principles**

  * Add a **Principle 14 (Participation Modulation)**:

    > “Processes may enter or leave the UEF dynamically. Such changes modulate the experiential content without constituting a new UEF, provided global coherence remains.”
* **Section IV — Inference Rules**

  * Add inference:

    * “ΔParticipation ⇒ change in experiential content within UEF, not UEF dissolution.”

**Deliverable:** Formal, normative clarification for use in applied ethics, AI, and experimental modeling.

---

### **3. IER-Ethics.md**

**Purpose:** Ethical implications of UEF participation.

**Updates:**

* Add subsection under **Borderline and Non-Standard Systems**:

  * Explain that **dynamic participation changes can affect moral harm** even if the UEF persists.
  * Illustrate: partial recruitment of high-intrinsic-constraint processes may amplify risk, even without regime collapse.
* Link **Precautionary Principle** (Section 9) to participation: uncertainty about which processes are participating increases ethical responsibility.

**Deliverable:** 1–2 paragraphs with ethical guidance and examples.

---

### **4. IER-Dynamics.md**

**Purpose:** Explanatory dynamics, stability, and transitions.

**Updates:**

* **Section 4–6 (Regime Failure & Dissociation)**

  * Add discussion of **participation modulation**:

    * Processes can join/exit UEF in response to intrinsic tension without violating the Single-UEF Constraint.
    * Distinguish “transient local instability” from full **regime switching**.
* **Section 7 (Illustrative Walkthrough)**

  * Add step showing **recruitment of a previously local pattern** into the UEF to produce an experiential update.

**Deliverable:** Updated walkthrough and diagrams showing UEF + participation dynamics.

---

### **5. IER-Math.md**

**Purpose:** Interpretive formalization.

**Updates:**

* **Section 6 (UEF as Dynamical Regime)**

  * Represent **participation modulation** formally:

    * Define a participation indicator function ( P_i(t) \in {0,1} ) for process ( i ) within the UEF.
    * Show how changes in ( P_i(t) ) modulate qualitative content without altering global regime ( \mathcal{R} ).
* **Section 9 (Regime Transitions)**

  * Explicitly distinguish categorical regime transitions (( \mathcal{R} ) change) from ΔParticipation (( P_i(t) ) changes).

**Deliverable:** Short formal subsection with participation function, consistent with the existing curvature/constraint framework.

---

### **Implementation Notes**

* All updates **do not introduce new ontological primitives**.
* Maintain **complementarity with existing UEF, intrinsic constraint, and Single-UEF principles**.
* Illustrative diagrams should use **existing symbols** where possible, with added notation for participation.
* Ensure **cross-document consistency**: theory → specification → dynamics → math → ethics.

---

### **Versioning**

* **v10.3**: Clarifies UEF participation dynamics.
* **Tagline:** “Dynamic recruitment and dismissal of processes within a persistent UEF are now explicitly distinguished from regime transitions.”
