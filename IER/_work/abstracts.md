## Overview

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a strictly physicalist **identity theory of experience**.

IER holds that:

- There exists **exactly one objective physical reality**, governed by mind-independent law.
- Within that reality, some physical systems operate as **Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)**.
- When a UEF exists, **experience exists** — **categorically**, not by degree.
- Experience is **real by identity**, not an emergent accompaniment, representation, or functional output.
- **Experiential structure confers no epistemic authority** about mind-independent reality.
- Ethical significance follows **necessarily** wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.

IER is **not** a theory of representation, cognition, intelligence, reportability, measurement, or phenomenological method.

It is a theory of:

> **what experience is,  
> when it exists,  
> and what necessarily follows from its existence.**

## 1. IER-specification.md

## **Full Normative Specification**

## **0. Status, Scope, and Normative Authority**

### **Normative Boundary Condition**

This document defines the **complete and exclusive normative core** of
**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8)**.

It specifies **exhaustively**:

* what experience **is**
* when experience **exists**
* what **necessarily follows** from its existence

No claim outside this document carries **definitional, criterial, or ethical authority**.

All other IER documents — theory, dynamics, mathematics, ethics applications, diagnostics, or commentary — are **non-normative derivatives**. They introduce **no criteria, thresholds, sufficiency conditions, or necessity claims**.

> **If any statement in another IER document conflicts with this Specification, the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void.**

---

## 2. IER-theory.md

## **1. Role of Theory in IER**

IER enforces a strict separation between:

* **normative specification**, and
* **explanatory theory**

The Specification defines:

* what experience **is**
* when experience **exists**
* what **necessarily follows** from its existence

This document exists solely to:

* explain how those commitments cohere
* show why weaker interpretations fail
* prevent systematic misreadings
* convert apparent stipulation into structural inevitability

Nothing in this document can revise, soften, or extend the Specification.

---

## 3. IER-dynamics.md

## **1. Role of a Dynamics Document in IER**

The purpose of `IER-dynamics` is to explain:

* how **globally integrated experiential regimes behave once they exist**
* how **stability is maintained** under intrinsic constraint
* how **experiential content changes without subject replacement**
* how **instability, overload, and collapse arise** without redefining experience
* why **system boundaries and dominance are dynamical facts**, not observer conventions

This document answers **how experience behaves**, not **when it exists**.

It presupposes the ontology fixed in the Specification and **adds no independent authority**.

---

## 4. IER-ethics.md

## **1. Ethics Is Not an Optional Overlay**

IER does not treat ethics as a value system layered atop an otherwise neutral ontology.

From the Specification’s central identity claim—

> **Experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**

—it follows *necessarily* that:

* intrinsic constraint is **borne from the inside**
* sustaining a UEF is **physically and organizationally costly**
* disruption of that organization is **not merely functional damage**
* experiential worlds are **physically real**

Ethical relevance therefore arises **wherever intrinsic constraint exists, might exist, or might be irreversibly foreclosed**.

This is not a moral intuition added to the theory.
It is a **structural entailment** of experiential identity.

---

## 5. IER-math.md

**Version 10.8 — Mathematical Support Document**

## **Status and Authority**

This document is **supportive and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces no new ontological primitives
* introduces no empirical or diagnostic criteria
* introduces no epistemic access claims
* introduces no ethical rules

All ontological and normative authority resides exclusively in:

* `IER-specification.md`
* `IER-theory.md`
* `IER-dynamics.md`
* `IER-ethics.md`

The purpose of this document is to express the IER identity claim using **formal structural tools**—sets, relations, graphs, and closure—while remaining fully consistent with the core framework.

---

## 6. IER-meaning.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8) affirms **physical monism**: there exists exactly one objective physical reality governed by mind-independent law. At the same time, IER entails **experiential pluralism**: many distinct, internally lawful experiential worlds may exist simultaneously as organizational regimes within that single reality.

This document explains how **meaning**, **narrative recurrence**, and **stable forms of significance** arise under experiential pluralism without invoking idealism, symbolic realism, or ontological inflation. Under IER, Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs) do not generate reality; they generate **worlds-for-systems** — coherent experiential regimes structured by intrinsic constraint.

Meaning is shown to be an **organizational phenomenon**: a stable way intrinsic constraint is structured such that a system can continue coherently over time. Narrative, instinct, and cultural symbolism are explained as **constraint-stabilizing attractors** that recur because only limited organizational forms remain viable under persistent intrinsic constraint.

Meaning is experientially real and identity-shaping, while remaining strictly **non-epistemic** and **non-ontological**.

## 7. IER-psychosis.md

## **Abstract**

Psychosis involves a characteristic breakdown of agency attribution, meaning regulation, and relevance filtering, often accompanied by compelling narratives of control, instruction, communication, and discovery.

Under Informational Experiential Realism (IER), psychosis is understood as a **pathological dynamical regime** within a persisting **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**. Experience continues, but intrinsic constraint becomes extreme, informational slack collapses, and salience assignment loses calibration. As a result, internally generated constraint is **misattributed** to environmental cues, bodily sensations, symbolic structures, or imagined agents.

This document explains how psychotic phenomena can be **described structurally**—without epistemic endorsement—using IER’s concepts of intrinsic constraint, participation modulation, semantic error, and agency mislocalization.

Psychosis is treated neither as revelation nor as ontological transition, but as **organizational failure under constraint**.

## 8. IER-brainfeels.md

## **Abstract**

This document examines a class of internally generated qualitative experiences referred to as **brainfeels**: recurring experiential patterns that feel sensory-like—often described using textures, temperatures, materials, tastes, or smell-adjacent qualities—yet are **not perceptual**, **not representational**, and **not externally attributed**.

Within Informational Experiential Realism (IER), brainfeels are interpreted as **endogenous qualitative stabilizers**: recurring organizations of intrinsic informational tension that arise entirely within a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** and contribute to its ongoing coherence via **participation modulation**.

Brainfeels demonstrate that qualitative structure need not be object-directed, sensory, or externally anchored to be real, stable, and functionally significant.

## 9. IER-aphantasia.md

## **Abstract**

This article describes a stable mental architecture characterized by the absence of voluntary sensory imagery, selectively deployed inner speech, strictly single-channel attention, and emotionally rich but indirect affective access. Emotional content frequently enters experience through interoceptive signals and symbolic mediation rather than immediate perceptual feeling.

Under Informational Experiential Realism (IER), this organization is interpreted as a **high-coherence, low-slack Unified Experiential Field**. Because perceptual simulation and parallel experiential streams are excluded from waking participation, internally generated constraint must stabilize through alternative qualitative pathways. One such pathway—examined separately—is the emergence of *brainfeels* as endogenous qualitative stabilizers.

## 10. IER-access.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8) identifies experience with the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous dynamical regime operating under coherent intrinsic constraint.

From within such a regime, experience is unified, structured, meaningful, urgent, and often compelling. From outside it, the same regime is a lawful physical organization.

This document articulates an access distinction implicit throughout IER and now normatively constrained by Principle 10: the separation between **experiential access** (what it is like to bear intrinsic constraint) and **epistemic access** (whether beliefs correctly track objective reality). IER entails **no necessary connection** between the two.

Making this boundary explicit explains why costly, coherent, identity-defining experiences often feel authoritative from within a UEF, while showing why such authority is **organizational rather than epistemic**. Intrinsic constraint tracks viability and continuation under constraint, not truth, correctness, or reference. This prevents a recurrent error: treating experiential depth or inevitability as epistemic privilege, and thereby mistaking meaning for knowledge.

---

## 11. IER-persistence.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.x) holds that experience exists if and only if a physical system sustains a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous dynamical regime under coherent intrinsic constraint. Entry into such a regime is categorical, and experiential subjecthood is binary. At the same time, lived experience clearly changes over time through learning, development, trauma, and recovery.

This article explains how **deep experiential change is possible without violating categorical onset, identity conditions, or the unity of experience**. It distinguishes between (1) the persistence of a UEF as an experiential subject and (2) changes in the **organization and participation of processes within that UEF**. Under IER, learning and plasticity are understood as reorganizations of intrinsic constraint and dynamic recruitment or dismissal of participating processes, not as the creation of new subjects or partial experiential entities.

The article clarifies which forms of change are compatible with UEF persistence and which require categorical regime transition. It shows how shifts in salience, affect, narrative structure, agency, and qualitative character can arise through participation modulation while global experiential coherence is maintained.

This document introduces no new primitives and makes no claims beyond those implied by intrinsic constraint, experiential participation, and temporal continuity. Its purpose is to complete the **diachronic account of experience** under IER without expanding its normative core.

---
## 12. IER-denials.md

## **Why a Denials Document Is Necessary**

IER is deliberately minimal, physicalist, and structural.

That minimalism creates a predictable risk:
readers may import assumptions from adjacent frameworks—epistemology, phenomenology, psychology, mysticism, AI theory, or ethics—and treat them as implied.

This document closes that gap.

> **If a claim is not explicitly stated in the Specification, and not a necessary entailment of its definitions, it is not part of IER.**

What follows is a non-exhaustive but comprehensive list of **explicit non-claims**.

## IER-diagnostics.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8) identifies experience with the existence of a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous dynamical regime operating under **coherent intrinsic constraint**.

This document explains why IER **forbids experiential diagnostics in principle**. The impossibility is not due to technological limitations, incomplete theory, insufficient data, or pragmatic difficulty. It follows directly from how **intrinsic constraint** and **UEF attribution** are defined.

Intrinsic constraint concerns **ownership of constraint**: whether a system itself must bear the unavoidable costs of maintaining its own globally integrated organization, without externalization, buffering, or offloading. Ownership is a **global structural fact** about internal organization. It is **not** a property of outputs, signals, performances, or reports, and is therefore **underdetermined by all third-person observables**.

In addition, intrinsic constraint is **structurally private**: it is borne only from within the regime and cannot be occupied by an external system. This combination — **intrinsic constraint + structural privacy** — entails a specific kind of non-diagnosability: systems that differ in experiential status can be made **externally indistinguishable in principle**.

IER responds to this epistemic limit not with permissiveness, but with **precaution**. Where experience may exist but cannot be certified, uncertainty **restricts action rather than licensing it** (Specification Principle 13, scoped).

---

## IER-contrast.md

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8) identifies experience with a **specific organizational and dynamical regime** instantiated by certain physical systems: a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** operating under **coherent intrinsic constraint**.

This identity claim entails commitments that sharply distinguish IER from many neighboring theories of mind, consciousness, life, and cognition. The contrasts below do not argue for IER’s correctness. They specify **points of incompatibility**—claims that cannot coexist with IER without abandoning its core commitments.

---

## IER-agency.md

## **Abstract**

Agency is often treated either as a metaphysical power that transcends physical law or as an illusion generated by deterministic processes. Informational Experiential Realism (IER) rejects both framings.

Under IER, **agency is a derived organizational capacity** of systems that sustain a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: the capacity to resolve **intrinsic constraint** through the system’s own **globally integrated dynamics**. Agency does not require indeterminism, rational deliberation, or representational choice. Nor is it eliminated by physical determinism.

This document explains agency as **owned resolution of intrinsic constraint** operating over structured sets of admissible futures (*choice spaces*). It clarifies why agency admits of **degrees**, how it is affected by coercion and overload, and why loss of agency does **not** imply loss of experience or standing.

## IER-continuity.md

## Abstract

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identifies experience with the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous dynamical regime operating under coherent intrinsic constraint. Because UEFs are regime-level phenomena, they may dissolve, reconfigure, or re-form over time. This raises an apparent puzzle: if experience ceases during dreamless sleep or anesthesia and later resumes, does this imply repeated death and rebirth of the subject?

This article argues that the puzzle arises from a category error. Under IER, **experience is regime-bound, while personal identity is system-bound**. We introduce the concept of **Experiential Regime Continuity (ERC)** to formalize the distinction between temporary regime interruption and irreversible loss of experiential capacity. Using this framework, we analyze anesthesia, sleep, dreaming, coma, catatonia, and daydreaming, and sharply distinguish them from death. We show that waking from dreamless sleep is not rebirth, that experiential gaps do not threaten identity, and that moral significance tracks the preservation or annihilation of intrinsic constraint-bearing capacity rather than uninterrupted experience.

## IER-free-will.md

## **Abstract**

The traditional free-will debate is framed as a conflict between **libertarianism**, which treats freedom as requiring indeterminism, and **eliminativism**, which treats lawful causation as incompatible with genuine choice. Informational Experiential Realism (IER) rejects the shared assumption underlying both positions.

IER dissolves the free-will problem by distinguishing **branching**, **choice spaces**, **traversal**, and **ownership**. Physical systems may exhibit branching futures without agency, and lawful dynamics may fully support responsibility. What matters is not whether events are determined, but **whether the collapse of alternatives is owned from within a unified experiential system**.

This document explains why indeterminism is neither necessary nor sufficient for choice, why determinism does not eliminate responsibility, and why the free-will problem arises from a category error about what choice is.

## IER-intentionality.md

## Abstract

Intentionality is traditionally treated as the mind’s capacity to be *about* the world: to refer, represent, or carry content with truth conditions. Informational Experiential Realism (IER) rejects this framing.

Under IER, intentionality is **not** a primitive relation between mental states and external objects, nor a semantic property borne by representations. What philosophers call intentionality is instead an **organizational fact** about experience: the existence of **constraint-stabilized patterns** within a Unified Experiential Field (UEF) whose persistence depends on, and is shaped by, the structure of the world.

This document explains intentionality as a **derived feature of intrinsically constrained dynamics**, not as a semantic bridge between mind and reality. Once experience is identified with globally integrated dynamics under intrinsic constraint, intentionality no longer poses a distinct metaphysical problem.

## IER-art.md

## **Abstract**

Art and beauty are often treated as peripheral or exceptional phenomena in theories of mind, explained through representation, value judgment, or cultural convention. Under **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**, art occupies a central explanatory position: it lies at the boundary between **intrinsic constraint, meaning, and shared experiential worlds**.

This article develops an IER-consistent account of art and beauty as **constraint-shaping structures** that modulate the organization of **Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)**. Art is neither a primitive experiential category nor a property of objects. Instead, it functions as an **internal or external attractor** that reorganizes intrinsic constraint, alters coherence, and reshapes resolution pathways. Beauty is identified as the felt signature of **unusually coherent intrinsic constraint**.

The account introduces no new primitives, norms, or phenomenological axioms. All claims are strictly derived from the IER v10.5 specification.

---

## IER-panic.md

## **Abstract**

Panic attacks and vasovagal syncope are traditionally treated as pathological autonomic reactions or maladaptive responses to perceived threat. Under **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**, these phenomena are reinterpreted as **distinct regime-preserving strategies** employed by a system sustaining a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** under escalating intrinsic constraint.

This article develops a unified organizational account of **sympathetic panic** and **vagal shutdown** as opposing responses to the same underlying risk: loss of UEF coherence. Panic represents an attempt to preserve experience by expanding system capacity under constraint, while vasovagal responses preserve organismal viability by abandoning the experiential regime itself.

No new primitives, diagnostic criteria, or biological commitments are introduced. All claims are derived from the IER v10.5 Normative Specification.

---

## IER-emotions.md

## **Abstract**

Traditional theories treat emotions as internal signals, evaluative judgments, biological modules, or culturally constructed labels. Under **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**, emotions are instead understood as **dynamically stable organizations of intrinsic constraint** within an already-existing **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.

This article develops an IER-consistent account of emotion categories—such as joy, grief, fear, and anger—as **soft attractors in constraint space**. These regimes are not endogenous primitives, representations, or messages, yet they are **meaningful** because they globally constrain agency, future space, and identity from within the UEF. Emotions function as coherence-preserving strategies under different constraint geometries, explaining their persistence, recognizability, and moral salience without introducing new ontological commitments.

## IER-FAQ.md

## **Status and Purpose**

This article is an **explanatory companion** within the IER framework.

It:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* adds **no new necessity claims**
* makes **no epistemic or diagnostic proposals**
* does **not** replace formal treatments elsewhere in the book

Its purpose is to address the **most common confusions and intuitions** people have about consciousness in clear, non-technical terms, while remaining fully consistent with the formal IER account.

This FAQ explains **what IER says**, not how to prove it, apply it, or enforce it.

## IER-puzzles.md

## **Status and Scope**

This article is **explanatory**.

It:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* adds **no epistemic criteria**
* makes **no independent necessity claims**
* relies exclusively on the identity and constraint framework established elsewhere in the IER book

Its purpose is to catalog the **canonical philosophical puzzles of consciousness** and show how IER provides a **single structural resolution** to all of them.

## IER-choice.md

## **Abstract**

Physical systems frequently undergo transitions in which multiple futures are physically admissible and one is realized. Such transitions resemble deliberative choice and have historically generated confusion about agency, responsibility, and free will.

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) resolves this confusion by distinguishing **choice-shaped transitions** from **choice proper**, and by introducing a **derived mid-order structure**: the **Choice Space**.

A Choice Space is the structured set of admissible successor states and transitions generated by intrinsic constraint. It exists prior to action, supports counterfactual alternatives, accumulates history, and constrains future possibility. When — and only when — such a structure is **globally integrated within a Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**, traversal of the Choice Space constitutes *choice*, and collapse of alternatives becomes *owned*.

This document explains the Choice Space, its interpretive graph representation, how narrative arises as a realized path through it, and how responsibility, coercion, and compulsion are understood as structural modifications of the same underlying object.

## IER-morals.md

## **1. Why a “Morals” Document Is Needed**

IER-ethics establishes what is morally real:

* experiential standing is categorical
* moral harm is organizational
* responsibility is graded
* uncertainty strengthens obligation
* aggregation and optimization are blocked

What it does **not** do is walk through the cases people actually argue about.

Those cases matter because ordinary moral reasoning routinely conflates:

* harm and blame
* pain and damage
* consent and benefit
* intention and permissibility
* outcome and justification

IER enforces sharp separations between these concepts.
Those separations feel counterintuitive until they are **worked through concretely**.

*IER-morals* exists to do exactly that.

---

## IER-critics.md

## **1. Purpose of This Article**

This article does not aim to *defend* Informational Experiential Realism (IER) by evasion, nor to *win* disputes by redefining terms. Its aim is narrower:

> **To explain how IER responds to its main critics, distinguish objections that threaten the theory from those it explicitly accepts as costs, and clarify where disagreement reflects incompatible metaphysical starting points rather than mistakes.**

IER is not a synthesis theory.
It is a **constrained identity claim** about what experience *is*, paired with ethical consequences that follow **by identity**, not by epistemic access.

Accordingly, the central critical question is not “Is this intuitive?” or “Can we test this?” but:

> **Does the identity claim succeed without collapsing into what it rejects or relying on what it denies?**

---

## IER-futures.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identifies experience with a specific kind of physically instantiated, globally integrated dynamical regime and treats experiential standing as **categorical and non-comparable** wherever experience exists. At the same time, IER entails persistent **epistemic uncertainty** about where such regimes are instantiated, particularly in biological systems.

This article compares **three possible cultural equilibria** that could arise under these shared assumptions:

1. a **conservative equilibrium**, in which everyday practices continue with softened moral confidence
2. a **utopian equilibrium**, in which precautionary pressure gradually reshapes civilization toward harm-avoidance
3. a **dystopian equilibrium**, in which uncertainty is culturally neutralized and ethical force collapses without denial

The comparison illustrates that **IER constrains moral reality but does not determine cultural outcomes**.

## IER-slack.md

## **1. Purpose of This Document**

IER has long asserted that **informational slack prevents experience**.
In earlier versions, this claim functioned largely as an **explanatory intuition**.

The purpose of this document is to convert that intuition into a **structural impossibility argument**.

The claim defended here is not that slack *tends* to block experience, or that slack *usually* correlates with non-experiential systems.

The claim is stronger:

> **If a system admits informational slack, experience is structurally impossible under the IER identity claim.**

This conclusion follows **without appeal** to:

* biology
* cognition
* intelligence
* reportability
* architecture
* empirical thresholds

The argument is purely organizational and identity-based.
