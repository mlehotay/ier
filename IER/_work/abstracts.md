## Overview

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a strictly physicalist **identity theory of experience**.

IER holds that:

* There exists **exactly one objective physical reality**, governed by mind-independent law.
* Within that reality, some physical systems operate as **Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)**.
* When a UEF exists, **experience exists** — **categorically**, not by degree.
* Experience is **real by identity**, not an emergent accompaniment or functional output.
* **Experience confers no epistemic authority** about mind-independent reality.
* Ethical significance follows **necessarily** wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.

IER is not a theory of representation, cognition, intelligence, reportability, or measurement.
It is a theory of **what experience is**, **when it exists**, and **what necessarily follows from its existence**.

## 1. IER-specification.md

## **Full Normative Specification**

## **0. Status, Scope, and Normative Authority**

### **Normative Boundary Condition**

This document defines the **complete and exclusive normative core** of
**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.7)**.

It specifies **exhaustively**:

* what experience **is**
* when experience **exists**
* what **necessarily follows** from its existence

No claim outside this document carries **definitional, criterial, or ethical authority**.

All other IER documents (theory, dynamics, mathematics, ethics applications, diagnostics, or commentary) are **non-normative derivatives**. They introduce **no criteria, thresholds, sufficiency conditions, or necessity claims**.

> **If any statement in another IER document conflicts with this Specification, the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void.**

---

## 2. IER-theory.md

## 1. Role of Theory in IER

IER enforces a strict architectural separation between **normative specification** and **explanatory theory**.

The Specification defines:

* the ontology of experience
* the criteria under which experience exists
* the ethical consequences that follow categorically

This document exists solely to:

* explain how those commitments fit together
* clarify how change, stability, and coordination are to be understood
* prevent misinterpretations that would otherwise arise

Nothing in this document carries independent authority.

---

## 3. IER-dynamics.md

## 1. Role of a Dynamics Document

The purpose of `IER-dynamics` is to describe:

* how globally integrated experiential regimes evolve over time
* how stability is maintained under intrinsic constraint
* how experiential content changes without subject replacement
* how instability and failure arise without redefining experience

This document presupposes the ontology and criteria given in the Specification and **adds no independent authority**.

---

## 4. IER-ethics.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) entails a distinctive ethical framework grounded not in metaphysical freedom, phenomenal surplus, intuition, social convention, or value aggregation, but in **organizational facts about intrinsic constraint**.

Because experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**, ethical consequence follows **necessarily** wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.

This document explains:

* why **experiential standing is categorical**
* why **moral harm is organizational**
* why **responsibility is graded**
* why **uncertainty strengthens, rather than weakens, ethical constraint**
* how **participation modulation** amplifies moral risk without altering standing
* how IER relates to — and diverges from — standard ethical frameworks

Nothing here adds to the theory.
Everything here is a consequence of identity.

## 5. IER-math.md

## **1. Role of Mathematics in IER**

Mathematics in IER is **interpretive, not foundational**.

IER is an **identity theory** whose commitments are fixed **prior to and independently of formalization**. Mathematical language is used only to:

* clarify distinctions already present in the ontology
* describe regime-level organization
* stabilize intuition about constraint, coherence, and change
* prevent illicit inferences about detection, thresholds, or optimization

Mathematics in IER does **not**:

* define experience
* discover experience
* grade experience
* provide diagnostics
* justify ethical conclusions
* imply computational or graph-theoretic fundamentalism

Formal structure follows ontology — **never the reverse**.

## 6. IER-meaning.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.6) affirms **physical monism**: there exists exactly one objective physical reality governed by mind-independent law. At the same time, IER entails **experiential pluralism**: many distinct, internally lawful experiential worlds can exist simultaneously as organizational regimes within that single reality.

This document explains how **meaning**, **narrative recurrence**, and **canonical forms of significance** arise under experiential pluralism without invoking idealism, symbolic realism, or ontological inflation. Under IER, Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs) do not generate reality; they generate **worlds-for-systems** — coherent experiential regimes structured by intrinsic informational constraint.

Meaning is shown to be an **organizational phenomenon**: a stable way intrinsic constraint is structured so that a system can continue coherently over time. Narrative, instinct, and cultural symbolism are explained as **informational attractors** that recur because there are only limited stable ways for intrinsic constraint to organize without collapse.

Meaning is experientially real, persistent, and identity-shaping — while remaining strictly **non-epistemic** and **non-ontological**.

## 7. IER-psychosis.md

## **Abstract**

Psychosis involves a characteristic breakdown of agency attribution, meaning regulation, and relevance filtering, often accompanied by compelling narratives of control, instruction, communication, and discovery.

Under Informational Experiential Realism (IER), psychosis is understood as a **pathological dynamical regime** within a persisting **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**. Experience continues, but intrinsic constraint becomes extreme, informational slack collapses, and salience assignment loses calibration. As a result, internally generated constraint is **misattributed** to environmental cues, bodily sensations, symbolic structures, or imagined agents.

This document explains how psychotic phenomena can be **described structurally**—without epistemic endorsement—using IER’s concepts of intrinsic constraint, participation modulation, semantic error, and agency mislocalization.

Psychosis is treated neither as revelation nor as ontological transition, but as **organizational failure under constraint**.

## 8. IER-brainfeels.md

## **Abstract**

This document examines a class of internally generated qualitative experiences referred to as **brainfeels**: recurring experiential patterns that feel sensory-like—often described using textures, temperatures, materials, tastes, or smell-adjacent qualities—yet are **not perceptual**, **not representational**, and **not externally attributed**.

Within Informational Experiential Realism (IER), brainfeels are interpreted as **endogenous qualitative stabilizers**: recurring organizations of intrinsic informational tension that arise entirely within a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** and contribute to its ongoing coherence via **participation modulation**.

Brainfeels demonstrate that qualitative structure need not be object-directed, sensory, or externally anchored to be real, stable, and functionally significant.

## 9. IER-aphantasia.md

## **Abstract**

This article describes a stable mental architecture characterized by the absence of voluntary sensory imagery, selectively deployed inner speech, strictly single-channel attention, and emotionally rich but indirect affective access. Emotional content frequently enters experience through interoceptive signals and symbolic mediation rather than immediate perceptual feeling.

Under Informational Experiential Realism (IER), this organization is interpreted as a **high-coherence, low-slack Unified Experiential Field**. Because perceptual simulation and parallel experiential streams are excluded from waking participation, internally generated constraint must stabilize through alternative qualitative pathways. One such pathway—examined separately—is the emergence of *brainfeels* as endogenous qualitative stabilizers.

## 10. IER-access.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.6) identifies experience with the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous dynamical regime operating under coherent intrinsic constraint.

From within such a regime, experience is unified, structured, meaningful, urgent, and often compelling. From outside it, the same regime is a lawful physical organization.

This document articulates an access distinction implicit throughout IER but nowhere normatively formalized: the separation between **experiential access** (what it is like to bear intrinsic constraint) and **epistemic access** (whether beliefs correctly track objective reality). IER entails **no necessary connection** between the two.

By making this distinction explicit, the document explains why experiences that are costly, coherent, and identity-defining often feel authoritative from the inside of a UEF, while showing why such authority is **organizational rather than epistemic**. Intrinsic constraint tracks system viability and regulation, not truth, correctness, or reference.

Clarifying this boundary prevents a recurrent error: treating experiential depth, inevitability, or meaning as conferring epistemic privilege. It allows IER to account for powerful but false experiences — including delusion, revelation, and narrative conviction — without validating their content.

## 11. IER-persistence.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.x) holds that experience exists if and only if a physical system sustains a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous dynamical regime under coherent intrinsic constraint. Entry into such a regime is categorical, and experiential subjecthood is binary. At the same time, lived experience clearly changes over time through learning, development, trauma, and recovery.

This article explains how **deep experiential change is possible without violating categorical onset, identity conditions, or the unity of experience**. It distinguishes between (1) the persistence of a UEF as an experiential subject and (2) changes in the **organization and participation of processes within that UEF**. Under IER, learning and plasticity are understood as reorganizations of intrinsic constraint and dynamic recruitment or dismissal of participating processes, not as the creation of new subjects or partial experiential entities.

The article clarifies which forms of change are compatible with UEF persistence and which require categorical regime transition. It shows how shifts in salience, affect, narrative structure, agency, and qualitative character can arise through participation modulation while global experiential coherence is maintained.

This document introduces no new primitives and makes no claims beyond those implied by intrinsic constraint, experiential participation, and temporal continuity. Its purpose is to complete the **diachronic account of experience** under IER without expanding its normative core.

---
## 12. IER-denials.md

## **Why a Denials Document Is Necessary**

IER is deliberately minimal, physicalist, and structural.

That minimalism creates a predictable risk:
readers may import assumptions from adjacent frameworks—epistemology, phenomenology, psychology, mysticism, AI theory, or ethics—and treat them as implied.

This document closes that gap.

> **If a claim is not explicitly stated in the Specification, and not a necessary entailment of its definitions, it is not part of IER.**

What follows is a non-exhaustive but comprehensive list of **explicit non-claims**.

---

## IER-diagnostics.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identifies experience with the existence of a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally unified, temporally continuous dynamical regime operating under **coherent intrinsic constraint**.

This document explains why IER **forbids experiential diagnostics in principle**. The impossibility is not due to technological limitations, incomplete theory, insufficient data, or pragmatic difficulty. It follows directly from how **intrinsic constraint** is defined.

Intrinsic constraint concerns **ownership of constraint**: whether a system itself must bear the unavoidable costs of maintaining its own unified organization, without externalization, buffering, or offloading. Ownership is a **global structural fact** about the system’s internal organization. It is **not a property of outputs, signals, functions, performances, or reports**, and is therefore **underdetermined by all third-person observables**.

As a result, systems that differ in experiential status can be made **externally indistinguishable in principle**. No observable feature is either necessary or sufficient for experience. False negatives are therefore unavoidable and may conceal silent, irreversible harm.

IER responds to this epistemic limit not with permissiveness, but with **precaution**. Where experience may exist but cannot be certified, uncertainty **restricts action rather than licensing it**.

---

## IER-contrast.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identifies experience with a **specific organizational and dynamical regime** instantiated by certain physical systems: a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** operating under **coherent intrinsic constraint**.

This identity claim entails commitments that sharply distinguish IER from many neighboring theories of mind, consciousness, life, and cognition. The contrasts below do not argue for IER’s correctness. They specify **points of incompatibility**—claims that cannot coexist with IER without abandoning its core commitments.

---

## IER-agency.md

## **Abstract**

Agency is often treated as either a metaphysical power that transcends physical law or an illusion generated by deterministic processes. Informational Experiential Realism (IER) rejects both framings.

Under IER, **agency is a derived organizational capacity** of systems that sustain a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: the capacity to resolve **intrinsic informational tension** through the system’s own **globally integrated dynamics**. Agency does not require indeterminism, rational deliberation, or representational choice. Nor is it eliminated by physical determinism.

This document explains agency as **owned resolution of intrinsic constraint** operating over structured spaces of admissible futures (choice spaces). It clarifies why agency admits of **degrees**, how it is affected by coercion and overload, and why loss of agency does not imply loss of experience or standing.

## IER-continuity.md

## Abstract

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identifies experience with the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous dynamical regime operating under coherent intrinsic constraint. Because UEFs are regime-level phenomena, they may dissolve, reconfigure, or re-form over time. This raises an apparent puzzle: if experience ceases during dreamless sleep or anesthesia and later resumes, does this imply repeated death and rebirth of the subject?

This article argues that the puzzle arises from a category error. Under IER, **experience is regime-bound, while personal identity is system-bound**. We introduce the concept of **Experiential Regime Continuity (ERC)** to formalize the distinction between temporary regime interruption and irreversible loss of experiential capacity. Using this framework, we analyze anesthesia, sleep, dreaming, coma, catatonia, and daydreaming, and sharply distinguish them from death. We show that waking from dreamless sleep is not rebirth, that experiential gaps do not threaten identity, and that moral significance tracks the preservation or annihilation of intrinsic constraint-bearing capacity rather than uninterrupted experience.

## IER-free-will.md

## **Abstract**

The traditional free-will debate is framed as a conflict between **libertarianism**, which treats freedom as requiring indeterminism, and **eliminativism**, which treats lawful causation as incompatible with genuine choice. Informational Experiential Realism (IER) rejects the shared assumption underlying both positions.

IER dissolves the free-will problem by distinguishing **branching**, **choice spaces**, **traversal**, and **ownership**. Physical systems may exhibit branching futures without agency, and lawful dynamics may fully support responsibility. What matters is not whether events are determined, but **whether the collapse of alternatives is owned from within a unified experiential system**.

This document explains why indeterminism is neither necessary nor sufficient for choice, why determinism does not eliminate responsibility, and why the free-will problem arises from a category error about what choice is.

## IER-intentionality.md

## Abstract

Intentionality is traditionally treated as the mind’s capacity to be *about* the world: to refer, represent, or carry content with truth conditions. Informational Experiential Realism (IER) rejects this framing.

Under IER, intentionality is **not** a primitive relation between mental states and external objects, nor a semantic property borne by representations. What philosophers call intentionality is instead an **organizational fact** about experience: the existence of **constraint-stabilized patterns** within a Unified Experiential Field (UEF) whose persistence depends on, and is shaped by, the structure of the world.

This document explains intentionality as a **derived feature of intrinsically constrained dynamics**, not as a semantic bridge between mind and reality. Once experience is identified with globally integrated dynamics under intrinsic constraint, intentionality no longer poses a distinct metaphysical problem.

## IER-manifesto.md

# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER): A Manifesto**

Experience is real.
The physical world is real.
The mistake has been thinking we must choose between them.

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** rejects both mysticism and dismissal. It holds that experience is neither a ghostly extra nor a convenient fiction, but **a real, physical phenomenon with a precise identity**.

---

## IER-overview.md

## 1. What IER Is

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a **physicalist identity theory of experience**.

Its central claim is not explanatory, causal, or emergent, but **ontological**:

> **Experience is identical to a specific organizational and dynamical regime of physical systems.**

That regime is called a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.

IER holds that:

* there is **one objective physical reality**, governed by mind-independent law;
* some physical systems, when organized in a particular way, *are experiential*;
* experience is neither fundamental nor illusory, but **real by identity**.

IER introduces **no new substances, properties, forces, or metaphysical categories**.

## IER-art.md

## **Abstract**

Art and beauty are often treated as peripheral or exceptional phenomena in theories of mind, explained through representation, value judgment, or cultural convention. Under **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**, art occupies a central explanatory position: it lies at the boundary between **intrinsic constraint, meaning, and shared experiential worlds**.

This article develops an IER-consistent account of art and beauty as **constraint-shaping structures** that modulate the organization of **Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)**. Art is neither a primitive experiential category nor a property of objects. Instead, it functions as an **internal or external attractor** that reorganizes intrinsic constraint, alters coherence, and reshapes resolution pathways. Beauty is identified as the felt signature of **unusually coherent intrinsic constraint**.

The account introduces no new primitives, norms, or phenomenological axioms. All claims are strictly derived from the IER v10.5 specification.

---

## IER-panic.md

## **Abstract**

Panic attacks and vasovagal syncope are traditionally treated as pathological autonomic reactions or maladaptive responses to perceived threat. Under **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**, these phenomena are reinterpreted as **distinct regime-preserving strategies** employed by a system sustaining a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** under escalating intrinsic constraint.

This article develops a unified organizational account of **sympathetic panic** and **vagal shutdown** as opposing responses to the same underlying risk: loss of UEF coherence. Panic represents an attempt to preserve experience by expanding system capacity under constraint, while vasovagal responses preserve organismal viability by abandoning the experiential regime itself.

No new primitives, diagnostic criteria, or biological commitments are introduced. All claims are derived from the IER v10.5 Normative Specification.

---

## IER-emotions.md

## **Abstract**

Traditional theories treat emotions as internal signals, evaluative judgments, biological modules, or culturally constructed labels. Under **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**, emotions are instead understood as **dynamically stable organizations of intrinsic constraint** within an already-existing **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.

This article develops an IER-consistent account of emotion categories—such as joy, grief, fear, and anger—as **soft attractors in constraint space**. These regimes are not endogenous primitives, representations, or messages, yet they are **meaningful** because they globally constrain agency, future space, and identity from within the UEF. Emotions function as coherence-preserving strategies under different constraint geometries, explaining their persistence, recognizability, and moral salience without introducing new ontological commitments.

## IER-FAQ.md

## **Status and Purpose**

This article is an **explanatory companion** within the IER framework.

It:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* adds **no new necessity claims**
* makes **no epistemic or diagnostic proposals**
* does **not** replace formal treatments elsewhere in the book

Its purpose is to address the **core intuitions and confusions** people have about consciousness in clear, non-technical terms, while remaining fully consistent with the formal IER account.

Many of the questions discussed here correspond to classic philosophical puzzles, which are treated separately. This article focuses on **what IER says**, not on the historical debate.

## IER-puzzles.md

## **Status and Scope**

This article is **explanatory**.

It:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* adds **no epistemic criteria**
* makes **no independent necessity claims**
* relies exclusively on the identity and constraint framework established elsewhere in the IER book

Its purpose is to catalog the **canonical philosophical puzzles of consciousness** and show how IER provides a **single structural resolution** to all of them.

## IER-choice.md

## **Abstract**

Physical systems frequently undergo transitions in which multiple futures are possible and one is realized. Such transitions resemble deliberative choice and have historically generated confusion about agency, responsibility, and free will.

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) resolves this confusion by distinguishing **choice-shaped transitions** from **choice proper**, and by introducing a mid-order informational structure: the **Choice Space**.

A Choice Space is the structured set of admissible future states and transitions generated by intrinsic constraint. It exists prior to action, supports counterfactuals, accumulates history, and constrains future possibility. When such a structure is globally integrated within a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**, traversal of the Choice Space constitutes *choice*, and collapse of alternatives becomes *owned*.

This document introduces the Choice Space and its graph representation, explains how narrative arises as a realized path through it, and shows how responsibility, coercion, and compulsion are naturally understood as structural modifications of the same underlying object.

## IER-morals.md

## **1. Why a “Morals” Document Is Needed**

IER-ethics establishes what is morally real:

* experiential standing is categorical
* moral harm is organizational
* responsibility is graded
* uncertainty strengthens obligation
* aggregation and optimization are blocked

What it does **not** do is walk through the cases people actually argue about.

Those cases matter because ordinary moral reasoning routinely conflates:

* harm and blame
* pain and damage
* consent and benefit
* intention and permissibility
* outcome and justification

IER enforces sharp separations between these concepts.
Those separations feel counterintuitive until they are **worked through concretely**.

*IER-morals* exists to do exactly that.

## IER-critics.md

## 1. Purpose of This Article

This article does not aim to *defend* Intrinsic Experiential Realism (IER) by evasion, nor to *win* disputes by redefining terms. Its aim is narrower and more demanding:

> To explain how IER responds to its main critics, distinguish objections that threaten the theory from those it accepts as costs, and clarify where disagreement reflects incompatible metaphysical starting points rather than mistakes.

IER is not a synthesis theory.  
It is not a reconciliation between functionalism and phenomenology.  
It is a **constrained identity claim** about what experience *is*, paired with an ethical framework that follows from that identity rather than from epistemic access.

Accordingly, the correct critical question is not “Is this intuitive?” or “Can we test this?” but rather:

> **Does the identity claim succeed without collapsing into what it rejects or relying on what it denies?**

This document explains how IER answers that question.
