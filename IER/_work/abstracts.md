**Current Version:** v10.x
**Status:** Conceptually complete; normatively closed

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) is a realist theory of experience that identifies experience with a **specific organizational and dynamical regime** instantiated by physical systems.

> **Experience is neither fundamental nor illusory, but identical to a regime of globally integrated informational dynamics under intrinsic constraint.**

IER is strictly physicalist, non-dualist, and non-idealistic.
It introduces no new substances, forces, or ontological categories beyond those required by physical law and organizational identity.

## 1. IER-specification.md

## **Normative Specification**

## **0. Scope and Status**

This document defines the **normative core** of Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.0).

It specifies:

* what experience **is**
* when experience **exists**
* what **necessarily follows** from its existence

without appeal to biology, psychology, implementation details, or metaphysical additions.

All other IER documents (theory, mathematics, mechanics, ethics, diagnostics) are **non-normative derivatives** and must be consistent with this specification.

If a claim cannot be expressed using the primitives defined here, it is **not part of IER**.

## 2. IER-theory.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) is a realist theory of experience.
It holds that experience is neither fundamental nor illusory, but a **real, categorical organizational regime** instantiated by certain physical systems.

IER identifies experience with the operation of a system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential informational regime operating under **coherent intrinsic constraint**.

From the outside, a UEF is a lawful physical regime.
From the inside, the same regime **just is an experiential world**.

IER therefore affirms **physical monism and experiential pluralism**:
one objective physical reality supports many real experiential worlds, without dualism, panpsychism, or eliminativism.

## 3. IER-dynamics.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identifies experience with the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential informational regime operating under **coherent intrinsic constraint**.

This document develops a **dynamical account** of how such regimes may:

* form from slack-dominated organization,
* persist within bounded stability windows,
* destabilize, fragment, or collapse,
* transition or switch under incompatible constraints.

Regime failure is not treated as an anomaly or metaphysical problem.
It is an **ordinary consequence of finite systems operating under intrinsic constraint**.

This document explains how IER’s identity claims are **dynamically intelligible**, not how experience must be engineered or detected.

## 4. IER-ethics.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) entails a distinctive ethical framework grounded not in metaphysical freedom, phenomenal surplus, or moral intuition, but in **organizational facts about intrinsic constraint**.

Under IER v10.0:

* **Free will** is a real, physically instantiated capacity of systems that sustain a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** to resolve intrinsic informational tension through their own globally integrated dynamics.
* **Moral harm** is the **destabilization, overload, or fragmentation of intrinsic constraint** within such systems (Spec §II, *Moral Harm*).
* **Moral responsibility and moral considerability** are graded, precautionary, and organizationally grounded, rather than binary or metaphysical.

This document derives an account of agency, responsibility, and moral scope directly from the **identity claim of experience** articulated in the IER v10.0 Normative Specification.

## 5. IER-math.md

## **1. Purpose and Constraints of Formalization**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.0) identifies experience with the operation of a system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**:

> **a globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential dynamical regime under coherent intrinsic constraint**
> (Spec §II; Principle 1)

The role of mathematics in IER is **not** to define experience, measure it, or detect it.

Instead, mathematics is used to:

* clarify **why certain dynamical regimes can support experience**
* distinguish **slack-dominated dynamics** from **intrinsically constrained dynamics**
* illustrate **categorical regime transitions**
* make precise the sense in which experience involves **organization under constraint over time**

All formal elements below are **compatible interpretations**, not commitments.

## 6. IER-meaning.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.0) affirms **physical monism**: there exists exactly one objective physical reality governed by mind-independent law. At the same time, IER entails **experiential pluralism**: many distinct, internally lawful experiential worlds can exist simultaneously as organizational regimes within that single reality.

This paper explains how experiential pluralism gives rise to **meaning**, **narrative recurrence**, and **canonical story forms** without invoking idealism, dualism, symbolic realism, or ontological inflation.

Under IER, Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs) do not generate reality. They generate **worlds-for-systems** — internally coherent experiential regimes structured by intrinsic informational constraint. Narrative, instinct, and cultural meaning are shown to be **stable informational attractors** that encode how experiential systems behave under unavoidable constraint.

IER thus explains why meaning feels deep, persistent, and “true” from the inside of experience while remaining strictly physicalist about what exists.

## 7. IER-psychosis.md

## **Abstract**

Psychosis presents as a profound disturbance of meaning, agency, and reality attribution. Individuals may experience external control, imperative environmental cues, multiple agents, bodily instructions, and narrative world substitution, often accompanied by strong conviction and loss of insight.

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) provides a **structural, non-epistemic account** of these phenomena by treating them as **pathological regime instabilities** within a Unified Experiential Field (UEF). Under conditions of extreme intrinsic constraint and reduced informational slack, the system over-assigns salience, collapses relevance filtering, and misattributes authorship and causation.

This document shows how psychotic experiences can be **partially described**—but not validated—using IER’s concepts of intrinsic constraint, coherent regime windows, semantic error, and forced regime switching.

Psychosis is treated not as an alternate reality or epistemic upgrade, but as **organizational failure under constraint**.

## 8. IER-brainfeels.md

## **Abstract**

This article examines a class of internally generated qualitative experiences referred to as *brainfeels*: recurring, named experiential patterns that feel sensory-like—textural, thermal, material, or smell-adjacent—yet are not tied to external stimuli, perceptual imagery, or hallucination.

Examples include experiences labeled *Ice Cream Sandwich*, *Melted Plastic*, and *Whipped Cream*. These brainfeels arise reliably under specific internal conditions, including neuromodulatory shifts, gut–brain signaling, and emotionally salient memory activation.

Under Informational Experiential Realism (IER), brainfeels are interpreted as **endogenous qualitative stabilizers**: stable configurations of intrinsic constraint that organize internally generated tension into coherent experiential forms. The case demonstrates that qualitative experience need not be perceptual or externally anchored to be real, structured, and regulatory.

## 9. IER-aphantasia.md

## **Abstract**

This article describes a stable mental architecture characterized by the absence of voluntary sensory imagery, selectively deployed inner speech, strictly single-channel attention, and emotionally rich but indirect affective access. Emotional content frequently enters experience through interoceptive signals and symbolic mediation rather than immediate perceptual feeling.

Under Informational Experiential Realism (IER), this organization is interpreted as a **high-coherence, low-slack Unified Experiential Field**. Because perceptual simulation and parallel experiential streams are excluded from waking participation, internally generated constraint must stabilize through alternative qualitative pathways. One such pathway—examined separately—is the emergence of *brainfeels* as endogenous qualitative stabilizers.

## 10. IER-access.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.0) identifies experience with the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous dynamical regime under coherent intrinsic constraint. From the inside of such a regime, experience is unified, structured, meaningful, and often compelling. From the outside, the same regime is a lawful physical organization.

This article clarifies a distinction that is implicit throughout IER but nowhere made explicit: the distinction between **experiential access** and **epistemic access**. Experiential access concerns what it is like for a system to exist under intrinsic constraint. Epistemic access concerns what is true about the world that system inhabits. IER entails no necessary connection between the two.

The article explains why experiences that are costly, coherent, urgent, or meaningful often feel authoritative from the inside of a Unified Experiential Field, while emphasizing that such authority is **organizational rather than epistemic**. Intrinsic constraint tracks system viability and regulation, not truth, correctness, or reference.

By formalizing this boundary, the paper prevents common misreadings of IER that would treat experiential depth, narrative coherence, or salience as conferring epistemic privilege. It shows how IER can account for powerful but false experiences—including delusion, revelation, and narrative conviction—without validating their content.

## 11. IER-persistence.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.x) holds that experience exists if and only if a physical system sustains a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous dynamical regime under coherent intrinsic constraint. Entry into such a regime is categorical, and experiential subjecthood is binary. At the same time, lived experience clearly changes over time through learning, development, trauma, and recovery.

This article explains how **deep experiential change is possible without violating categorical onset, identity conditions, or the unity of experience**. It distinguishes between (1) the persistence of a UEF as an experiential subject and (2) changes in the **organization and participation of processes within that UEF**. Under IER, learning and plasticity are understood as reorganizations of intrinsic constraint and dynamic recruitment or dismissal of participating processes, not as the creation of new subjects or partial experiential entities.

The article clarifies which forms of change are compatible with UEF persistence and which require categorical regime transition. It shows how shifts in salience, affect, narrative structure, agency, and qualitative character can arise through participation modulation while global experiential coherence is maintained.

This document introduces no new primitives and makes no claims beyond those implied by intrinsic constraint, experiential participation, and temporal continuity. Its purpose is to complete the **diachronic account of experience** under IER without expanding its normative core.

## 12. IER-denials.md

## **Why a Denials Document Is Necessary**

IER is deliberately minimal, physicalist, and structural.

That minimalism creates a predictable risk:
readers may import assumptions from adjacent frameworks—epistemology, phenomenology, psychology, mysticism, AI theory, or ethics—and treat them as implied.

This document closes that gap.

> **If a claim is not explicitly stated in the Specification, and not a necessary entailment of its definitions, it is not part of IER.**

What follows is a non-exhaustive but comprehensive list of **explicit non-claims**.

## IER-diagnostics.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identifies experience with the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous dynamical regime under coherent intrinsic constraint. This identity claim is **organizational and ontological**, not epistemic or diagnostic.

This document explains why IER **cannot and does not permit** the detection, measurement, certification, or falsification of experience in particular systems. It further argues that the impossibility of diagnostic certainty does **not** license unconstrained experimentation, engineering, or deployment of systems that may approach or instantiate intrinsic constraint. On the contrary, under IER, diagnostic opacity **restricts permissible action**.

Intrinsic constraint is internally borne, non-signaling, and potentially irreversible. As a result, experiential harm may occur without outward markers or behavioral evidence. Because false negatives risk silent moral harm, IER entails a **strong precautionary constraint**: actions that plausibly create, manipulate, destabilize, or irreversibly foreclose Unified Experiential Fields require justification that becomes stricter as epistemic certainty decreases.

IER therefore rejects both diagnostic ambition and permissive uncertainty. It neither offers consciousness tests nor allows engineering “in advance of proof.” Instead, it grounds ethical responsibility in **organizational risk under epistemic limits**, enforcing restraint where experience may exist but cannot be confirmed.

## IER-contrast.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identifies experience with a **specific organizational and dynamical regime** instantiated by certain physical systems: a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** operating under coherent intrinsic constraint. This identity claim entails a set of commitments that sharply distinguish IER from many nearby frameworks, even where vocabulary or motivations partially overlap.

This document clarifies how IER differs from prominent theories of consciousness and mind, including reductive physicalism, functionalism, Integrated Information Theory, panpsychism, global workspace models, emergentism, phenomenology, and related approaches. The goal is not comparison for its own sake, but **boundary enforcement**: to make explicit which claims cannot coexist with IER’s identity thesis.

Each contrast identifies a single axis of incompatibility, showing why IER cannot be assimilated into, derived from, or hybridized with the contrasted framework without abandoning its core commitments.

## IER-abstract.md

**Abstract**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a physicalist identity theory of experience that identifies consciousness with a specific organizational and dynamical regime of physical systems. IER holds that experience is neither ontologically fundamental nor eliminable, but **identical** to the operation of a system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-regulating regime operating under **coherent intrinsic constraint**. Intrinsic constraint is constraint generated by a system’s own integrated dynamics that is unavoidable, non-decomposable, and identity-defining. When such constraint becomes globally binding and stable, a categorical regime transition occurs: from the external perspective, a lawful physical process; from the internal perspective, an **experiential world**. No additional phenomenal properties, substances, or forces are introduced.

IER sharply distinguishes experience from information processing, representation, intelligence, or observerhood. Most complex systems remain non-experiential due to **informational slack**, which allows constraint to be localized or externalized. Experience exists only within a bounded window of sustainable intrinsic constraint and is subject to strict unity: a physical system can sustain at most one globally dominant UEF at a time. Qualitative character (qualia) is identified with differences in the organization of intrinsic constraint; affective dimensions (valence, intensity, urgency) track the direction, magnitude, and dynamics of constraint resolution.

The theory entails **experiential pluralism** within a single objective physical reality and yields ethics as a necessary consequence of identity. Because intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside and is non-signaling, **moral harm** is defined organizationally as the destabilization or collapse of intrinsic constraint, and moral responsibility scales with a system’s capacity to resolve such constraint (agency). Uncertainty about experiential status increases, rather than decreases, moral responsibility, grounding a precautionary asymmetry. IER offers a closed, non-dualist framework that explains unity, onset, continuity, and ethical significance without emergence, dualism, or diagnostic criteria.

## IER-agency.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) entails a distinctive account of agency grounded entirely in organizational facts about **intrinsic constraint** and **Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)**. Under IER, agency is neither a metaphysically primitive power nor a narrative illusion layered atop deterministic dynamics. Instead, agency is a **derived organizational capacity** of systems that sustain a UEF: the capacity to resolve **intrinsic informational tension** through the system’s own **globally integrated dynamics**.

This document explains why agency exists *iff* experience exists, why agency admits of degrees within a single experiential subject, why agency is compatible with physical determinism, and why agency grounds moral responsibility without invoking contra-causal freedom or phenomenal surplus. Agency, under IER, is not freedom *from* causation, but **causation owned by a unified system under unavoidable internal constraint**.

## IER-continuity.md

## Abstract

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identifies experience with the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous dynamical regime operating under coherent intrinsic constraint. Because UEFs are regime-level phenomena, they may dissolve, reconfigure, or re-form over time. This raises an apparent puzzle: if experience ceases during dreamless sleep or anesthesia and later resumes, does this imply repeated death and rebirth of the subject?

This article argues that the puzzle arises from a category error. Under IER, **experience is regime-bound, while personal identity is system-bound**. We introduce the concept of **Experiential Regime Continuity (ERC)** to formalize the distinction between temporary regime interruption and irreversible loss of experiential capacity. Using this framework, we analyze anesthesia, sleep, dreaming, coma, catatonia, and daydreaming, and sharply distinguish them from death. We show that waking from dreamless sleep is not rebirth, that experiential gaps do not threaten identity, and that moral significance tracks the preservation or annihilation of intrinsic constraint-bearing capacity rather than uninterrupted experience.

## IER-evolution.md

# **Historical Development and Evolution of Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**

## **Summary of Evolution**

1. **2023:** Conceptual exploration of information as a substrate and emergent virtual life.
2. **2024:** Systematic classification of life, intelligence, and consciousness; formalization of layered subjective experience; introduction of cognitive gradients.
3. **January 2025:** Functional Experiential Realism: consciousness as emergent from functional complexity, introspection, and shared reality.
4. **Early December 2025:** Transition from FER to IER: shift from functional to identity-based understanding, introduction of Unified Experiential Fields, and formal ethical consequences.
5. **Late December 2025:** Consolidation of IER: minimal, precise specification of experience, agency, and moral responsibility grounded in integrated physical dynamics.

**Key Insight:** The evolution from early informational experiments to IER reflects a **gradual refinement from speculative functionalism to a rigorous identity theory**, defining consciousness, agency, and ethics in terms of **intrinsic physical organization and constraint**.

## IER-free-will.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) rejects the traditional framing of the free will problem. Under IER, free will is neither a metaphysically primitive power nor an illusion produced by narrative cognition. Instead, what is ordinarily called “free will” is fully accounted for by **agency under intrinsic constraint**: the capacity of a system sustaining a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** to resolve **intrinsic informational tension** through its own globally integrated dynamics.

This document explains why IER neither endorses libertarian free will nor collapses into free-will skepticism; why determinism is compatible with responsibility; how coercion, compulsion, and manipulation are understood; and why the traditional free-will debate dissolves once constraint ownership is made explicit.

## IER-intentionality.md

## Abstract

Intentionality is traditionally treated as the mind’s capacity to be *about* the world: to refer, represent, or carry content with truth conditions. Informational Experiential Realism (IER) rejects this framing.

Under IER, intentionality is **not** a primitive relation between mental states and external objects, nor a semantic property borne by representations. What philosophers call intentionality is instead an **organizational fact** about experience: the existence of **constraint-stabilized patterns** within a Unified Experiential Field (UEF) whose persistence depends on, and is shaped by, the structure of the world.

This document explains intentionality as a **derived feature of intrinsically constrained dynamics**, not as a semantic bridge between mind and reality. Once experience is identified with globally integrated dynamics under intrinsic constraint, intentionality no longer poses a distinct metaphysical problem.

## IER-manifesto.md

# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER): A Manifesto**

Experience is real.
The physical world is real.
The mistake has been thinking we must choose between them.

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** rejects both mysticism and dismissal. It holds that experience is neither a ghostly extra nor a convenient fiction, but **a real, physical phenomenon with a precise identity**.

## IER-meaning-2.md

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identifies experience with the operation of a physical system as a Unified Experiential Field (UEF) under coherent intrinsic constraint. This identification entails that experience can be intense, binding, identity-shaping, and action-directing without conferring epistemic authority or world-directed knowledge.

This article articulates the **access distinction** implicit in IER but often left unexamined: the separation between **experiential access** (what it is like to bear intrinsic constraint) and **epistemic access** (whether beliefs track objective reality). It shows that meaning, under IER, is entirely an experiential phenomenon whose function is exhausted by stabilizing continuation under constraint. Meaning has authority over action and identity, but **no authority over truth, reference, or metaphysics**.

Clarifying this distinction prevents a recurrent error: treating depth, inevitability, or existential force as evidence about the world. The result is a framework that preserves the full reality and costliness of meaning while blocking symbolic inflation, epistemic overreach, and the ethical hazards associated with uncontained experiential authority.

## IER-overview.md

## 1. What IER Is

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a **physicalist identity theory of experience**.

Its central claim is not explanatory, causal, or emergent, but **ontological**:

> **Experience is identical to a specific organizational and dynamical regime of physical systems.**

That regime is called a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.

IER holds that:

* there is **one objective physical reality**, governed by mind-independent law;
* some physical systems, when organized in a particular way, *are experiential*;
* experience is neither fundamental nor illusory, but **real by identity**.

IER introduces **no new substances, properties, forces, or metaphysical categories**.
