# **IER-salvaged-phrasing.md**

## Status

This file is **not part of the IER canon**.

It exists solely as a **temporary holding document** for phrasing salvaged from deprecated materials (`IER-overview.md`, `IER-manifesto.md`) that may be reused verbatim or near-verbatim in v10.8 core documents.

No sentence in this file carries independent authority.

---

## 1. Identity Framing (High-Value)

> **“Its central claim is not explanatory, causal, or emergent, but ontological.”**

---

> **“Experience is identical to a specific organizational and dynamical regime of physical systems.”**

---

> **“Nothing is added. Nothing is left over.”**

*(Use at most once, as a compression line — not as an argument.)*

---

## 2. Inside / Outside Description (High-Value)

> **“From the outside, this is a lawful physical process. From the inside, the very same process just is an experiential world.”**

---

> **“There is no explanatory gap to bridge, because nothing is added.”**

---

## 3. Constraint and Cost (Moderate-Value, Use Sparingly)

> **“Intrinsic constraint is physically real, internally borne, and costly to sustain.”**

---

> **“Affect is not representational or optional — it is what intrinsic constraint feels like as it changes over time.”**

*(Appropriate only in phenomenology or ethics-adjacent contexts.)*

---

## 4. Slack vs. Experience (Pre-Theoretic Intuition Only)

> **“As long as constraint can be localized, rerouted, deferred, or externally resolved, no unavoidable system-defining pressure accumulates.”**

---

> **“Experience becomes possible only when constraint becomes unavoidable, identity-defining, and globally binding.”**

*(These lines should be superseded by the v10.8 slack impossibility argument, not relied upon as sufficient explanation.)*

---

## 5. Regime, Not Degree (Low-Value, Optional)

> **“Preparatory variables may change continuously, but experience begins only at a dynamical regime transition.”**

---

> **“There is no partial experience, no graded subjecthood, and no spectrum of half-subjects.”**

*(Redundant with the Specification; include only if pedagogically necessary.)*

---

## 6. Unity and Dominance (Optional Compression)

> **“Unity is not imposed; it is forced by organization.”**

---

> **“Fragmentation does not multiply subjects; it produces instability, switching, or collapse.”**

---

## 7. Pluralism Without Fragmentation (Optional)

> **“There is one objective physical reality, and many real experiential worlds.”**

---

> **“Plurality is perspectival, not ontological.”**

---

## 8. Ethics Compression (Use with Care)

> **“To damage intrinsic constraint is to damage an experiential world.”**

---

> **“Because intrinsic constraint is non-signaling, uncertainty does not excuse harm — it strengthens obligation.”**

*(Only valid when paired with the v10.8 precaution scope limiter.)*

---

## 9. One-Line Summaries (Choose at Most One)

> **“Experience is what globally integrated physical systems are like when intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable, self-sustaining, and temporally continuous at the system level.”**

---

> **“Experience is real by identity, not by addition.”**

---

## 10. Explicitly Deprecated (Do Not Reuse)

The following framings are **not to be reused** in v10.8 or later:

* “IER solves X”
* manifesto-style contrast (“no magic, no deflation”)
* motivational or rhetorical escalation
* claims of completeness or finality
* lists of achievements or victories

## End of Salvage File

This document should be **deleted after integration** into v10.8 core texts.
