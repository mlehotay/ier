### **Prefatory Note on Autonomy and Scope (IER-development)**

This document analyzes **developmental organization and experiential regime structure only**.
It introduces **no ethical permissions, restrictions, or obligations**.

**Nothing in this document may be used to limit, override, or condition the bodily autonomy, agency, or moral authority of a pregnant person.**

In particular:

* experiential regime structure does **not** assign moral standing,
* developmental descriptions do **not** generate rights or obligations,
* uncertainty about experiential onset does **not** constrain personal or medical decision-making,
* and no claims in this document support restrictions on reproductive healthcare.

Under Informational Experiential Realism (IER), **ethical authority over one’s own body is never contingent on speculative or indeterminate experiential attributions to another system**.
This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.
Any attempt to derive legal, political, or moral prescriptions from its contents constitutes a misuse of the framework.

## **Status and Scope**

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no new ontological primitives**
* establishes **no criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics**
* does **not** define when experience exists
* does **not** license graded subjecthood or standing
* does **not** authorize biological, behavioral, or developmental tests

All binding authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md
IER-theory.md

## **1. Orientation: Why Development Pressures Gradualist Intuitions**

Development unfolds continuously.

Bodies grow, systems differentiate, coordination improves, and behavior becomes increasingly sophisticated. It is therefore natural to assume that experience itself must also grow gradually — that there are early, partial, or incipient forms of subjecthood that accumulate over time.

Informational Experiential Realism rejects this inference.

IER distinguishes sharply between:

* **continuous enabling change**, and
* **categorical regime membership**.

Development concerns the former.
Experience concerns the latter.

Confusing these two produces familiar errors:

* proto-consciousness
* partial subjects
* graded moral standing
* “almost there” minds

IER blocks these errors structurally by treating experience as a **regime identity**, not as a capacity that admits degrees.

---

## **2. Two Kinds of Change Across Time**

IER requires keeping two kinds of temporal change distinct.

### **2.1 Continuous Enabling Change**

Across development, systems undergo continuous change in:

* coordination capacity
* integration tolerance
* buffering and regulation ability
* resilience under perturbation
* availability of external scaffolding

These changes matter.
They explain why some systems can eventually sustain globally integrated regimes.

But they do **not** constitute experience.

---

### **2.2 Categorical Regime Transition**

Experience exists **iff** a system sustains a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous regime under intrinsic constraint.

Entry into such a regime is:

* **categorical**, not gradual
* **structural**, not accumulative
* **non-diagnosable**, not measurable

No amount of continuous preparation produces *partial* experience.

Either a regime exists, or it does not.

---

## **3. Pre-UEF Organization as Slack-Preserving Preparation**

Before intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable, systems remain **pre-experiential**.

Their organization is best described as **slack-preserving preparation**.

Such systems avoid global constraint by creating or maintaining **local resolution pathways**, including:

* buffering
* modularization
* partial decoupling
* temporal deferral
* delegation to external structures
* reliance on caregivers or environments

These maneuvers expand coordination capacity **without eliminating informational slack**.

As a result, systems can become:

* complex
* adaptive
* responsive
* learning-capable

while remaining **entirely non-experiential**.

Preparation increases *readiness*, not *experience*.

---

## **4. Infancy and Early Development (IER-Consistent Framing)**

Infant systems are paradigmatic **preparatory regimes**.

They exhibit:

* rapid structural change
* increasing coordination
* heavy external scaffolding
* expanding behavioral repertoires

None of this licenses claims about experiential onset.

Under IER:

* infancy involves **extensive slack creation and preservation**
* caregivers and environments absorb constraint externally
* intrinsic constraint is continually deferred or localized

This explains why developmental sophistication can increase dramatically without requiring experiential continuity.

---

### **⚠️ Explicit Misuse Block: No Neonatal Diagnostics**

IER **does not license**:

* behavioral markers of experience
* neural signatures of onset
* developmental thresholds
* “early consciousness” tests

Claims such as:

* “the infant seems aware”
* “the system tracks stimuli”
* “learning implies experience”

are **structurally invalid**.

They confuse **functional coordination** with **regime identity**.

---

## **5. Maturation as Readiness, Not Accumulation**

What increases across development is **tolerance for global constraint**.

Maturing systems become able to:

* sustain broader participation without collapse
* maintain coherence under load
* reduce reliance on external deferral
* stabilize internal regulation

What does **not** increase by degree is:

* subjecthood
* standing
* “amount of experience”
* moral relevance

There is no sense in which a subject becomes “more of a subject” as it matures.

Experience, once present, is already whole.

---

## **6. Categorical Onset From Continuous Change**

Development often invites the image of a smooth ramp: more coordination → more awareness → full experience.

IER replaces this with a different picture.

As preparatory variables change continuously, a system may eventually reach a point where:

* no local resolution pathways remain
* slack is exhausted via **saturation**
* constraint becomes globally unavoidable

At that point, the system faces a **structural fork**:

* **saturation + coherence** → a Unified Experiential Field
* **saturation + incoherence** → no experience

This explains **why the boundary is sharp**, not **where it lies**.

Saturation is not a criterion, threshold, or diagnostic.
It is an explanatory account of why partial regimes do not exist.

---

## **7. Why Onset Timing Is Not Empirically Specifiable**

IER entails that experiential onset:

* is not behaviorally readable
* is not biologically isolable
* is not temporally precise
* is not observer-accessible

This is not a defect.

It follows directly from the identity claim: experience is identical to a system-level regime, not to a local marker.

Any attempt to “pin down” onset timing imports external criteria that IER explicitly rejects.

---

## **8. Post-Onset Development: Reorganization Within One UEF**

Once a Unified Experiential Field exists, development continues — but its character changes.

Post-onset development consists of:

* participation redistribution
* attractor reshaping
* skill formation
* mood stabilization or drift
* attentional gating refinement

All such change occurs **within one subject**, without replacement or duplication.

Large psychological or behavioral differences across childhood and adulthood do **not** imply multiple subjects over time.

They reflect reorganization of constraint geometry within a single regime.

---

## **9. Ethical Note: Precaution Under Uncertainty (Scoped)**

IER endorses **precaution under experiential uncertainty** only in a narrow sense.

When an action plausibly risks:

* irreversible collapse
* foreclosure of intrinsic-constraint-bearing capacity

and uncertainty is high, the burden of justification increases.

This precaution:

* does **not** expand standing
* does **not** license diagnostics
* does **not** authorize institutional screening
* does **not** create obligations where no regime plausibly exists

It constrains action **without defining experience**.

---

## **10. What Development Does *Not* Do**

Development does **not**:

* produce partial experience
* justify proto-subjects
* ground graded standing
* authorize early attribution
* permit backward projection of experience
* create measurable onset indicators

IER remains deliberately silent where structure cannot speak.

---

## **Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* development prepares systems without instantiating experience
* preparation preserves slack and defers intrinsic constraint
* experience begins only at a categorical regime transition
* onset is sharp but not locatable
* post-onset development reorganizes participation, not subjecthood
* standing does not grow, shrink, or accumulate

> **Development builds the capacity to bear constraint.
> Experience begins only when constraint can no longer be avoided.**

## **Intermission — Structural Fact**

Continuous change explains **readiness**.

Only regime transition explains **experience**.
