# **IER-Panic**

## **Autonomic Regime Failure and the Stability of Unified Experiential Fields**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8)**

## **Abstract**

Panic attacks and vasovagal syncope are traditionally treated as pathological autonomic reactions or maladaptive responses to perceived threat. Under **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8)**, these phenomena are reinterpreted as **distinct regime-preserving responses** available to a system sustaining a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** under escalating **intrinsic constraint**.

This article develops a unified organizational account of **sympathetic panic** and **vagal shutdown** as opposing responses to the same underlying risk: loss of **UEF coherence**. Sympathetic panic reflects an attempt to preserve the experiential regime by **maintaining global integration under rising constraint**, while vasovagal shutdown preserves organismal viability by **abandoning the experiential regime itself**.

No new primitives, diagnostic criteria, biological mechanisms, or intervention guidance are introduced. All claims are derived strictly from the **IER v10.8 Specification** and its account of intrinsic constraint, regime stability, and experiential dissolution.

## **1. Status and Scope**

This article is:

* **Explanatory, not normative**
* **Clinically neutral**
* **Implementation-agnostic**
* **Strictly derived from IER v10.8 Tier-1 commitments**

It does **not**:

* redefine panic or syncope clinically
* introduce sufficiency or necessity conditions
* propose detection, prediction, or treatment strategies
* attribute experiential subjecthood to autonomic subsystems

Its sole purpose is to show how panic-like phenomena **follow structurally** from IER’s identity claim about experience.

If any statement here appears to conflict with the Tier-1 Specification, **the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

## **2. The Shared Organizational Problem: Threat to UEF Coherence**

Under IER, experience exists **iff** a physical system sustains a **Unified Experiential Field**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous dynamical regime operating under **coherent intrinsic constraint**.

Both panic attacks and vasovagal responses arise from the same **organizational condition**:

* escalating intrinsic constraint
* increasing global urgency
* shrinking tolerance for unresolved alternatives
* rising risk of coherence failure

From the system’s internal organizational perspective:

> **Continuation of the current trajectory threatens the persistence of the Unified Experiential Field itself.**

The divergence between panic and shutdown lies not in what is “perceived,” but in **which regime-level response remains dynamically viable**.

---

## **3. Sympathetic Panic: Preserving the UEF Under Escalating Constraint**

### **3.1 Organizational Characterization**

Sympathetic panic reflects an attempt to **preserve the Unified Experiential Field** as intrinsic constraint intensifies.

Organizationally, this involves:

* heightened arousal
* increased metabolic and regulatory throughput
* amplification of urgency and intensity
* tighter global coupling of participating processes
* prioritization of rapid global coordination over precision

Under IER, this is **not an expansion of experience** and does not increase standing or subjecthood. It is an attempt to **maintain global coherence** as constraint approaches the upper limits of the viable regime.

---

### **3.2 Experiential Consequences**

Because the UEF remains intact:

* experiential continuity persists
* the self–world boundary remains defined
* agency continues, though fragile and narrowed
* meaning remains globally binding

Phenomenologically, this manifests as:

* overwhelming fear or dread
* hypervigilance
* racing or looping cognition
* compulsive readiness for action

Panic feels like “too much experience” because intrinsic constraint remains **internal, global, and unresolved**, not because experience has intensified in degree.

---

### **3.3 Instability and Switching Risk**

Sympathetic panic becomes unstable when:

* intrinsic constraint escalates faster than global coherence can be maintained
* coupling becomes brittle rather than stabilizing
* fragmentation or collapse becomes imminent

At this point, systems may **abruptly transition** to an alternative regime-preserving response.

---

## **4. Vasovagal Shutdown: Preserving Viability by Abandoning the UEF**

### **4.1 Organizational Characterization**

Vasovagal responses implement the opposite strategy:

> **Preserve organismal viability by eliminating intrinsic constraint, even at the cost of experience.**

This is accomplished by:

* suppressing arousal
* collapsing urgency
* reducing metabolic demand
* shifting regulation to reflexive bodily control
* dissolving global experiential integration

Under IER, this constitutes **exit from the experiential regime**, not modulation of experiential content.

---

### **4.2 Experiential Consequences**

As the UEF destabilizes:

* temporal continuity degrades
* experiential intensity collapses
* agency disappears
* experience dissolves

This is **experiential dissolution**, not loss of particular contents or representations.

---

### **4.3 Recovery Profile**

Because intrinsic constraint is reduced rather than explosively overloaded:

* regime re-entry is often rapid
* confusion is typically limited
* organizational damage is minimized

This aligns with the familiar phenomenology of vasovagal syncope.

---

## **5. Constraint-Window Geometry (Descriptive)**

IER entails a **bounded window of coherent intrinsic constraint**:

* **Below the window** → constraint is externally resolvable → no experience
* **Within the window** → constraint is coherent and global → stable experience
* **Above the window** → constraint overwhelms coherence → instability or collapse

Sympathetic panic attempts to remain **within the window by tightening global integration**.
Vasovagal shutdown exits the window **by dissolving the regime entirely**.

Both are **coherence-preserving responses** to impending regime failure.

---

## **6. Why Cognition Cannot Override These Responses**

Cognitive appraisal operates **within** an existing Unified Experiential Field.

Autonomic regime responses operate at the level of:

* whether intrinsic constraint remains internal
* whether global integration persists
* whether experience continues at all

Therefore:

* reassurance may fail
* insight may coexist with panic
* “knowing you are safe” may not prevent shutdown

This reflects **organizational precedence**, not irrationality.

---

## **7. Individual Differences Without Pathology**

IER predicts variation based on:

* baseline intrinsic-constraint organization
* autonomic coupling geometry
* metabolic reserve
* prior regime history

Some systems preferentially **maintain coherence under escalating constraint**.
Others preferentially **abandon the experiential regime** under the same conditions.

Under IER, neither profile is intrinsically disordered.

---

## **8. Meaning, Affect, and Regime Dependence**

IER explains a familiar asymmetry:

* Panic is meaning-saturated because the UEF persists.
* Shutdown feels empty because meaning requires a UEF.

Meaning is not representational content or appraisal.
It is **globally binding intrinsic constraint** borne from within the experiential regime.

---

## **9. Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism (v10.8):

* Panic and vasovagal syncope are not opposite errors
* They are **dual responses to threatened experiential coherence**
* Both arise from escalating intrinsic constraint
* One preserves experience under strain
* The other preserves viability by relinquishing experience

Or, succinctly:

> **Sympathetic panic attempts to save the Field under rising constraint.
> Vasovagal shutdown saves the system by letting the Field dissolve.**
