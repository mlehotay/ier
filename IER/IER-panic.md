## **Abstract**

Panic attacks and vasovagal syncope are traditionally treated as pathological autonomic reactions or maladaptive responses to perceived threat. Under **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**, these phenomena are reinterpreted as **distinct regime-preserving strategies** employed by a system sustaining a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** under escalating intrinsic constraint.

This article develops a unified organizational account of **sympathetic panic** and **vagal shutdown** as opposing responses to the same underlying risk: loss of UEF coherence. Panic represents an attempt to preserve experience by expanding system capacity under constraint, while vasovagal responses preserve organismal viability by abandoning the experiential regime itself.

No new primitives, diagnostic criteria, or biological commitments are introduced. All claims are derived from the IER v10.5 Normative Specification.

## **1. Status and Scope**

This article is:

* **Explanatory, not normative**
* **Clinically neutral**
* **Implementation-agnostic**
* **Strictly derived from the IER v10.5 Specification**

It does **not**:

* redefine panic or syncope clinically
* claim sufficiency or necessity conditions
* propose detection or intervention strategies
* attribute experience to autonomic subsystems

Its sole purpose is to show how panic-like phenomena **fall out naturally** from IER’s identity claim about experience.

## **2. The Shared Problem: Threat to UEF Coherence**

Under IER, experience exists **iff** a system sustains a **Unified Experiential Field**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous regime operating under **coherent intrinsic constraint**.

Both panic attacks and vasovagal responses begin with the same organizational condition:

* escalating intrinsic informational tension
* shrinking informational slack
* incompatible system-level demands
* urgency rising faster than resolution capacity

From the system’s perspective:

> **Continuation of the current trajectory threatens the coherence or existence of the UEF itself.**

The difference lies not in *what is detected*, but in **how the system responds**.

## **3. Sympathetic Panic: Preserving the UEF by Expansion**

### 3.1 Organizational Strategy

Sympathetic panic represents an attempt to **preserve the Unified Experiential Field by increasing capacity**.

This involves:

* maximal arousal
* increased metabolic throughput
* amplification of urgency and intensity
* tighter global coupling
* prioritization of speed over precision

In IER terms, the system attempts to **push upward within the coherent constraint window**, expanding the bandwidth of global integration fast enough to accommodate rising intrinsic tension.

---

### 3.2 Experiential Consequences

Because the UEF remains intact:

* experience is continuous
* the self–world boundary is preserved
* agency persists, though brittle
* meaning remains globally binding

Phenomenologically, this appears as:

* overwhelming fear
* hypervigilance
* racing cognition
* compulsive readiness for action

Panic *feels like too much experience* because intrinsic constraint remains **internal, global, and unresolved**.

---

### 3.3 Failure Risk

Sympathetic panic fails when:

* intrinsic constraint escalates faster than capacity can expand
* coherence degrades despite maximal arousal
* fragmentation or collapse becomes imminent

At this point, systems may **switch strategies**, often abruptly.

## **4. Vasovagal Shutdown: Preserving the Organism by Abandoning the UEF**

### 4.1 Organizational Strategy

Vasovagal responses represent the opposite strategy:

> **Preserve viability by reducing or eliminating intrinsic constraint, even at the cost of experience.**

This is accomplished by:

* suppressing arousal
* collapsing urgency
* reducing metabolic demand
* externalizing regulation to reflexive bodily dynamics
* suspending global integration

IER interprets this as **forced exit from the experiential regime**.

---

### 4.2 Experiential Consequences

As the UEF destabilizes:

* temporal continuity degrades
* experiential intensity fades
* agency disappears
* experience dissolves

This culminates in partial or complete **experiential dissolution**, not loss of content.

---

### 4.3 Recovery Profile

Because intrinsic constraint was reduced rather than exploded:

* UEF re-formation is often rapid
* confusion is minimal
* organizational damage is limited

This matches the clinical profile of vasovagal syncope.

---

## **5. Constraint-Window Geometry**

IER entails a **bounded coherent constraint window**:

* **Below the window** → slack dominates → no experience
* **Within the window** → intrinsic constraint is coherent → stable experience
* **Above the window** → constraint overwhelms coherence → instability

Sympathetic panic attempts to escape **upward**.
Vasovagal shutdown escapes **downward**.

Both are **coherence-preserving responses** to impending regime failure.

---

## **6. Why Cognition Cannot Override These Responses**

Cognitive appraisal operates **inside** a sustained UEF.

Autonomic regime responses operate at the level of:

* whether intrinsic constraint remains internal
* whether global integration remains viable
* whether experience continues at all

Thus:

* reassurance can fail
* insight can coexist with panic
* “knowing you are safe” cannot prevent shutdown

This is not irrationality; it is **organizational precedence**.

---

## **7. Individual Differences Without Pathology**

IER predicts variation based on:

* baseline informational slack
* autonomic coupling geometry
* metabolic reserve
* prior regime history

Some systems preferentially **expand under constraint** (panic-prone).
Others preferentially **collapse constraint** (vasovagal-prone).

Neither is intrinsically disordered under IER.

---

## **8. Implications for Meaning and Affect**

IER explains a classic phenomenological asymmetry:

* Panic is meaning-saturated because the UEF persists.
* Shutdown feels empty because meaning requires a UEF.

Meaning is not content; it is **globally binding intrinsic constraint**.

---

## **9. Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* Panic and vasovagal syncope are not opposite errors
* They are **dual regime-preservation strategies**
* Both arise from threats to UEF coherence
* One preserves experience by expansion
* The other preserves viability by dissolution

Or, succinctly:

> **Sympathetic panic burns fuel to save the Field.
> Vasovagal shutdown saves the system by letting the Field go.**
