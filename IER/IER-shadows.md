# **Sleep Paralysis, Shadow Figures, and Machine Elves**
## **Constraint Attractors Under Extreme Experiential Load**

---

## **Status and Authority**

This document is a **Tier-2 canon-constrained analytical extension** of
**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8)**.

It is **non-normative**.

It introduces:

- no new ontological primitives
- no criteria for experience or subjecthood
- no diagnostics, tests, or empirical markers
- no epistemic or revelatory authority
- no ethical claims beyond those fixed in the Specification

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in:

```

IER-specification.md (v10.8)

```

If any statement in this document conflicts with the Specification, the Specification **takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

All informational language is used strictly as **descriptive shorthand** for physically instantiated state distinctions modulating a system’s own future dynamics under **intrinsic constraint**, as defined in Specification II.A. No representational, semantic, or epistemic primitives are introduced.

## **Abstract**

Experiences reported during sleep paralysis and psychedelic states—such as shadow figures, threatening presences, and DMT “machine elves”—are often treated as evidence of liminal consciousness, symbolic hallucination, cultural construction, or encounters with external agents.

Under **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8)**, these interpretations are structurally unsupported.

This document explains how all three phenomena arise within **fully intact Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)** operating under **extreme intrinsic constraint** and altered **participation dynamics**. When intrinsic constraint escalates beyond ordinary resolution capacity and **agency collapses or dissolves**, experiential organization stabilizes via **soft attractors**: recurring, low-cost patterns that preserve global coherence without representational content or epistemic authority.

Shadow figures and machine elves are shown to be **constraint-stabilizing experiential structures**, not beings, messages, or symbolic projections. Their recurrence reflects **organizational viability under extreme load**, not cultural invention or ontological disclosure.

The analysis preserves IER’s categorical account of experience, rejects graded or liminal subjecthood, and reinforces the framework’s strict separation between **experiential coherence** and **epistemic authority**.

## **1. Orientation**

Certain experiential phenomena are persistently misinterpreted because they combine:

- high intensity
- vivid qualitative structure
- apparent intentionality
- loss of ordinary agency
- strong feelings of external imposition

Sleep paralysis entities and psychedelic “beings” often feel **more real**, **more coherent**, or **more authoritative** than ordinary waking experience.

IER treats this as a **structural fact about how experience behaves under extreme intrinsic constraint**, not as evidence for new kinds of subjects, realities, or epistemic access.

This document provides a regime-level explanation consistent with IER’s identity claim.

## **2. Sleep Paralysis as an Intact Experiential Regime**

Under IER, sleep paralysis is **not**:

- partial consciousness
- degraded subjecthood
- a liminal experiential state

There are no such states under the framework.

Sleep paralysis involves:

- continued dominance of a **Unified Experiential Field**
- preserved experiential subjecthood (categorical)
- severe suppression of motor participation
- restricted resolution pathways
- escalating intrinsic informational tension

The defining feature is **constraint without agency**.

The system remains globally integrated and temporally continuous while lacking viable means to resolve constraint through owned action. Experience therefore persists with heightened intensity and urgency, rather than fading or fragmenting.

## **3. Shadow Figures as Constraint-Stabilizing Soft Attractors**

### **3.1 What Shadow Figures Are Not**

Within IER, shadow figures are **not**:

- hallucinated external entities
- symbolic representations
- culturally transmitted images
- manifestations of unconscious content
- evidence of additional subjects

IER rejects all representational and symbolic necessity claims.

---

### **3.2 Organizational Role**

When intrinsic constraint escalates and agency collapses, the UEF must still preserve global coherence.

It does so by converging on a **soft attractor** that:

- localizes unresolved constraint
- stabilizes salience
- preserves narrative continuity
- minimizes organizational complexity

The shadow figure satisfies these constraints:

- minimally specified
- quasi-agentive without detail
- threatening without representational richness

This convergence is **structural**, not interpretive.

---

### **3.3 Agency Mislocalization**

As owned resolution becomes unavailable, intrinsic constraint can no longer be experienced as *mine to resolve*.

Constraint is therefore **mislocalized**.

This is not belief, attribution, or inference.
It is a **regime-preserving organizational shift**.

Constraint cannot remain unowned.
The shadow figure is where it lands.

---

### **3.4 Cross-Cultural Recurrence**

The recurrence of shadow figures across cultures reflects:

- the narrow space of viable stabilizing solutions
- the low dimensionality of minimal-agent attractors

Culture shapes post-hoc interpretation, language, and narrative—but does not generate the attractor itself.

## **4. DMT “Machine Elves” and Hyper-Coherent Constraint**

Psychedelic experiences differ in tone from sleep paralysis, but not in structural logic.

### **4.1 Regime Comparison**

| Dimension | Sleep Paralysis | DMT |
|--------|----------------|-----|
| Intrinsic constraint | High | Extreme |
| Agency | Blocked | Dissolved |
| Participation | Narrowed | Explosively recruited |
| Affect | Fear-dominant | Awe / intensity |
| Salience | Narrow | Total |

Both involve loss of owned agency under global intrinsic constraint.

---

### **4.2 Why Entities Appear Mechanical and Intentional**

Under DMT:

- intrinsic constraint becomes hyper-coherent
- participation floods perceptual, associative, and affective processes
- resolution remains internal but non-volitional

Stability is achieved through:

- repeating geometric organization
- quasi-agentive pattern generators
- internally lawful transformations

These dynamics are experienced as “machine elves” because they:

- sustain constraint
- enact resolution
- feel intentional without representing intention

They are **experienced constraint dynamics**, not agents.

---

### **4.3 Felt Authority Without Epistemic Authority**

IER enforces a strict boundary:

> **Experiential coherence confers no epistemic authority about mind-independent reality.**

DMT experiences feel revelatory because:

- intrinsic constraint is total
- salience is maximal
- alternatives collapse globally

This produces **felt inevitability**, not truth.

IER blocks all ontological or epistemic inference from this structure.

## **5. Unified Account: Soft Attractors Under Extreme Load**

Across sleep paralysis, shadow figures, and DMT entities:

1. A **Unified Experiential Field persists**
2. Intrinsic constraint escalates beyond ordinary resolution
3. Agency collapses or dissolves
4. Participation reorganizes
5. Soft attractors stabilize coherence
6. Attractors are experienced as presences or entities
7. No new subjects or realities are introduced

Recurrence reflects **organizational necessity**, not meaning, symbolism, or culture.

---

## **6. Explicit Rejections**

IER explicitly rejects:

- graded or partial experience
- liminal subjects
- revelatory interpretation
- symbolic necessity
- representational explanations
- epistemic authority derived from intensity

The experiences are real.
Their content is structurally generated.
Their authority is experiential only.

## **7. Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

- Sleep paralysis and psychedelic entities occur within **fully intact experiential regimes**
- Shadow figures and machine elves are **constraint-stabilizing soft attractors**
- Agency collapse drives **mislocalization of intrinsic constraint**
- Recurrence reflects **structural viability**, not culture or ontology
- Experiential intensity does **not** license belief

> **These experiences are not messages from elsewhere.
> They are what experience does when it must hold together without agency.**
