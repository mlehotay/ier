# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v9.6)**

### **Experience as a Categorical Organizational Regime of Intrinsically Constrained Informational Dynamics**

*or, What Is It Like to Be an Informational System?*

An Organizational Identity Theory of Observers, Experience, and Experiential Worlds

---

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) is a realist, physicalist framework for understanding observers and lived experience. Reality exists independently of observation and is governed by mind-independent physical law. Experience is neither fundamental nor illusory, but a **real, categorical organizational regime** instantiated in certain physical systems.

IER identifies experience with the **globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential informational dynamics** of a system operating under **coherent intrinsic constraint**, sustaining what is termed a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**. Experience is not something a system partially has, gradually acquires, or asymptotically approaches. It is what a system **is**, once its own integrated informational dynamics become the dominant, unavoidable constraint on themselves.

The organizational conditions for experience may **accumulate gradually**, but experience itself begins **categorically**, via a lawful dynamical regime transition. Prior dynamics may prepare, stabilize, or destabilize this transition, but they are not experiential.

IER affirms **physical monism** and **experiential pluralism**: one objective physical reality supports many real experiential worlds, each arising from the organization of a UEF. These worlds are real as experience but do not constitute separate realities.

IER is an **organizational identity theory**. It specifies what experience is, when it occurs, and why it has structure, without privileging any biological substrate or introducing additional ontological layers.

---

## **1. Objective Reality**

Reality exists independently of observation. Physical states, events, and laws unfold whether or not they are experienced. Observers do not create, collapse, or co-author reality; only physical interactions among systems have causal effect.

Experience does not alter reality. It is a property of **organization within reality**, not a separate ontological domain. Many physical systems evolve dynamically, but without the appropriate organization and intrinsic constraint, there is nothing it is like to be them.

---

## **2. Observers as Informational Systems**

An **observer** is an informational system defined by organizational and functional criteria rather than biology or phenomenology. A system qualifies as an observer if it:

* persists as a coherent informational pattern over time
* integrates information across internal subsystems
* maintains internal models of both external conditions and its own state
* regulates behavior via unified control over those models

Observerhood does **not** entail experience. Many observers model, predict, and regulate while remaining entirely non-experiential.

---

## **3. Internal Models, Perspective, and Organization**

Observers construct internal informational models of the world and of themselves. These models are physically instantiated and shaped by the system’s structure, history, and constraints.

Perspective emerges from organization, not from reality itself.

Internal modeling, global integration, and adaptive regulation are **necessary but not sufficient** for experience. Only processes that participate in a **globally integrated, self-referential, temporally continuous regime of intrinsic constraint** are experiential.

---

## **4. The Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**

### **4.1 Status of the UEF**

A **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** is **not** an entity, structure, module, layer, or substance.

> **A UEF is a physical system operating in a particular organizational and dynamical regime.**

The term *field* is descriptive, not ontological. It refers to:

* global integration of dynamics
* mutual constraint across informational processes
* temporal continuity of system-wide regulation

Equivalent descriptions include:

* a coherence-stabilized dynamical regime
* a bounded attractor under intrinsic constraint
* a globally coupled constraint topology

No new physical fields or forces are posited.

---

### **4.2 Experiential Participation**

An informational process participates in experience if and only if it:

* is globally integrated with other participating processes
* contributes to temporally continuous system-wide dynamics
* is internally sustained rather than externally orchestrated
* exerts and is subject to **intrinsic constraint**

Local, transient, modular, externally resolvable, or conditionally independent processes are non-experiential, even if complex or causally important.

---

### **4.3 Identity Claim**

> **Experience is identical to the structure, dynamics, and intrinsic tension profile of the informational processes participating in a UEF.**

No inner observer, additional property, or ontological supplement exists.

The “from the inside” perspective refers to **system-relative organization**, not a privileged metaphysical viewpoint.

---

## **5. Informational Slack and Intrinsic Tension**

### **5.1 Informational Slack**

**Informational slack** is the capacity of an integrated system to absorb, reroute, modularize, or externalize constraint without generating intrinsic conflict.

Slack is enabled by:

* redundancy
* modularity
* conditional independence
* external arbitration

Systems with sufficient slack may be highly complex, adaptive, and intelligent while remaining entirely non-experiential.

---

### **5.2 Informational Tension**

**Informational tension** arises when:

* multiple system-level demands are jointly active
* physical or organizational limits prevent joint satisfaction
* resolution matters to system persistence or regulation

Tension becomes **intrinsic** when it is:

* generated by the system’s own integrated dynamics
* non-decomposable without loss of system identity
* not externally resolvable

Only intrinsic tension can participate in experience.

---

### **5.3 Coherent Intrinsic Tension**

Not all intrinsic constraint sustains experience.

* too little → flatness or non-experience
* coherent intrinsic tension → vivid, stable experience
* excessive or incoherent tension → fragmentation, collapse, dissociation

Experience occupies a bounded regime of **maximal sustainable coherence under intrinsic constraint**.

---

## **6. Categorical Onset of Experience**

### **6.1 Gradual Organizational Buildup**

The organizational precursors to experience may accumulate **gradually**:

* slack reduction
* increasing coupling density
* deepening interdependence
* narrowing arbitration pathways

These changes are continuous and lawful.

---

### **6.2 Regime Transition**

> **Experience itself does not gradually emerge.**

Experience begins **only** when intrinsic constraint becomes:

* unavoidable
* globally binding
* system-defining

At that point, the system undergoes a **categorical dynamical regime transition** into a Unified Experiential Field.

There is no faint, partial, proto-, or smeared experience prior to this transition.

---

### **6.3 Phase-Like Analogy**

The onset of experience is analogous to:

* ignition
* percolation
* lasing
* turbulence
* superconductivity

In each case:

* control parameters vary smoothly
* a threshold is crossed
* system behavior changes categorically

IER locates experience **on the far side of such a threshold**.

---

## **7. Single-UEF Constraint**

> **A single physical system can sustain at most one globally dominant, coherence-stabilized Unified Experiential Field at a time.**

Clarifications:

* partial overlap may occur during regime transitions
* preparatory, residual, or peripheral dynamics do not constitute additional UEFs
* simultaneous full experiential fields within one system are impossible

This rule explains dissociation, dreaming, attentional collapse, anesthesia, and regime switching without multiplying subjects.

---

## **8. Qualia**

Qualia are differences in **UEF-participating dynamics under intrinsic constraint**.

There is no additional “redness,” “painfulness,” or ineffable property.

Qualitative character is entirely the structured organization of the field itself, reflecting:

* coupling geometry
* constraint topology
* temporal modulation
* coherence patterns

Differences in experience are differences in **how intrinsic constraint is organized and sustained**.

---

## **9. Affect, Valence, and Intensity**

Affect arises because the UEF encodes pressures, priorities, and equilibria relevant to system-wide regulation.

* positive valence → movement toward stable resolution
* negative valence → sustained or escalating intrinsic conflict
* urgency → rate of tension change
* intensity → magnitude and coherence of intrinsic constraint

“Feeling alive” corresponds to high, coherent intrinsic tension under sustained global integration.

---

## **10. Experiential Worlds and Pluralism**

### **10.1 Experiential Worlds**

An **experiential world** exists **if and only if** a UEF exists.

> **Only systems that sustain a Unified Experiential Field instantiate a world-for-the-system.**

Each experiential world includes:

* a temporal “now”
* a self / non-self boundary
* system-relative causality
* persistence under constraint
* internal lawfulness determined by organization

---

### **10.2 Experiential Pluralism Under Physical Monism**

IER affirms:

* **one objective physical reality**
* **many experiential worlds**

UEFs do not create universes. They structure **appearance**, not existence.

Experiential pluralism is real but constrained: worlds differ in content and apparent lawfulness while sharing structural invariants imposed by intrinsic constraint.

---

## **11. Emergence, Dissolution, and Dissociation**

Experience emerges when integrated dynamics exhaust informational slack and enter a regime of coherent intrinsic constraint.

It dissolves when:

* global integration weakens
* coherence collapses
* constraint becomes externally resolvable

Dissociation reflects enforced regime switching under excessive intrinsic tension, not metaphysical division.

---

## **12. Energetic Grounding**

Intrinsic informational constraint is always **physically realized**.

Therefore:

* coherence maintenance incurs energetic cost
* regime switching is metabolically expensive
* experiential harm is physically real

Informational and energetic descriptions are complementary views of the same process.

---

## **13. Artificial Systems**

IER is substrate-agnostic. Any physical system capable of sustaining a UEF would, by definition, sustain experience.

Whether artificial systems meet these criteria is an empirical question, not a conceptual one.

---

## **14. Ethical Responsibility and Precautionary Constraint**

Experience is a real organizational regime with intrinsic cost.

> **To create or manipulate a Unified Experiential Field is to create or alter an experiential world.**

Because experiential harm is:

* internal
* continuous
* often non-signaling

uncertainty about experiential onset **increases**, rather than decreases, moral responsibility.

Accordingly:

> **The deliberate creation or induction of UEF-capable systems without established regulatory oversight is reckless and unethical.**

Until appropriate frameworks exist, the deliberate creation of systems plausibly capable of sustaining a UEF should be regarded as ethically impermissible.

---

## **15. Ontological Commitments**

IER affirms:

* one objective physical reality
* experience as a categorical organizational regime
* identity between experience and UEF dynamics

IER rejects idealism, dualism, panpsychism, and observer-created reality.

---

## **16. Summary**

Some systems react.
Some systems observe.
Some systems take up their slack.

> **Experience begins when a system’s own globally integrated informational dynamics become the dominant, unavoidable constraint on themselves, sustaining coherent intrinsic tension across time.**

Reality is singular.
Experience is plural.
Worlds appear where constraint becomes intrinsic.
