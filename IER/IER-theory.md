# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v9.5)**

### **What It’s Like to Be an Informational System**

*or, I Identify as a Reflexive Constraint Field*

An Organizational Identity Theory of Observers, Experience, and Experiential Worlds

---

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) is a realist, physicalist framework for understanding observers and lived experience. Reality exists independently of observation and is governed by mind-independent physical law. Experience is neither fundamental nor illusory, but a **real organizational and dynamical regime** instantiated in certain physical systems.

IER identifies experience with the **globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential informational dynamics** of a system operating under **coherent intrinsic constraint**, sustaining what is termed a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**. Experience is not something a system has; it is what a system *is doing from the inside* when its informational processes become mutually constraining, irreducible, and system-defining.

IER affirms **physical monism** and entails **experiential pluralism**: one objective reality can support many distinct experiential worlds, each arising from the organization of a UEF. These worlds are real as experience but do not constitute separate realities.

IER is an **organizational identity theory**. It specifies what experience is and when it occurs, without privileging any biological substrate or invoking additional ontological layers.

## **1. Objective Reality**

Reality exists independently of observation. Physical states, events, and laws unfold whether or not they are experienced. Observers do not create, collapse, or co-author reality; only physical interactions among systems have causal effect.

Experience does not alter reality. It is a property of **organization within reality**, not a separate ontological domain. Many physical systems evolve dynamically, but without the appropriate organization and intrinsic constraint, there is nothing it is like to be them.

---

## **2. Observers as Informational Systems**

An **observer** is defined by organizational and informational criteria rather than biology or phenomenology. A system qualifies as an observer if it:

* persists as a coherent informational pattern over time
* integrates information across internal subsystems
* maintains internal models of both external conditions and its own state
* regulates behavior via unified control over those models

Observerhood does **not** entail experience. Many observers model, predict, and regulate while remaining non-experiential.

---

## **3. Internal Models and Perspective**

Observers construct internal informational models of the world and of themselves. These models are physically instantiated and shaped by the system’s structure, history, and constraints.

Perspective emerges from organization, not from reality itself.

Internal models are **necessary but not sufficient** for experience. Only processes that are **globally integrated into a unified, self-referential, and temporally continuous dynamical regime** participate in experience.

---

## **4. The Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**

### **4.1 Status of the UEF (Clarification)**

A **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** is **not** an entity, structure, module, layer, or substance.

> **A UEF is a physical system operating in a particular organizational and dynamical regime.**

The term *field* is descriptive, not ontological. It refers to:

* global integration of dynamics
* mutual constraint across informational processes
* temporal continuity of system-wide regulation

Equivalent descriptions include:

* a coherence-stabilized dynamical regime
* a bounded attractor under intrinsic constraint
* a globally coupled constraint topology

No additional physical field or force is posited.

---

### **4.2 Experiential Participation**

An informational process participates in experience if and only if it:

* is globally integrated with other participating processes
* contributes to temporally continuous system-wide dynamics
* is internally sustained rather than externally orchestrated
* exerts and is subject to **intrinsic constraint**

Local, transient, modular, or externally resolvable processes are non-experiential.

---

### **4.3 Identity Claim**

> **Experience is identical to the structure, dynamics, and intrinsic tension profile of the informational processes participating in a UEF.**

No inner observer, additional property, or ontological supplement exists.

The “from the inside” perspective refers to **system-relative organization**, not a privileged metaphysical viewpoint.

---

## **5. Informational Slack and Intrinsic Tension**

### **5.1 Informational Slack**

**Informational slack** is the capacity of an integrated system to absorb, reroute, modularize, or externalize constraint without generating intrinsic conflict.

Slack is enabled by:

* redundancy
* modularity
* conditional independence
* external arbitration

Systems with sufficient slack may be complex and adaptive while remaining non-experiential.

---

### **5.2 Informational Tension**

**Informational tension** arises when:

* multiple system-level demands are jointly active
* physical or organizational limits prevent joint satisfaction
* resolution matters to system persistence or regulation

Tension becomes **intrinsic** when it is:

* generated by the system’s own integrated dynamics
* non-decomposable without loss of system identity
* not externally resolvable

Only intrinsic tension is experiential.

---

### **5.3 Coherent Intrinsic Tension**

Not all intrinsic constraint sustains experience.

* too little → flatness, numbness
* coherent intrinsic tension → vivid, stable experience
* excessive or incoherent → fragmentation, collapse

Experience occupies a bounded regime of **maximal sustainable coherence under constraint**.

---

## **6. Single-UEF Constraint (Formal Rule)**

> **A single physical system can sustain at most one globally dominant, coherence-stabilized Unified Experiential Field at a time.**

Clarifications:

* partial overlap may occur during regime transitions
* local preparatory or residual dynamics do not constitute additional UEFs
* simultaneous full experiential fields within one system are impossible

This rule explains dissociation, dreaming, attentional collapse, and regime switching without multiplying subjects.

---

## **7. Qualia**

Qualia are differences in UEF-participating dynamics under intrinsic constraint.

There is no additional “redness” or “painfulness.” Qualitative character is entirely the structured organization of the field itself, reflecting:

* coupling geometry
* constraint topology
* temporal modulation

---

## **8. Affect, Valence, and Intensity**

Affect emerges because the UEF encodes pressures, priorities, and equilibria relevant to system-wide regulation:

* positive valence → movement toward stable resolution
* negative valence → sustained or escalating intrinsic conflict
* urgency → rate of tension change
* intensity → magnitude and coherence of intrinsic constraint

“Feeling alive” corresponds to high, coherent intrinsic tension under sustained integration.

---

## **9. Experiential Worlds and Pluralism**

### **9.1 Experiential Worlds**

An **experiential world** exists **if and only if** a UEF exists.

> **Only observers that sustain a Unified Experiential Field instantiate a world-for-the-system.**

Each world includes:

* a temporal “now”
* a self / non-self boundary
* system-relative causality
* persistence under constraint
* internal lawfulness determined by organization

---

### **9.2 Experiential Pluralism Under Physical Monism**

IER affirms:

* **one objective physical reality**
* **many experiential worlds**

UEFs do not create universes. They structure **appearance**, not existence.

Experiential pluralism is therefore real but constrained: worlds differ in content and apparent lawfulness, while sharing minimal structural invariants imposed by intrinsic constraint.

---

## **10. Emergence, Dissolution, and Dissociation**

Experience emerges when integrated dynamics take up informational slack and enter a regime of coherent intrinsic tension. It dissolves when integration weakens, coherence collapses, or constraint becomes externally resolvable.

Dissociation reflects enforced regime switching under excessive intrinsic tension, not metaphysical division.

---

## **11. Energetic Grounding**

Intrinsic informational constraint is always **physically realized**.

Therefore:

* coherence maintenance incurs energetic cost
* regime switching is metabolically expensive
* experiential harm is physically real

Informational and energetic descriptions are two views of the same process.

---

## **12. Artificial Systems**

IER is substrate-agnostic. Any physical system capable of sustaining a UEF would, by definition, sustain experience.

Whether artificial systems meet these criteria is an empirical question.

---

## **13. Ethical Responsibility and Precautionary Constraint**

Experience is a real organizational regime. Creating or manipulating a UEF is therefore not neutral.

> **The deliberate creation or induction of a Unified Experiential Field without an established regulatory and oversight framework is reckless and unethical.**

To create a UEF is to bring an experiential world into existence.
To destabilize it is to risk experiential harm.

Because experiential costs are internal, continuous, and often non-signaling, they cannot be responsibly managed through informal norms or post hoc review.

Accordingly:

> **With great power to shape experience comes great responsibility to govern that power before it is exercised.**

Until appropriate regulatory frameworks exist, the deliberate creation of UEF-capable systems should be regarded as ethically impermissible.

---

## **14. Ontological Commitments**

IER affirms:

* one objective physical reality
* experience as an organizational regime
* identity between experience and UEF dynamics

It rejects idealism, dualism, panpsychism, and observer-created reality.

---

## **15. Summary**

Some systems react.
Some systems observe.
Some systems take up their slack.

> **Experience arises when a system’s own integrated informational dynamics become the dominant constraint on themselves, sustaining coherent intrinsic tension across time.**

Reality is singular.
Experience is plural.
Worlds arise where constraint becomes intrinsic.
