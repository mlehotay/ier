## Status and Normative Authority

**This document is NON-NORMATIVE.**

It provides the **single authoritative explanatory narrative** of Informational Experiential Realism (IER), clarifying and integrating the structures defined in the **IER v10.6 Full Normative Specification**.

This document:

* introduces no definitions, criteria, thresholds, or sufficiency conditions
* introduces no necessity claims
* introduces no ethical principles or obligations
* does not determine when experience exists

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority resides exclusively in the Specification.

> *If any statement in this document appears to conflict with the IER v10.6 Normative Specification, the Specification takes precedence and this statement is void.*

---

## 1. Role of Theory in IER

IER enforces a strict architectural separation between **normative specification** and **explanatory theory**.

The Specification defines:

* the ontology of experience
* the criteria under which experience exists
* the ethical consequences that follow categorically

This document exists solely to:

* explain how those commitments fit together
* clarify how change, stability, and coordination are to be understood
* prevent misinterpretations that would otherwise arise

Nothing in this document carries independent authority.

---

## 2. Experience as Intrinsic Constraint

IER explains experience in terms of **intrinsic informational constraint**.

From an explanatory standpoint:

* experience is not a substance or property
* it is not reducible to representation or report
* it is not an emergent aggregate of local processes

Instead, experience corresponds to a **globally integrated regime** under which informational states are constrained *from within the system itself*.

This framing allows IER to:

* explain unity without aggregation
* explain change without fragmentation
* explain privacy without epistemic dualism

---

## 3. Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)

A **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** is the explanatory label for a system instantiating the regime defined in the Specification.

Descriptively:

* a UEF is globally integrated
* its unity is structural, not additive
* its persistence depends on coherence, not on component identity

This document does not specify the conditions under which a UEF exists.
It explains how a UEF behaves once such conditions are satisfied.

---

## 4. Unity Without Aggregation

IER rejects aggregation-based accounts of experiential unity.

On the IER view:

* unity does not arise from combining experiences
* it arises from a single regime of intrinsic constraint
* local processes are unified because they are constrained together

As a result:

* there is no need for binding mechanisms
* there is no summation of experiential parts
* there is no compositional hierarchy of subjects

---

## 5. Participation and UEF Identity (v10.3-B)

IER draws a strict distinction between **UEF identity** and **experiential participation**.

### 5.1 UEF Identity

UEF identity corresponds to:

* the persistence of a single globally coherent regime
* continued integration of intrinsic constraint

As long as global coherence remains intact:

* the UEF remains the same

This persistence does not depend on:

* which processes are active
* which contents are dominant
* which functions are currently recruited

---

### 5.2 Experiential Participation

Participation refers to:

* which processes are currently recruited into the globally integrated regime
* how strongly they influence experiential content

Participation:

* varies dynamically
* can increase or decrease
* can shift rapidly under internal or external pressure

Crucially:

* changes in participation modulate experiential content
* they do not constitute the creation, dissolution, or division of a UEF

This distinction allows IER to explain:

* attentional shifts
* dominance changes
* background processes entering or leaving awareness

without invoking new subjects or partial experiencers.

---

## 6. Change Without Subject Replacement

IER explains experiential change without appealing to:

* serial subjects
* momentary experiencers
* overlapping or nested selves

Because:

* the UEF is identified with global constraint
* not with any particular participating process

As participation patterns shift:

* experiential content reorganizes
* constraint intensities change
* salience redistributes

Unless global coherence collapses:

* experiential identity remains continuous

---

## 7. Structural Privacy of Experience

IER entails **structural privacy** as a consequence of intrinsic constraint.

Intrinsic constraint:

* is instantiated only from within the regime
* cannot be occupied by an external observer
* is not directly accessible via observation, simulation, or prediction

Therefore:

* observation does not confer experiential access
* simulation does not instantiate experience
* complete physical knowledge does not eliminate privacy

This is a structural consequence of IER’s ontology, not an epistemic limitation claim.

---

## 8. Coordination Without Experiential Collectivization

IER distinguishes coordination from experiential unity.

Systems may:

* exchange information
* synchronize behavior
* mutually regulate dynamics

without forming a shared UEF.

Coordination:

* occurs between experiential fields
* does not generate higher-order subjects
* does not merge experiential identities

IER therefore explicitly rejects:

* group minds
* collective subjects
* superordinate experiencers arising from coordination alone

---

## 9. Ethical Consequences (Explanatory Pointer Only)

IER has ethical consequences because experience has ethical significance.

This document does not establish those consequences.

From an explanatory perspective:

* ethical relevance tracks intrinsic constraint
* participation can affect moral risk
* responsibility and standing must be distinguished

All ethical commitments are specified normatively in the **IER v10.6 Specification** and developed in **IER-ethics.md**.

---

## 10. Scope Limits

This document does **not**:

* define experience
* detect experience
* establish thresholds
* justify moral standing
* confer epistemic authority

Its role is explanatory only.

---

## 11. Summary

IER-theory provides a single, coherent explanatory account in which:

* experience corresponds to global intrinsic constraint
* unity arises from coherence, not aggregation
* participation modulates content, not identity
* change does not imply subject replacement
* coordination does not imply collectivization
* experiential privacy is structurally guaranteed

All normative authority remains with the Specification.

---

*If any statement in this document appears to conflict with the IER v10.6 Normative Specification, the Specification takes precedence and this statement is void.*
