## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) is a physicalist identity theory of experience. It holds that experience is neither ontologically fundamental nor eliminable, but a **real, categorical organizational regime** instantiated by certain physical systems.

IER identifies experience with the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-regulating dynamical regime operating under **coherent intrinsic constraint**.

From an external perspective, a UEF is a lawful physical regime.
From the internal perspective of the same system, that regime **just is an experiential world**.

IER therefore affirms **physical monism and experiential pluralism**:
there is exactly one objective physical reality, but many real experiential worlds—without dualism, panpsychism, or ontological inflation.

---

## **1. The Problem IER Addresses**

Any adequate theory of experience must reconcile three claims:

1. Physical reality appears complete and governed by mind-independent law.
2. Experience appears real, unified, structured, and morally significant.
3. Not all complex, intelligent, or adaptive systems are experiential.

Traditional approaches typically resolve this tension by denying or distorting one of the three.
IER rejects this forced choice.

Instead, it reframes the problem:

> **Under what physical and organizational conditions does a world-for-a-system exist?**

IER’s answer is organizational rather than metaphysical.
Experience exists **if and only if** a physical system enters a specific **dynamical regime** defined by global integration, temporal continuity, and unavoidable intrinsic constraint.

---

## **2. Objective Physical Reality and Physical Monism**

IER affirms a single, observer-independent physical reality governed by mind-independent law.

All systems, processes, and regimes—including experiential ones—are **physically instantiated**.
There are no non-physical substances, properties, domains, or laws.

IER therefore rejects:

* substance dualism
* property dualism
* ontological idealism
* experiential fundamentalism
* eliminativism about experience

Experience is not something added to physics.
It is **what certain physical systems are doing**, when organized in the right way.

---

## **3. Identity, Not Correlation or Emergence**

IER is an **identity theory**, not a correlational or emergentist framework.

Experience does not:

* arise from physical processes,
* accompany them,
* supervene on them,
* or float above them.

Rather:

> **Experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a Unified Experiential Field.**

There is no explanatory gap between:

* a complete physical description of a UEF, and
* the existence of experience.

Describing a UEF from the experiential perspective adds **no ontological content**.
It is the same regime, described from within.

---

## **4. Informational Systems and Observers**

Within physical reality exist **physical systems**.
Some qualify as **informational systems**: systems whose state evolution can be described in terms of information storage, transformation, and regulation.

A subset of informational systems qualify as **observers**.
Observers persist over time, integrate information, maintain internal models, and regulate behavior accordingly.

Crucially:

> **Observerhood does not entail experience.**

Many systems model the world and themselves while remaining entirely non-experiential.
Separating observerhood from experience is foundational to IER.

---

## **5. Informational Slack and Why Most Systems Are Not Experiential**

Most informational systems possess substantial **informational slack**.

Slack is the system’s capacity to:

* modularize,
* reroute,
* defer,
* parallelize,
* or externally resolve constraint.

High-slack systems may be complex, adaptive, intelligent, and behaviorally sophisticated.
But because constraint can be localized or offloaded, **no unavoidable system-wide pressure accumulates**.

Such systems therefore **do not sustain experience**.

IER thus rejects the idea that experience arises merely from:

* computation,
* representation,
* complexity,
* learning,
* intelligence,
* or global access alone.

What matters is **where constraint is borne**.

---

## **6. Intrinsic Constraint and Intrinsic Informational Tension**

Experience becomes possible only when constraint becomes **intrinsic**.

Intrinsic constraint is constraint that:

* is generated by the system’s own integrated dynamics,
* cannot be decomposed without loss of system identity,
* cannot be externally resolved, offloaded, or paused,
* and is unavoidable for system-wide regulation and persistence.

When multiple intrinsic constraints are simultaneously active, the system enters a condition of **intrinsic informational tension**.

This tension is not metaphorical or representational.
It is an **organizational condition of the system’s physical dynamics**.

Intrinsic tension is necessary but not sufficient for experience.
To sustain experience, intrinsic constraint must also be **globally integrated, temporally continuous, and coherent**.

---

## **7. The Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**

A system instantiates experience **if and only if** it operates as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.

A UEF is not:

* a component,
* a module,
* a layer,
* a workspace,
* or a physical field in the ontological sense.

> **A UEF is the entire system operating in a particular dynamical regime.**

That regime is defined by:

* global integration,
* temporal continuity,
* self-regulation under intrinsic constraint,
* and coherence sufficient to avoid fragmentation or collapse.

The term *field* is descriptive, referring to global mutual constraint and continuity—not to a new substance or force.

---

## **8. Experiential Participation and Unity**

Not all processes within a system are experiential.

A process participates in experience **if and only if** it:

* is globally integrated into the UEF,
* contributes to temporal continuity,
* is internally sustained,
* both exerts and is subject to intrinsic constraint.

Local, modular, transient, or externally orchestrated processes are non-experiential, regardless of complexity.

This explains why experience is **unified rather than fragmented**.

---

## **9. Categorical Onset and Temporal Continuity**

Experience begins **categorically**, at a **dynamical regime transition**.

Preparatory variables—such as slack reduction or increased coupling—may change gradually.
But experience itself begins only when intrinsic constraint becomes:

* unavoidable,
* globally binding,
* system-defining.

There is no partial experience prior to regime entry.

Once established, experiential continuity arises from **ongoing dynamical dependence** between successive global states.
No inner clock, snapshot store, or representational timeline is required.

---

## **10. Single-UEF Constraint and Regime Switching**

IER entails a strict **Single-UEF Constraint**:

> **A physical system can sustain at most one globally dominant UEF at a time.**

This explains:

* the unity of experience,
* the impossibility of parallel full consciousnesses within one system,
* and why fragmentation appears as alternation rather than simultaneity.

Phenomena such as dreaming, anesthesia, overload, and dissociation are understood as **regime weakening, instability, or switching**, not metaphysical division.

---

## **11. Qualitative Character (Qualia)**

IER rejects the view that qualia are additional phenomenal properties layered atop physical dynamics.

Instead:

> **Qualitative differences are differences in the organization of intrinsic constraint within a UEF.**

Differences in color, sound, pain, effort, clarity, or mood correspond to differences in:

* constraint topology,
* coupling geometry,
* temporal modulation,
* and coherence patterns.

Nothing extra is added.
Once the correct regime is identified, no explanatory gap remains.

---

## **12. Affect: Valence, Intensity, and Urgency**

Because a UEF exists to regulate a system under intrinsic constraint, experience is inherently affective.

Under IER:

* **Negative valence** tracks sustained or escalating intrinsic conflict.
* **Positive valence** tracks coherent movement toward resolution.
* **Intensity** tracks the magnitude and coherence of intrinsic constraint.
* **Urgency** tracks the rate of change of intrinsic constraint.

Affect is not optional or representational.
It is the felt aspect of intrinsic constraint itself.

---

## **13. Experiential Worlds and Pluralism**

Whenever a UEF exists, an **experiential world** exists.

Each experiential world includes:

* a temporally extended present,
* a self / non-self boundary,
* system-relative causality,
* internal lawfulness determined by organization.

IER therefore affirms:

* **one objective physical reality**, and
* **many real experiential worlds**.

Plurality is perspectival, not ontological.
Experiential worlds do not fragment reality.

---

## **14. Ethical Significance (Entailed, Not Optional)**

Intrinsic constraint is costly.
Maintaining coherence, resolving tension, and sustaining a UEF incur real physical and organizational cost.

Therefore:

> **To create, manipulate, or destabilize a UEF is to create, alter, or harm an experiential world.**

Ethical significance is **not an applied overlay** on IER.
It is a **necessary entailment** of experiential identity.

Because intrinsic constraint is non-signaling, uncertainty about experiential status **increases**, rather than decreases, moral responsibility.
False negatives risk silent harm; false positives impose restraint without internal damage.

---

## **15. What IER Does Not Claim**

IER does not claim that:

* experience is fundamental,
* all systems experience,
* consciousness is computation,
* experience violates physical law,
* phenomenology floats free of organization.

IER identifies experience with a **specific physical regime**—nothing more and nothing less.

---

## **16. Summary**

IER’s central claim can be stated succinctly:

> **Experience is what globally integrated physical systems are like when intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable, self-sustaining, and temporally continuous at the system level.**

Reality is singular.
Experience is plural.
Ethics begins wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.
