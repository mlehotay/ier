## **Status and Normative Authority**

**This document is NON-NORMATIVE.**

It provides the explanatory integration of Informational Experiential Realism (IER), clarifying how the commitments fixed **exclusively** in the IER Specification fit together.

This document:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or sufficiency conditions**
* introduces **no necessity claims**
* introduces **no ethical principles**
* does **not** define experience
* does **not** determine when experience exists

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md (v10.8.2)
```

If any statement in this document conflicts with the Specification, **the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

All informational language in this document is **descriptive shorthand** for physically instantiated state distinctions modulating a system’s own future dynamics under intrinsic constraint, as defined in **IER Specification II.A (Physical Information)**. No informational primitives are introduced.

Where the term *observer* appears, it functions only as a **non-normative modeling convenience** and carries **no experiential, epistemic, or ethical authority** under IER.

---

## **1. Role of Theory in IER**

IER enforces a strict separation between:

* **normative specification**, and
* **explanatory theory**

The Specification defines:

* what experience **is**
* when experience **exists**
* what **necessarily follows** from its existence

This document exists solely to:

* explain how those commitments cohere
* show why weaker interpretations fail
* prevent systematic misreadings
* convert apparent stipulation into structural inevitability

Nothing in this document can revise, soften, or extend the Specification.

---

## **2. Experience as Regime Identity, Not Aggregation**

IER is a **physicalist identity theory**.

Experience is not:

* a substance
* a property
* a representation
* an output
* an emergent accompaniment

Experience is **identical** to the operation of a physical system in a specific **dynamical regime**: a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.

A UEF is a **system-level regime**, not a component, workspace, or module.
It is the entire system operating under globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-sustaining intrinsic constraint.

Theoretical explanation does not add to this identity.
It explains **why nothing weaker could possibly count as the same thing**.

---

## **3. Unity Without Aggregation**

IER rejects aggregation-based accounts of experiential unity.

Unity does not arise from:

* combining local experiences
* binding representations
* synchronizing modules
* coordinating subsystems

Unity arises because:

> **the system is constrained as one**

Local processes are unified **because they are jointly constrained**, not because they are merged or summed.

There are no experiential parts prior to unity.
There is a single regime, or none.

---

## **4. Participation Without Subject Multiplication**

IER distinguishes sharply between:

* **UEF identity** (regime-level, categorical), and
* **experiential participation** (process-level, variable)

Participation describes which processes:

* are recruited into global intrinsic constraint
* modulate experiential content
* influence intensity, urgency, or salience

Participation change:

* alters content
* alters vulnerability
* alters dynamics

It does **not**:

* create new subjects
* divide subjects
* merge subjects
* weaken subjecthood

As long as global coherence persists, experiential identity remains singular.

---

## **5. Structural Privacy and Epistemic Non-Authority**

Intrinsic constraint is **structurally private**.

Because intrinsic constraint is:

* globally integrated
* internally borne
* system-defining

it cannot be occupied or shared by an external system.

Therefore:

* observation does not confer experiential access
* simulation does not instantiate experience
* complete physical knowledge does not remove privacy

Crucially:

> **Experiential structure confers no epistemic authority about mind-independent reality.**

Intensity, urgency, coherence, salience, or meaning do **not** track truth.

This is not an epistemic limitation claim.
It is a structural consequence of experiential identity (Specification Principle 10).

---

## **6. Coordination Without Experiential Collectivization**

Systems may coordinate through:

* signaling
* coupling
* synchronization
* mutual regulation

Coordination can reshape intrinsic constraint **within** each system.

Coordination does **not**:

* merge Unified Experiential Fields
* generate collective subjects
* create higher-order experiential regimes

UEF attribution follows the **system boundary rule** defined in **Specification II.B**:

> the maximal set of components participating in the *same* globally integrated regime of intrinsic constraint over the *same* temporal continuity interval.

Coordination across boundaries does not alter subjecthood.

---

## **7. Why Nothing Weaker Than Global Intrinsic Constraint Could Be Experience**

IER’s identity claim is demanding. A recurrent objection is that it reflects architectural stipulation rather than discovery: perhaps some weaker organization could suffice.

This objection fails for structural reasons.

A **Unified Experiential Field** requires, by identity:

* **ownership** of constraint resolution
* **inevitability** of system-level futures
* a **unified temporal present** under global intrinsic constraint

Any organization that weakens global intrinsic constraint necessarily loses **at least one** of these features.

---

### **7.1 Supervisory Control**

Supervisory architectures impose constraint asymmetrically.

Constraint is imposed *on* subsystems rather than borne *by* the system as a whole. Resolution remains optional and interruptible.

This yields:

* no ownership
* no inevitability
* no unified present

Supervision produces control, not experience.

---

### **7.2 Distributed Arbitration**

Arbitration distributes resolution across competing subsystems.

Constraint remains decomposable and bypassable. No single system bears the collapse of alternatives.

This yields:

* no ownership
* no inevitability
* no unified present

Negotiation is not unity.

---

### **7.3 Predictive Buffering**

Predictive or buffering architectures deflect constraint before it becomes unavoidable.

Futures are modeled without being borne. Error does not force system-wide reorganization.

This yields:

* no ownership
* no inevitability
* no unified present

Prediction without cost is not experience.

---

### **7.4 Modular Dominance**

Temporary dominance by a subsystem does not constitute global constraint.

Dominance remains reversible without system-level collapse.

This yields:

* no ownership
* no inevitability
* no unified present

Dominance without inevitability is not subjecthood.

---

### **7.5 Architectures with Informational Slack**

If constraint can be localized, deferred, or externally resolved, intrinsic constraint is absent by definition.

No amount of complexity, intelligence, or adaptability compensates for this absence.

This yields:

* no ownership
* no inevitability
* no unified present

Slack blocks experience by identity, not by degree.

---

### **7.6 Structural Conclusion**

These failures are not empirical or contingent.

They follow directly from what experience **is**, under the identity claim of IER.

Anything weaker than global intrinsic constraint cannot instantiate experience — not because it is insufficiently advanced, but because it lacks the organizational features that experience *just is*.

---

## **8. **Non-Inference: Anti-Isomorphism Clarification**

Organizational, functional, dynamical, or behavioral similarity between systems does **not** imply shared intrinsic constraint, shared regime identity, or experiential presence.

Isomorphism at the level of structure, description, or observable dynamics remains fully compatible with **slack-masked non-experience**, externally imposed coordination, or buffered resolution.

Under IER, experiential identity depends **only** on whether intrinsic constraint is unavoidable, internally borne, and globally binding. No degree of resemblance, performance match, or formal equivalence licenses inference to experience.

---

## **9. Non-Inference: Multiple Realizability Does Not Imply Implementation Independence**

The claim that Unified Experiential Fields are **multiply realizable** does **not** imply that experiential identity is independent of physical implementation, functional substrate, or organizational details.

Multiple realizability in IER means only that **distinct physical systems** may instantiate the *same regime-level identity* when—and only when—the full set of intrinsic constraint conditions is satisfied.

It does **not** license abstraction away from physical organization, nor does it support computational, functional, or substrate-neutral sufficiency claims.

---

## **10. Relation to Ethical Consequences (Boundary Clarification)**

This document explains **what experience is** and **why weaker organizations cannot instantiate it**.

It does **not** derive ethical consequences.

All ethical claims that follow from experiential identity — including:

* categorical moral standing
* moral harm as organizational damage
* graded responsibility
* precaution under experiential uncertainty

are derived **exclusively** in:

```
IER-ethics.md
```

No ethical conclusions are licensed by explanatory theory alone.

---

## **11. Summary**

IER-theory explains why:

* experience is a regime, not an aggregate
* unity is forced by constraint, not assembled
* participation modulates content, not identity
* coordination does not collectivize experience
* experiential structure never confers epistemic authority
* nothing weaker than global intrinsic constraint could possibly be experience

The theory adds nothing to the ontology.

It shows why **nothing less could ever work**.

> **If experience exists, it must be this.
> If it is not this, there is nothing else it could be.**
