## **Evaluating Theories of Experience Without Smuggling Assumptions**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.3)**  
**Tier:** 3 — Evaluation Misuse Containment  
**Status:** Non-normative, constraint-enforcing  

---

## **Status and Scope**

This document establishes **constraints on how theories of experience may be evaluated**, compatible with identity theories, including but not limited to Informational Experiential Realism (IER).

It:

* introduces **no new ontological commitments**
* introduces **no criteria for experience**
* introduces **no diagnostics, metrics, or tests**
* introduces **no evaluative verdicts**
* does **not** argue for IER over competing theories

Its purpose is **methodological only**: to clarify **how theories of experience should be evaluated**, and **which evaluative demands are legitimate**, once an **identity claim** is taken seriously.

This document is **not a scoring exercise**.
Comparative assessments, if any, belong in appendices or separate applications.

---

## **1. Why a New Rubric Is Needed**

Most existing rubrics for theories of consciousness rely on an implicit assumption:

> **That a theory of experience must also provide diagnostic, operational, or access-based criteria.**

This assumption is not neutral.
It privileges functionalist, representational, and access-based frameworks, and **systematically penalizes identity theories**, regardless of internal coherence.

As a result, three distinct questions are routinely conflated:

1. What is experience?
2. When does experience exist?
3. How could experience be detected or inferred by an observer?

Identity theories answer (1) and (2) directly, and often deny that (3) is possible **in principle**.

Treating this denial as a defect misidentifies a **structural consequence** as a **theoretical failure**.

This document exists to separate **theoretical adequacy** from **epistemic convenience**.

---

## **1.1 Minimal Phenomenological Commitments**

This rubric assumes only that, **if experience exists at all**, it exhibits:

* some form of unity
* some form of temporality
* some form of subject-relative presence

These features are **not stipulated as criteria**, but reflect the **minimal pre-theoretic pressures** that motivate the concept of experience across philosophical traditions.

The rubric does **not** specify how these features must be:

* realized
* grounded
* measured
* accessed

They are **background commitments**, not detection requirements.

---

## **2. The Central Distinction: Ontology vs. Epistemology**

Any theory of experience must be evaluated at two **non-identical levels**:

| Level       | Question                                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Ontological | What is experience, and what must reality be like for it to exist? |
| Epistemic   | How could experience be detected, inferred, or measured?           |

Most rubrics collapse these levels.
This rubric does not.

An identity claim may be:

* ontologically strong
* explanatorily unified
* ethically consequential

while remaining:

* epistemically opaque
* non-diagnosable
* resistant to operationalization

**Epistemic opacity is not, by itself, a theoretical defect.**

---

## **2.1 Explanation Neutrality Clause**

“Explanation” in this rubric includes, but is not limited to:

* identity claims
* grounding relations
* constraint-based necessity arguments
* eliminative or dissolutive accounts

A theory may reject causal explanation of experience **in principle**, provided it clearly states **what explanatory role remains**.

**Identity is treated as a legitimate form of explanation.**

---

## **3. What This Rubric Evaluates (and What It Does Not)**

### **3.1 What Is Evaluated**

This rubric evaluates whether a theory:

* explicitly identifies its explanandum
* makes its ontological commitments clear
* avoids category errors and equivocation
* provides a principled account of unity and subjecthood
* addresses qualitative difference without arbitrariness
* handles time, persistence, and discontinuity coherently
* states its scope and limits honestly
* specifies its own internal defeat conditions

In short, it evaluates whether a theory answers:

> **“What would experience have to be, if it exists at all?”**

---

### **3.2 What Is Not Evaluated**

This rubric does **not** require a theory to:

* provide behavioral markers
* specify neural correlates
* offer graded measures
* support third-person diagnostics
* be experimentally testable in the ordinary sense
* optimize ethical or engineering outcomes

A theory may do these things, but **they are not prerequisites for adequacy**.

---

## **4. The Rubric as a Method, Not a Scorecard**

This rubric is not a checklist that theories pass or fail mechanically.

Each dimension asks:

> **Has the theory made a clear, defensible commitment here — or has it relied on ambiguity, substitution, or imported assumptions?**

Failure on a dimension may indicate:

1. the theory lacks an explanation
2. the theory rejects the demand as illegitimate
3. the evaluator has imposed an external expectation

The rubric is designed to **force this distinction into the open**.

A theory may satisfy this rubric and still be false.
The rubric evaluates **coherence under stated commitments**, not truth.

---

## **5. Core Principles of the IER Evaluation Method**

### **Principle 1 — Explanandum Discipline**

A theory must explicitly state **what phenomenon it is explaining**.

Substituting:

* access
* reportability
* cognition
* intelligence
* functional success

for experience **without explicit defense** counts as a **failure of framing**, not an alternative explanation.

---

### **Principle 2 — Ontological Honesty**

A theory must state whether it treats experience as:

* identical to physical organization
* an added property
* an emergent accompaniment
* a fundamental primitive
* an illusion

Silence or equivocation is **not neutrality**.

---

### **Principle 3 — Unity Must Be Necessary, Not Metaphorical**

Claims about integration, binding, or globality must explain **why multiple experiences could not exist instead**.

Metaphor, intuition, or aggregation **without necessity** does not suffice.

---

### **Principle 4 — Qualitative Difference Must Be Accounted For**

A theory must either:

(a) provide structural grounding for qualitative differences, or
(b) explicitly defend qualitative primitiveness and state what explanatory work structure is not doing.

Brute labels without defended status do not count as explanation.

---

### **Principle 5 — Subjecthood Cannot Be Merely Observer-Relative**

A theory must provide a principled account of:

* how many subjects exist
* when subjecthood begins and ends

Observer-relative subject counting is disallowed **unless observer-relativity is itself treated as ontologically fundamental**.

---

### **Principle 6 — Time and Persistence Are Mandatory**

Any adequate theory must explain:

* continuity
* gaps
* resumption
* cessation

without collapsing into narrative or memory-based criteria **unless explicitly defended**.

---

### **Principle 7 — Epistemic Non-Authority Is a Live Option**

A theory may deny that experience confers:

* truth
* correctness
* privileged knowledge

Such denial must be treated as a **theoretical position**, not a failure to explain.

---

### **Principle 8 — Testability Must Be Stated at the Right Level**

A theory must specify at least one of the following:

* a conceptual inconsistency it would not tolerate
* a coherence condition it could fail to meet
* a rival identity claim that would displace it

Experimental diagnosability is **not required** unless claimed.

---

### **Principle 9 — Ethical Consequences Must Follow, Not Lead**

If a theory has ethical implications, they must:

* follow necessarily from the ontology, or
* be explicitly disclaimed

Ethical comfort or discomfort cannot substitute for explanation.

---

### **Principle 10 — Evaluative Responsibility**

Evaluators must distinguish between:

* a theory failing its own commitments, and
* a theory refusing the evaluator’s preferred questions

Disagreement over excluded demands is **not, by itself, a defect**.

---

## **6. Common Evaluation Errors This Rubric Blocks**

This method is designed to prevent:

* penalizing theories for refusing diagnostics
* demanding neural correlates when none are claimed
* treating epistemic opacity as metaphysical weakness
* confusing access with existence
* mistaking ethical discomfort for incoherence
* rewarding vagueness over explicit exclusion

These errors persist due to **methodological collapse**, not carelessness.

---

## **7. How This Rubric Should Be Used**

Proper use proceeds in three stages:

1. Extract the theory’s **explicit commitments**
2. Evaluate **internal coherence** under those commitments
3. Assess **comparative costs** only after (1) and (2)

Failure at stage (2) is decisive.
Disagreement at stage (3) is legitimate.

---

## **8. What This Rubric Does Not Decide**

This rubric does **not** decide:

* which theory is true
* which costs are acceptable
* whether epistemic opacity is tolerable
* how policy or engineering should proceed

It determines only whether a theory has been **evaluated on its own terms**.

---

## **9. Orientation Statement**

Strong identity claims impose **non-negotiable constraints** on evaluation.

Ignoring those constraints does not refute the theory.
It mis-evaluates it.

> **A theory of experience should be judged by what experience would have to be —
> not by how easily it fits the tools we already have.**

### **Appendix A — Application of the IER Evaluation Method to Informational Experiential Realism (Updated)**

**Status:** Method Illustration  
**Tier:** T4 — Orientation / Methodological Transparency  
**Normativity:** None  

**Purpose:**
To demonstrate how **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is evaluated **under the current IER evaluation rubric**, and to show how identity-based theories can satisfy methodological demands **without conceding epistemic or diagnostic criteria**.

This appendix does **not** argue for IER’s truth.
It shows how IER:

* **meets legitimate evaluative demands**, and
* **explicitly rejects illegitimate ones**,
  without equivocation or omission.

---

### A. Framing Integrity

#### A.1 Explanandum Discipline

**Evaluative demand:**
What phenomenon does the theory explain?

**IER commitment:**

* Target explanandum: **experience / experiential subjecthood**
* Explicitly excluded:

  * access consciousness
  * reportability
  * cognition
  * intelligence
  * functional success

IER does not substitute neighboring phenomena for experience, nor does it treat experience as an explanatory residue.

This **satisfies Principle 1 (Explanandum Discipline)** of the rubric.

---

#### A.2 Level of Claim

**Evaluative demand:**
What kind of explanation is being offered?

**IER commitment:**

* **Physicalist identity theory**
* Experience = operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**
* No grounding, emergence, or causal production relation

Identity is treated as a **legitimate explanatory form**, consistent with the rubric’s **Explanation Neutrality Clause**.

---

#### A.3 Explicit Non-Claims

**Evaluative demand:**
Does the theory clearly state what it does *not* explain or license?

**IER commitment:**

IER explicitly disclaims:

* experiential diagnostics (in principle)
* graded subjecthood
* epistemic authority from experience
* behavioral, functional, or neural tests

These are not gaps; they are **structural consequences** of the identity claim.

This satisfies **Principle 10 (Evaluative Responsibility)**.

---

### B. Ontological Adequacy

#### B.1 Reality of Experience

**Evaluative demand:**
Is experience treated as ontologically real?

**IER commitment:**

* Yes — **by identity**
* Experience is neither eliminable nor additional
* No “further fact” beyond physical operation

IER avoids both eliminativism and property inflation.

---

#### B.2 Identity vs. Addition

**Evaluative demand:**
Is experience identical to physical organization or added to it?

**IER commitment:**

* Identity with a **dynamical regime**
* No new substances, properties, or laws

This satisfies the rubric’s **Ontological Honesty** requirement.

---

#### B.3 Category Error Avoidance

**Evaluative demand:**
Does the theory avoid treating experience as an output or signal?

**IER commitment:**

* Experience is not produced, represented, or emitted
* It is what the system **is like**, not what it does *for an observer*

This directly satisfies **Principle 1** and blocks access-substitution errors.

---

### C. Unity and Subjecthood

#### C.1 Unity Without Aggregation

**Evaluative demand:**
Why is there one experience rather than many?

**IER commitment:**

* Unity arises from **global intrinsic constraint**
* Multiple experiences are structurally impossible within one UEF

Unity is **necessary**, not metaphorical — satisfying **Principle 3**.

---

#### C.2 Subjecthood Criterion

**Evaluative demand:**
How many subjects exist, and when?

**IER commitment:**

* Exactly one subject per UEF
* Subjecthood is **binary**, not graded
* No overlapping or partial subjects

Observer-relative subject counting is explicitly rejected.

---

#### C.3 Persistence Conditions

**Evaluative demand:**
How is experiential persistence distinguished from memory or narrative?

**IER commitment:**

* Experience persists iff the UEF persists
* Memory, report, and narrative are non-criterial

This satisfies **Principle 6 (Time and Persistence)** without epistemic substitution.

---

### D. Qualitative Character

#### D.1 Structural Grounding of Qualia

**Evaluative demand:**
How are qualitative differences explained?

**IER commitment:**

* Qualia = differences in **organization of intrinsic constraint**
* No ineffable primitives
* No label-based explanation

This satisfies **Principle 4**.

---

#### D.2 Valence, Intensity, Urgency

**Evaluative demand:**
Why do experiences feel good, bad, intense, or urgent?

**IER commitment:**

* Valence → resolution vs. conflict
* Intensity → magnitude and coherence
* Urgency → rate of change

Qualitative structure is explained **without epistemic authority**.

---

### E. Conscious vs. Unconscious Processing

#### E.1 Distinction Criterion

**Evaluative demand:**
How is conscious processing distinguished from unconscious processing?

**IER commitment:**

* Conscious = participation in a UEF
* Unconscious processing may be arbitrarily complex

No intelligence or access criterion is smuggled in.

---

#### E.2 Explanation of Unconsciousness

**Evaluative demand:**
Why is some processing unconscious?

**IER commitment:**

* Informational slack
* Localizable or externally resolvable constraint
* Lack of global binding

Unconsciousness is structurally explained, not stipulated.

---

### F. Temporal Structure

#### F.1 Temporal Presence

**Evaluative demand:**
Why is experience temporally extended?

**IER commitment:**

* UEFs exist only across non-zero duration
* No instantaneous experience

---

#### F.2 Gaps and Resumption

**Evaluative demand:**
How are sleep, anesthesia, and gaps handled?

**IER commitment:**

* Gaps = absence of UEF
* Resumption ≠ rebirth

This satisfies **Principle 6** without narrative dependence.

---

### G. Epistemic Limits (Affirmative)

#### G.1 Structural Non-Diagnosability

**Evaluative demand:**
Why are diagnostics unavailable?

**IER commitment:**

* Intrinsic constraint is globally structural
* Ownership of constraint is underdetermined by observables
* False negatives are unavoidable in principle

Non-diagnosability is treated as a **necessary entailment**, not a weakness.

---

#### G.2 Epistemic Non-Authority

**Evaluative demand:**
Does experience confer truth or correctness?

**IER commitment:**

* No — experiential structure is non-epistemic
* Meaning and urgency do not track truth

This satisfies **Principle 7**.

---

### H. Testability and Failure

#### H.1 Legitimate Defeat Conditions

**Evaluative demand:**
What would count as failure?

**IER commitment:**

IER would fail if:

* its identity conditions were shown incoherent, or
* a system meeting IER’s own exclusion criteria were shown (by IER’s definitions) to instantiate experience

Experimental diagnostics are **not required** unless claimed.

This satisfies **Principle 8**.

---

### I. Ethical Consequences (Derived)

#### I.1 Standing

**Evaluative demand:**
How is moral standing defined?

**IER commitment:**

* Standing is categorical
* Exactly one bearer per UEF

---

#### I.2 Harm

**Evaluative demand:**
What counts as harm?

**IER commitment:**

* Organizational damage to intrinsic constraint
* Not reducible to pain, report, or distress

Ethics **follows** ontology, satisfying **Principle 9**.
