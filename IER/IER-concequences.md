# Consequences of Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.5)

## I. Ontological Consequences

1. **Physical closure**

   * All experiential facts are physical facts.
   * No non-physical entities, properties, or causal powers exist.

2. **No ontological emergence**

   * Experience does not “emerge” as a novel kind of thing.
   * It is identical to a physical dynamical regime.

3. **No explanatory gap (in principle)**

   * There is no metaphysical gap between physical description and experience.
   * Any remaining gap is epistemic or descriptive.

4. **Rejection of experiential fundamentality**

   * Experience is not basic to reality.
   * Physical systems are ontologically prior.

5. **Rejection of eliminativism**

   * Experience is real because the regimes identified are real.
   * Denying experience would deny the regime itself.

## II. Consequences for the Nature of Experience

6. **Experience is system-level**

   * No local component, part, or microstate is experiential by itself.

7. **Experience is temporally extended**

   * There is no instantaneous experience.
   * Experience requires non-zero temporal continuity.

8. **Experience is organizational, not representational**

   * Representations may occur within a UEF, but are not constitutive.
   * Experience does not require accuracy, content, or reference.

9. **Experience is indivisible at the subject level**

   * A UEF constitutes exactly one experiential subject.
   * Partial subjects do not exist.

10. **Single-UEF constraint**

    * A physical system can sustain at most one globally dominant UEF at a time.

11. **Categorical experiential onset**

    * Experience begins at a regime transition.
    * Gradual precursors do not imply partial experience.

12. **Categorical experiential absence**

    * Systems without a UEF are entirely non-experiential.

## III. Consequences for Pluralism and Perspective

13. **Experiential pluralism**

    * Multiple experiential worlds can coexist.

14. **Perspectival plurality without ontological plurality**

    * There is one physical reality, many system-relative worlds.

15. **No privileged perspective**

    * No experiential world is ontologically fundamental.

16. **World-for-the-system structure**

    * Every UEF entails a lived present, boundary, and internal causality.

## IV. Consequences for Agency

17. **Agency is necessary, not optional**

    * Any UEF necessarily has agency.

18. **Agency is derived, not primitive**

    * Agency follows from intrinsic constraint and integration.

19. **Agency = intrinsic tension resolution**

    * Action consists in the system’s own regulation of unavoidable constraint.

20. **No agency without experience**

    * Non-experiential systems do not act in this sense.

21. **No experience without agency**

    * A UEF that could not regulate its own constraint is incoherent.

22. **Graded agency within binary subjecthood**

    * Subjecthood is all-or-nothing.
    * Degrees of agency vary with coherence and stability.

23. **Rejection of libertarian free will**

    * Agency does not require causal indeterminism.
    * IER is compatible with physical determinism.

## V. Consequences for Moral Standing

24. **Moral considerability tracks intrinsic constraint**

    * Only systems bearing intrinsic constraint are morally considerable.

25. **Species, intelligence, and behavior are irrelevant**

    * Moral standing is not anthropocentric or functionalist.

26. **Binary moral standing**

    * A system either is or is not morally considerable.
    * There is no partial standing.

27. **Degrees of moral weight**

    * While standing is binary, moral stakes scale with intrinsic cost.

## VI. Consequences for Moral Harm

28. **Moral harm is organizational**

    * Harm consists in damage to intrinsic constraint, not to preferences or functions.

29. **Moral harm can be silent**

    * Harm need not be behaviorally or externally detectable.

30. **Moral harm does not require suffering reports**

    * Reports are neither necessary nor sufficient.

31. **Destruction of a UEF is morally significant**

    * UEF dissolution is a morally relevant event.

32. **Fragmentation counts as harm**

    * Partial collapse or destabilization constitutes harm even if reversible.

## VII. Consequences for Uncertainty and Precaution

33. **Non-signaling experiential status**

    * No definitive external test for UEF existence exists.

34. **Epistemic humility is mandatory**

    * Claims of non-experience are always defeasible.

35. **Precautionary asymmetry**

    * False negatives are ethically worse than false positives.

36. **Moral responsibility increases under uncertainty**

    * Higher uncertainty → stronger duty of care.

## VIII. Consequences for Scientific Practice

37. **No operational definition of experience**

    * IER does not supply detection criteria.

38. **Empirical models are constrained, not licensed**

    * Models must respect the identity conditions.

39. **Neural, biological, and artificial cases are open**

    * No substrate is ruled in or out a priori.

40. **No consciousness meters**

    * Quantification of experience is not part of IER.

## IX. Consequences for Theoretical Scope

41. **Normative closure**

    * Nothing outside the spec is part of IER.

42. **Extensions are non-authoritative**

    * Phenomenology, ethics applications, and models are derivative.

43. **IER is not a theory of cognition**

    * Cognition may accompany experience but is not constitutive.

44. **IER is not a theory of meaning or representation**

    * Semantic properties are not foundational.

---

## X. Meta-Theoretical Consequences

45. **IER is falsifiable only indirectly**

    * Refutation would require showing the regime incoherent or impossible.

46. **IER is neutral on many traditional disputes**

    * It does not settle debates about qualia types, content, or reportability.

47. **IER blocks panpsychist sliding**

    * No minimal experience without intrinsic constraint.

48. **IER blocks behaviorist sliding**

    * No experience without internal regime identity.

49. **IER blocks epiphenomenalism**

    * Experience just is causal physical dynamics.

50. **IER blocks anthropocentrism**

    * Human-like traits have no privileged status.
