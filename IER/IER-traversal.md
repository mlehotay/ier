# **IER-traversal**

## **Status and scope**

This article clarifies **what choosing is** under Informational Experiential Realism (IER) by making explicit a dynamic process already presupposed across the corpus.

Its task is narrow and structural:

* to explain **choice as traversal**, not selection
* to describe **how resolution unfolds over time**
* to show **how agency and responsibility attach without adding causal machinery**

This article introduces:

* no new primitives
* no criteria or thresholds
* no redefinitions of experience, ownership, or agency

It adds **dynamics**, not foundations.

Nothing here appeals to deliberation, internal observers, representations, or decision procedures.
Nothing here licenses diagnostics or introspective access.

## **Why “choice” needs a dynamic account**

Ordinary language treats choice as a **punctate act**: a moment of selection among options.

That picture fails structurally under IER.

Resolution does not occur at isolated instants.
It unfolds continuously as a system moves through a constrained space of admissible futures.

Several familiar intuitions point to this already:

* “Doing nothing” still has consequences
* Delay itself forecloses alternatives
* Momentum, habit, and pressure shape outcomes without any decisive moment

These are not failures of choice.
They are signatures of **continuous traversal**.

If a system exists under intrinsic constraint, then **resolution always happens**.
The only question is not *whether* traversal occurs, but **how it unfolds and where its cost is borne**.

## **Admissible futures as a traversable topology**

At any moment, a system occupies a position within a **topology of admissible futures**.

This topology:

* is defined by physical law and system organization
* specifies which transitions are locally reachable
* constrains motion without enumerating options
* exists whether or not it is accessible or representable

Crucially:

* there is no menu of alternatives
* there are no discrete branches awaiting selection
* there is only **local reachability under constraint**

Traversal is therefore not movement between listed options.
It is **motion within a continuous constraint geometry**.

## **Traversal instead of selection**

Under IER, **choice is traversal**.

Traversal means:

* movement under intrinsic constraint
* guided by cost gradients, inertia, and structural bias
* unfolding over time rather than occurring at a point

Bias, habit, compulsion, fatigue, and momentum are not external influences on choice.
They are **features of the topology itself**.

Nothing “chooses” the path from outside.
The system moves as it must, given:

* where it is
* what remains reachable
* how constraint is distributed

This does not eliminate choice.
It explains why choice feels **continuous, pressured, and irreversible**.

---

## **Settlement and curing**

As traversal proceeds, some locally admissible futures cease to be reachable.

This is **settlement**.

Settlement is:

* local
* irreversible
* structural rather than mnemonic

Nothing needs to be stored or remembered.
Alternatives disappear because the topology has been **deformed by traversal itself**.

IER sometimes refers to this as *curing*:
the local resolution of constraint that stabilizes one continuation and excludes others.

Curing does not require awareness, endorsement, or evaluation.
It is simply what happens when traversal proceeds far enough that return is no longer structurally available.

---

## **Agency as owned traversal**

Traversal occurs in all systems.

**Agency** distinguishes a subset of cases: those in which traversal is **owned**.

Ownership does not add causal power.
It does not interrupt physics or redirect motion.

Ownership consists in this structural fact:

> **the intrinsic cost of traversal is borne non-externalizably within a Unified Experiential Field.**

When traversal is owned:

* resolution is carried forward by the same system
* cost cannot be displaced or offloaded
* deformation of the topology is attributable to that system’s continuation

Agency is therefore not a controller.
It is **a mode of traversal under intrinsic constraint**.

---

## **Responsibility and control**

Because traversal deforms future topology, it grounds **authorship**.

Responsibility does not require:

* freedom from physical law
* indeterminism
* selection among unconstrained options

It requires only that:

* traversal occurred
* deformation followed
* the cost was owned

Control, under IER, is not domination of outcomes.
It is **the degree to which traversal remains responsive to local constraint structure** rather than collapsing into forced motion under overload or coercion.

Nothing here escapes physics.
Nothing needs to.

## **What this article does not claim**

This article does **not** claim:

* that deliberation is required for choice
* that introspective access tracks traversal
* that choices can be enumerated in advance
* that agency introduces new forces or mechanisms
* that traversal can be diagnosed or measured

It describes **how resolution unfolds**, not how to detect or optimize it.

---

## **Intermission**

**Orientation signal:**
*Choice is not a moment where alternatives vanish; it is the motion by which they do.*
