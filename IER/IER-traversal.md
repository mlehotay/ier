# 🔹 COPYPASTA 1 — NEW CONVERSATION

## **Drafting `IER-traversal.md` (T2)**

### Article identity

* **Tier:** T2 — Elaboration and unification
* **Document type:** Canon-governed, non-normative explanatory article
* **Purpose:** To state *what choosing is* under Informational Experiential Realism (IER), in dynamic terms

This article introduces **no new primitives**, **no criteria**, and **no thresholds**.
It makes explicit a process already presupposed across the corpus.

### Central thesis (must appear clearly)

> **Choice is not selection but traversal: the continuous resolution of intrinsic constraint across a topology of admissible futures, whose traversal irreversibly deforms that topology.**

---

### Canon constraints (do not violate)

* Do **not** redefine experience, UEFs, ownership, or agency
* Do **not** introduce:

  * representation
  * deliberation
  * evaluation
  * internal observers
  * branching decision trees
* Traversal is **physical and structural**, not epistemic or psychological
* Resolution always occurs; the only question is **where ownership lies**

---

### Required conceptual alignments

This article must be fully compatible with:

* `IER-choice.md` — local admissibility without deliberation
* `IER-resolution.md` — resolution without executive control
* `IER-agency.md` — agency as owned resolution
* `IER-topology.md` — admissible futures as constraint geometry

This article **adds dynamics**, not definitions.

### Outline (must be followed closely)

1. **Status and scope**

   * Why this article exists
   * What it clarifies without adding commitments

2. **Why “choice” needs a dynamic account**

   * Why selection metaphors fail
   * Why “doing nothing” is still traversal

3. **Admissible futures as a traversable topology**

   * Local reachability
   * No option sets, no menus

4. **Traversal instead of selection**

   * Movement under constraint
   * Bias, inertia, and cost gradients as topological features

5. **Settlement and curing**

   * Local collapse of alternatives
   * Irreversibility without memory or storage

6. **Agency as owned traversal**

   * What distinguishes owned from unowned traversal
   * Why agency adds no new causal power

7. **Responsibility and control**

   * How traversal grounds authorship
   * Why freedom-from-physics is unnecessary

8. **What this article does not claim**

   * No deliberation requirement
   * No introspective access
   * No diagnostics

9. **Intermission** (single structural fact or orientation signal)

### What success looks like

A reader should finish this article understanding:

* why choice is continuous, not punctate
* why resolution always happens
* why “choosing otherwise” means topology, not counterfactual will
* why agency survives without a chooser
