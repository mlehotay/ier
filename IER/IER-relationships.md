### *Relational Regimes as Constraint Accommodation Patterns Under Informational Experiential Realism*

---

## 0. Status, Scope, and Canon Position

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no new ontological claims**
* introduces **no ethical principles or obligations**
* does **not** define experience or experiential standing
* does **not** rank relationship types
* does **not** prescribe which relationships ought to be chosen
* does **not** privilege love or any other regime

All ontological authority remains fixed **exclusively** in the IER Specification and its canonical derivatives.

**Purpose of this document**

> **To define what a relationship is under Informational Experiential Realism (IER), and to map the space of possible relational regimes by their structural geometry.**

This document serves as the **foundational map and index** for the *Relational and Multi-Subject Regimes* section.

### Section-Level Invariants (Binding on All Documents)

All relational analysis in IER presupposes:

* **Single-UEF dominance** — each experiential subject has exactly one Unified Experiential Field
* **Structural privacy** — no subject has access to another’s intrinsic constraint
* **No fusion** — UEFs do not merge
* **No shared intrinsic constraint**
* **No transfer of experiential standing**
* **No collective experiencer**

Relationships coordinate subjects.
They never combine them.

## 1. What a “Relationship” Is Under IER

Under Informational Experiential Realism, a relationship is **not**:

* a feeling
* an emotion
* a role
* a social label
* a moral entitlement
* a shared experience
* a collective subject
* a metaphysical bond

A relationship **is**:

> **A stable pattern of interaction in which one or more experiential subjects reshape their own admissible futures in response to one another’s intrinsic constraint.**

This reshaping occurs **within** each subject.

No subject ever:

* bears another’s intrinsic constraint,
* resolves it for them,
* or internalizes their experiential burden.

Relationships are therefore **organizational regimes**, not ontological mergers.

---

## 2. Constraint Accommodation (Shared Mechanism)

All relational regimes analyzed in this section rely on a single core mechanism:

### Constraint Accommodation

**Constraint accommodation** occurs when a subject:

* adjusts its own expectations, actions, commitments, or future plans
* in response to the presence, needs, or instability of another subject
* in a way that makes that other subject’s continued coherence more viable

Crucially:

* accommodation is **indirect**
* it does **not** absorb the other subject’s intrinsic constraint
* it does **not** substitute for their own resolution dynamics

Accommodation stabilizes *conditions*, not *experience itself*.

This mechanism can be:

* episodic or sustained
* mutual or asymmetric
* short- or long-horizon
* voluntary or inherited

Those differences define **distinct relational regimes**.

---

## 3. Axes of Relational Variation

IER distinguishes relational regimes using a small set of **structural axes**.

These axes describe **constraint geometry**, not moral value.

### 3.1 Time Horizon

How far into the future coordination extends.

* immediate
* short
* medium
* long
* inherited / pre-agency

---

### 3.2 Reciprocity

Whether constraint accommodation is mutual.

* none
* optional
* mutual
* asymmetric

---

### 3.3 Future Binding

Whether accommodation is assumed across unknown future conditions.

* none
* optional
* contextual
* constitutive (non-optional)

---

### 3.4 Symmetry

Whether accommodation burdens are balanced.

* symmetric
* asymmetric
* role-based

---

### 3.5 Cost Structure

How much the subject narrows its own admissible futures.

* minimal
* low
* moderate
* high
* very high

---

### 3.6 Exit Structure

How easily participation can be withdrawn.

* easy
* renegotiable
* costly
* structurally constrained

## 4. The Relational Regime Map (Non-Evaluative)

The table below is **descriptive only**.
It does not imply legitimacy, superiority, or moral worth.

| Regime       | Time Horizon     | Reciprocity | Future Binding | Symmetry          | Cost        | Exit Structure           |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ----------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Stranger     | Immediate        | None        | None           | Symmetric         | Minimal     | Easy                     |
| Acquaintance | Short            | Minimal     | None           | Symmetric         | Low         | Easy                     |
| Friendship   | Medium           | Mutual      | Optional       | Roughly symmetric | Moderate    | Renegotiable             |
| Family       | Inherited / Long | Asymmetric  | Contextual     | Asymmetric        | High        | Costly                   |
| Caregiving   | Variable         | Asymmetric  | Contextual     | Asymmetric        | High        | Costly                   |
| Love         | Long             | Mutual      | Constitutive   | May vary          | Very high   | Structurally constrained |
| Groups       | Variable         | Role-based  | Norm-mediated  | Role-based        | Distributed | Role-dependent           |

Each regime is **stable only within its own geometry**.

## 5. Why Relational Confusion Is Common

Relational confusion arises when:

* emotional intensity is mistaken for future binding
* salience is mistaken for reciprocity
* cost is mistaken for obligation
* duration is mistaken for identity fusion
* coordination is mistaken for shared experience

Early-stage experiential signatures often look similar across regimes.

IER resolves this confusion by asking:

* **Who reshapes their future?**
* **For how long?**
* **With what assumptions about reciprocity and exit?**

Most relational conflict results from **importing the cost or binding structure of one regime into another**.

---

## 6. What This Section Explicitly Denies

Across all relational regimes, IER denies:

* moral ranking of relationship types
* obligation inflation (“this must be forever”)
* fusion narratives (“we become one”)
* experiential standing transfer
* collective subjecthood
* epistemic authority from relational meaning

Significance ≠ justification
Intensity ≠ obligation
Coordination ≠ experience

## 7. Pointer Map to Section Documents

Each document in this section occupies a **distinct structural region** of the map.

* **IER-Love**
  Long-horizon *mutual* constraint accommodation
  Maximal cost, non-scalable, identity-relevant coordination

* **IER-Friendship**
  Medium-horizon *mutual* accommodation
  Voluntary, episodic, highly renegotiable coordination

* **IER-Family**
  Inherited, asymmetric, long-horizon regimes
  Identity formation under non-chosen constraint

* **IER-Caregiving**
  Sustained asymmetric stabilization
  High cost without reciprocal future binding

* **IER-Groups**
  Coordination without subjecthood
  Role-mediated, norm-distributed constraint without experience

Each document develops **only its own region**, using the shared machinery defined here.

---

## 8. Ethical Neutrality Statement

IER-Relationships does **not** claim that:

* any relationship type is morally superior
* any relationship type is morally mandatory
* refusing a relationship is blameworthy
* cost implies owedness
* duration implies permanence

IER explains **how relational regimes work**.
It does not command which ones to enter.

---

## 9. Closing

Under Informational Experiential Realism, relationships are not defined by labels, feelings, or moral narratives.

They are distinguished by:

* how intrinsic constraint is accommodated,
* across how much time,
* with what reciprocity,
* at what cost,
* and under what exit conditions.

> **Clarity comes from letting each relational regime remain what it is —
> and refusing to force it to become something else.**
