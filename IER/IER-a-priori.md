## **Permanent Suspicion: Why Identity Theories Are Always “Not Enough”**

---

## **Status and Scope**

This document is **diagnostic and meta-theoretical**.

It:

* introduces **no new ontological commitments**
* defends **no particular physical substrate**
* proposes **no diagnostics, thresholds, or empirical tests**
* advances **no ethical principles**
* resolves **no theory-specific disputes**

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md
```

This document explains **why identity theories of consciousness reliably attract the same objections regardless of their internal details**, and clarifies **which explanatory demands are structurally incompatible with identity itself**.

For a systematic account of how these pressures apply **specifically to Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**—including which are resisted, which are accepted as costs, and which would collapse the framework—see:

```
IER-critics.md
```

If any claim here conflicts with the Specification, **the Specification takes precedence**.

---

## **Purpose**

Identity theories of consciousness are not evaluated on a neutral playing field.

Before any details are examined, such theories are typically expected to:

* explain consciousness *in third-person terms*
* preserve *phenomenal transparency*
* support *diagnostic access*
* deliver *structural mappings on demand*
* render subjective character intuitively intelligible

When these expectations are not met, identity theories are often judged to have failed—even when the failure follows directly from what **identity** is.

The purpose of this document is to make that dynamic explicit.

It explains:

1. **Why identity theories attract predictable objections sight unseen**
2. **Why many of those objections recur independently of theory-specific content**
3. **Which explanatory demands cannot be satisfied without abandoning identity**
4. **What counts as success or failure for an identity theory on its own terms**

This document does **not** argue that identity theories are true.
It clarifies **how they are evaluated and why that evaluation is unusually fraught**.

---

## **Orientation Note**

This document deliberately **does not answer** the objections it describes.

That is not an omission.

Its task is to explain **why these objections arise prior to, and independently of, any particular identity theory**, and why treating their non-satisfaction as decisive already presupposes a rejection of identity as a philosophical posture.

Responses to these objections—where possible, where refused, and where costs are accepted—belong in:

```
IER-critics.md
```

This document takes **no position** on whether the objections ultimately succeed.

---

## **How to Read This Document**

This document does not defend IER.

It maps the **a priori evaluative pressures** placed on any theory that claims:

> **Experience is identical to a physical state or regime.**

If a reader rejects identity as a metaphysical strategy, this document will not persuade them.

If a reader accepts identity in principle, this document clarifies **what that acceptance commits them to—and what it rules out**.

## **I. What You Can Say About Any Identity Theory Sight Unseen**

### **I.1 The inevitability of explanatory suspicion**

If someone proposes a new identity theory of consciousness today, one can predict—with high confidence—that it will be accused of:

* relabeling rather than explaining
* failing to close the explanatory gap
* denying phenomenal transparency
* mishandling multiple realizability
* arbitrarily selecting conscious states
* under-delivering on phenomenal structure
* evading the force of modal arguments

These accusations do **not** depend on the theory’s internal details.

They arise from the **identity strategy itself**.

Identity collapses two descriptions into one referent.
It does not, by itself, provide a further explanation of *why that referent has the features pre-theoretically associated with experience*.

In most scientific domains, this kind of explanatory termination is unproblematic.
In the case of consciousness, it is persistently experienced as a deficit.

---

### **I.2 The seven recurring accusations**

Before any identity theory is examined in detail, critics typically expect that:

1. **Identity ≠ explanation**
   “You told me *what* consciousness is, not *why it feels like something*.”

2. **The explanatory gap remains**
   “Complete physical knowledge still leaves something out.”

3. **Phenomenal transparency is denied**
   “You’re telling me experience isn’t as it seems.”

4. **Multiple realizability is mishandled**
   “Either the theory is chauvinistic or it collapses into functionalism.”

5. **Selection is arbitrary**
   “Why *this* physical state rather than countless similar ones?”

6. **Phenomenal structure is under-explained**
   “Where is the mapping from physical relations to experiential relations?”

7. **Modal force is deflected rather than answered**
   “The theory denies the evidential force of conceivability.”

Individually, none of these constitutes a refutation.
Together, they form a **persistent evaluative backdrop** against which identity theories are judged.

---

## **II. Canonical Identity Attack Vectors**

This section describes the **form and motivation** of standard objections without applying them to any particular theory.

---

### **II.A The “That’s Not an Explanation” Attack**

**Form**

> “Even if consciousness is identical to X, you haven’t explained *why X feels like something*.”

**Underlying demand**

Critics seek an explanatory ascent: a story in which non-experiential elements combine, transform, or give rise to experiential ones.

Identity theories characteristically deny that such ascent is available.
Once X = Y, metaphysical explanation terminates.

The dissatisfaction here is not logical.
It reflects resistance to accepting explanatory termination *in the phenomenal case*.

---

### **II.B The Explanatory Gap and Epistemic Asymmetry**

**Form**

> “I can know everything about the physical state and still not know what it’s like.”

Identity theories typically reinterpret this gap as epistemic, cognitive, or structural rather than metaphysical.

They do not eliminate the gap.
They deny that it indicates ontological incompleteness.

Any identity theory that preserves first-person distinctiveness inherits this pressure.

---

### **II.C Modal and Conceivability Arguments**

**Form**

> “I can conceive of the physical state without the experience—so they cannot be identical.”

These arguments treat conceivability as evidence of metaphysical possibility.

Identity theories characteristically deny this inference, appealing to a posteriori necessity or structural constraints on identity.

This response is widely regarded as counterintuitive but is difficult to avoid within an identity framework.

---

### **II.D Multiple Realizability Pressure**

**Form**

> “If consciousness can occur in different substrates, identity seems too narrow.”

Critics demand avoidance of:

* species chauvinism
* functional triviality
* panpsychist inflation

Identity theories often respond by shifting from substrate to organizational or dynamical identity, but the pressure itself persists.

---

### **II.E The Selection Problem (“Why This State?”)**

**Form**

> “Why is *this* physical process conscious rather than countless similar ones?”

This objection targets arbitrariness, boundary conditions, and minimal criteria.

Identity theories struggle here because local identities invite arbitrariness, while system-level identities invite vagueness.

---

### **II.F Phenomenal Structure Matching**

**Form**

> “Does the structure of experience mirror the structure of the physical state?”

Increasingly, critics demand recoverable mappings for similarity, intensity, unity, and differentiation.

Identity theories often promise correspondence without providing operational reconstructions that satisfy this demand.

---

### **II.G Introspection vs. Neuroscience Mismatch**

**Form**

> “Experience seems unified and immediate, but the brain appears fragmented and complex.”

Identity theories respond by reinterpreting introspection, demoting its evidential role, or explaining its apparent simplicity.

Each response carries philosophical cost.

---

## **III. What Identity Theories Typically Lack (and Why)**

The following absences recur across otherwise diverse identity theories and are often mistaken for failures.

---

### **III.1 No non-stipulative individuation without regime identity**

Explaining why one experience exists rather than many—or none—requires principled individuation.

Identity theories that avoid subject-level primitives face genuine difficulty here.
This reflects structural constraints, not oversight.

---

### **III.2 Thin accounts of qualitative character**

Identity theories are well-suited to **existence claims** (“experience is physical”) but less suited to **character claims** (“why red feels red”).

This asymmetry follows from rejection of phenomenal primitives, not from negligence.

---

### **III.3 No automatic bridge from neuroscience to phenomenology**

Asserting identity does not generate:

* translation manuals
* reconstruction procedures
* diagnostic pipelines

Expecting such bridges conflates metaphysical identity with methodological access.

---

### **III.4 Weak intuitive support**

Compared to dualism, panpsychism, or functionalism, identity theories lack immediate intuitive appeal.

They rely on ontological economy, scientific realism, and anti-intuitionism—strengths that often function as rhetorical liabilities.

---

## **IV. What an Identity Theory Must Do to Be Taken Seriously**

This section identifies constraints commonly treated as non-negotiable.

---

### **IV.1 Core constraints**

A serious identity theory is typically expected to:

* be compatible with token identity
* avoid species chauvinism
* resist panpsychist trivialization
* offer principled individuation
* maintain ontological economy

Failure on these points is usually treated as disqualifying.

---

### **IV.2 Optional but frequently demanded features**

Critics often also demand:

* diagnostic access
* phenomenal reconstruction
* intuitive transparency

These demands are understandable.
They are also frequently **incompatible with identity itself**, rather than merely unmet.

---

## **V. What This Document Does—and Does Not—Settle**

This document does **not** claim that the objections surveyed here fail.

It claims something prior and narrower:

* that these objections arise **before** theory-specific evaluation
* that many of them are **not neutral**
* that some express demands **identity theories cannot satisfy in principle**
* and that treating their non-satisfaction as decisive already presupposes rejection of identity

If a theory fails to meet demands that are structurally incompatible with its identity claim, that failure is not internal to the theory.
It reflects disagreement about **what counts as explanation at all**.

Whether a given identity theory should resist, reinterpret, or accept these demands as costs is a **theory-internal matter**.

For Informational Experiential Realism, those decisions are made explicitly in:

```
IER-critics.md
```

Disagreement at that stage is substantive and legitimate.

Disagreement at this stage concerns **the kind of explanation one is willing to accept**, not the adequacy of any particular theory.

---

## **VI. Conclusion: Identity Under Permanent Suspicion**

Identity theories of consciousness are not rejected solely because they are incoherent.

They are rejected because they refuse to satisfy certain explanatory expectations that many critics treat as non-negotiable.

This document has not defended that refusal.
It has made it visible.

Whether identity theories are justified in denying those demands is a further philosophical question—one that can only be addressed once the identity posture itself is clearly understood.
