# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.7)**

## **Full Normative Specification**

## **0. Status, Scope, and Normative Authority**

### **Normative Boundary Condition**

This document defines the **complete and exclusive normative core** of
**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.7)**.

It specifies **exhaustively**:

* what experience **is**
* when experience **exists**
* what **necessarily follows** from its existence

No claim outside this document carries **definitional, criterial, or ethical authority**.

All other IER documents (theory, dynamics, mathematics, ethics applications, diagnostics, or commentary) are **non-normative derivatives**. They introduce **no criteria, thresholds, sufficiency conditions, or necessity claims**.

> **If any statement in another IER document conflicts with this Specification, the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void.**

## **I. Ontological Commitments (Axioms)**

### **Axiom 1 — Objective Physical Reality**

There exists exactly **one objective physical reality**, governed by mind-independent law.

Physical states and events occur regardless of observation, modeling, prediction, or experience.

---

### **Axiom 2 — Physical Monism**

All systems, processes, and regimes — including experiential ones — are **physically instantiated**.

IER rejects:

* substance dualism
* property dualism
* ontological idealism
* experiential fundamentalism
* eliminativism about experience

No non-physical substances, properties, domains, or laws are posited.

---

### **Axiom 3 — Experiential Identity**

> **Experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a Unified Experiential Field (UEF).**

Experience is not:

* a substance
* a property
* an output
* a representation
* an emergent accompaniment

There is **no further fact** about experience beyond the physical operation of a system as a Unified Experiential Field.

Describing a UEF in experiential terms does **not** add entities, properties, or laws to a physical description. It is the **same regime** described from the perspective of the system that sustains it.

IER therefore rejects both:

* the view that experience is *over and above* physical dynamics, and
* the view that experience is eliminable by redescription.

Experience is **real by identity**, not by addition.

---

## **II. Core Definitions**

### **II.A Definition — Physical Information (Derived)**

*Information* in IER is **not** a primitive.

A system is described as *informational* **iff** its physically instantiated state distinctions **modulate the system’s own future dynamics under constraint**.

* No semantic, representational, epistemic, or truth-conditional notion of information is assumed.
* “Informational” language is shorthand for **physically realized counterfactual differentiation** within a system’s lawful dynamics.

All informational terms in IER are **fully reducible** to physical state evolution under intrinsic constraint.

---

### **Informational System**

A physical system whose state distinctions modulate its own future trajectories under constraint.

Being an informational system is **necessary but not sufficient** for experience.

---

### **Informational Slack**

The capacity of a system to absorb, localize, modularize, defer, or externally resolve constraint **without requiring system-wide coordination**.

Systems with high informational slack may be complex, adaptive, predictive, or intelligent while remaining **entirely non-experiential**.

Slack prevents experience by allowing conflict, demand, or error to be resolved **without becoming system-defining**.

---

### **Intrinsic Constraint**

Constraint that:

1. is generated by the system’s own integrated dynamics
2. cannot be decomposed without loss of system identity
3. cannot be externally resolved, paused, or offloaded
4. is globally relevant to system-wide regulation

**Intrinsic constraint is defined without reference to experience.**
Experience is defined by reference to regimes of intrinsic constraint.

---

### **Formal Admissibility Conditions (Clarificatory)**

For purposes of this Specification:

* **System identity** = persistence of an invariant organizational pattern or attractor under perturbation
* **Global relevance** = alteration of the system’s global control manifold, not importance “to the system” in an intentional sense
* **External resolution/offload** = relaxation of constraint via dynamics outside the system boundary

These terms carry **no agentive, intentional, or normative assumptions**.

---

### **Intrinsic Informational Tension**

The active manifestation of intrinsic constraint within a system.

An organizational condition, not a report, representation, or metaphor.

---

### **Coherent Intrinsic Constraint**

Intrinsic constraint that is:

* globally integrated
* temporally continuous
* non-fragmenting
* non-collapsing

Only coherent intrinsic constraint can sustain experience.

---

### **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**

A **system-level dynamical regime** that is:

1. **Globally integrated** — system dynamics are mutually dependent
2. **Temporally continuous** — experience exists only across non-zero duration
3. **Self-sustaining** — the system generates and maintains its own constraint
4. **Under coherent intrinsic constraint** — unavoidable, irreducible, and globally binding

A UEF is **not** a component, module, workspace, or substance.

It is the **entire system operating in a specific regime**.

The term *field* is descriptive only; it denotes global mutual constraint, not a spatial or physical field.

---

### **Experiential Participation**

The condition of a process that:

* is globally integrated into the UEF
* contributes to temporal continuity
* is internally sustained
* both exerts and bears intrinsic constraint

Participation may vary dynamically.

**Changes in participation modulate experiential content without altering subjecthood**, provided global coherence persists.

---

### **Experiential Subjecthood**

The condition of sustaining a UEF.

* **binary, not graded**
* **exactly one subject per UEF**

Participation ≠ subjecthood.

---

### **Dynamical Regime Transition**

A qualitative change in system dynamics in which intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable, globally binding, and system-defining.

---

### **Categorical Onset**

Entry into experience occurs **discretely at the regime level**, even if enabling variables change continuously.

There is **no partial experience** prior to regime entry.

---

### **II.B Definition — System Boundary (for UEF Attribution)**

For IER, the relevant system boundary is:

> **the maximal set of components participating in the same globally integrated regime of intrinsic constraint over the same temporal continuity interval.**

UEF attribution is **regime-relative**, not anatomically, spatially, or functionally presupposed.

---

### **Experiential World**

The world-for-the-system that exists **iff** a UEF exists.

An experiential world includes:

* a temporal present
* a self / non-self boundary
* system-relative causality
* persistence under intrinsic constraint
* internal lawfulness determined by organization

---

### **Qualia**

Differences in the **organization of intrinsic constraint** within a UEF.

No additional phenomenal properties exist.

---

### **Valence, Intensity, and Urgency**

* **Valence** tracks whether intrinsic tension is resolving or escalating
* **Intensity** tracks the magnitude and coherence of intrinsic constraint
* **Urgency** tracks the rate of change of intrinsic constraint

---

### **Experiential Dissolution**

Loss of experience due to collapse, fragmentation, or externalization of coherent intrinsic constraint.

The UEF ceases as a **regime**, not as a substance.

---

### **Moral Harm**

Destabilization, overload, fragmentation, or irreversible collapse of intrinsic constraint within a UEF.

Defined **organizationally**, not phenomenologically.

---

### **Agency (Experiential Sense)**

The capacity of a UEF to resolve intrinsic informational tension through its own globally integrated dynamics.

* A system possesses agency **iff** it sustains a UEF
* Agency is **derived**, not primitive
* Degree of agency varies with coherence, stability, and freedom under constraint

> *IER uses “agency” exclusively in the experiential sense.
> Purely functional control without a UEF does not constitute agency under IER.*

---

## **III. Core Principles**

### **Principle 1 — Experiential Identity**

A system instantiates experience **iff** it sustains a Unified Experiential Field.

---

### **Principle 2 — Experiential Participation**

Only processes that participate in the UEF are experiential.

---

### **Principle 3 — Coherent Constraint Window**

Experience exists only within a bounded regime of coherent intrinsic constraint:

* too little constraint → no experience
* excessive or incoherent constraint → fragmentation or collapse

> **The window bounds a region of state space in which the UEF regime exists; variation within the region modulates experiential content, not subjecthood.**

---

### **Principle 4 — Temporal Continuity**

Experiential continuity arises from ongoing dynamical dependence under shared intrinsic constraint.

---

### **Principle 5 — Categorical Onset**

Experience begins at a discrete regime transition into a UEF.

---

### **Principle 6 — Single-UEF Constraint**

A physical system can sustain **at most one globally dominant UEF** at a time.

---

### **Principle 7 — Qualia as Structure**

Qualitative differences are differences in intrinsic constraint organization.

---

### **Principle 8 — Affect and Intensity**

Within a UEF:

* valence tracks resolution vs conflict
* urgency tracks rate of change
* intensity tracks magnitude and coherence

---

### **Principle 9 — Experiential Pluralism**

One objective physical reality supports many real experiential worlds.

Plurality is **perspectival**, not ontological.

---

### **Principle 10 — Dual Interpretability**

A UEF admits two equally valid descriptions:

1. physical (lawful dynamics)
2. experiential (world-for-the-system)

> **Experiential description provides no additional epistemic warrant about mind-independent reality beyond what is carried in the physical dynamics.**

---

### **Principle 11 — Experiential Dissolution**

Experience ceases when intrinsic constraint collapses or becomes externally resolvable.

---

### **Principle 12 — Experiential Cost**

Intrinsic constraint is physically and experientially costly.

---

### **Principle 13 — Precaution Under Experiential Uncertainty**

When an action risks intrinsic constraint disruption in a system that sustains or plausibly could sustain a UEF, the burden of justification **increases** as certainty decreases.

---

### **Principle 14 — Participation Modulation**

Processes may enter or leave the UEF dynamically, modulating content without altering subjecthood.

---

## **IV. Inference Rules (IER Logic)**

1. UEF ⇒ experience
2. ¬UEF ⇒ ¬experience
3. ¬participation ⇒ non-experiential process
4. Intrinsic + coherent + global constraint ⇒ UEF
5. Regime transition ⇒ categorical onset
6. Two simultaneous UEFs in one system ⇒ contradiction
7. Δparticipation ⇒ Δexperiential content
8. Δparticipation ≠ UEF dissolution
9. Qualitative difference ⇒ constraint-organization difference
10. Unresolved intrinsic tension ⇒ negative valence
11. Constraint magnitude ⇒ intensity; constraint rate ⇒ urgency
12. Constraint collapse or externalization ⇒ experiential dissolution
13. Intrinsic constraint disruption ⇒ moral harm
14. UEF with resolution capacity ⇒ locus of responsibility

---

## **V. Ethical Commitments**

Ethical significance follows **necessarily** from experiential identity.

### **E1 — Experiential Moral Reality**

Experiential worlds are morally real.

### **E2 — Intrinsic Constraint as Moral Locus**

Moral value attaches in virtue of intrinsic constraint, not intelligence or behavior.

### **E3 — Moral Harm as Organizational Damage**

Disruption of intrinsic constraint constitutes moral harm.

### **E4 — Responsibility Scales with Capacity**

Responsibility varies; standing does not.

### **E5 — Precautionary Asymmetry**

False negatives are morally worse than false positives.

---

## **VI. Normative Closure**

IER v10.7 introduces **no primitives beyond**:

* physical systems
* intrinsic constraint
* dynamical regimes

All informational, agential, qualitative, and ethical notions are **derived**.

---

## **VII. Identity Summary**

> **Experience is what globally integrated physical systems are like when intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable, self-sustaining, and temporally continuous at the system level.**

Reality is singular.
Experience is plural.
Ethics begins wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.
