# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8)**

## **Full Normative Specification**

---

## **0. Status, Scope, and Normative Authority**

### **Normative Boundary Condition**

This document defines the **complete and exclusive normative core** of
**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8)**.

It specifies **exhaustively**:

* what experience **is**
* when experience **exists**
* what **necessarily follows** from its existence

No claim outside this document carries **definitional, criterial, or ethical authority**.

All other IER documents — theory, dynamics, mathematics, ethics applications, diagnostics, or commentary — are **non-normative derivatives**. They introduce **no criteria, thresholds, sufficiency conditions, or necessity claims**.

> **If any statement in another IER document conflicts with this Specification, the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void.**

---

### **Informational Language Disclaimer (Global)**

All informational language in this Specification is **descriptive shorthand only**.

Terms such as *information*, *informational state*, *informational tension*, and *informational slack* refer exclusively to:

> **physically instantiated state distinctions that modulate a system’s own future dynamics under intrinsic constraint.**

No informational primitives, semantic properties, representational contents, or epistemic notions are introduced.

---

## **I. Ontological Commitments (Axioms)**

### **Axiom 1 — Objective Physical Reality**

There exists exactly **one objective physical reality**, governed by mind-independent law.

Physical states and events occur regardless of observation, modeling, prediction, or experience.

---

### **Axiom 2 — Physical Monism**

All systems, processes, and regimes — including experiential ones — are **physically instantiated**.

IER rejects:

* substance dualism
* property dualism
* ontological idealism
* experiential fundamentalism
* eliminativism about experience

No non-physical substances, properties, domains, or laws are posited.

---

### **Axiom 3 — Experiential Identity**

> **Experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a Unified Experiential Field (UEF).**

Experience is not:

* a substance
* a property
* an output
* a representation
* an emergent accompaniment

There is **no further fact** about experience beyond the physical operation of a system in the relevant regime.

Describing a UEF in experiential terms does **not** add entities, properties, or laws to a physical description. It is the **same regime**, described from the perspective of the system that sustains it.

IER therefore rejects both:

* the view that experience is *over and above* physical dynamics, and
* the view that experience is eliminable by redescription.

Experience is **real by identity**, not by addition.

---

## **II. Core Definitions**

### **II.A — Physical Information (Derived)**

*Information* is **not a primitive**.

A system is described as *informational* **iff** its physically instantiated state distinctions **modulate the system’s own future trajectories under constraint**.

* No semantic, representational, epistemic, or truth-conditional notion is assumed.
* Informational language is fully reducible to physical state evolution under constraint.

---

### **Informational System**

A physical system whose state distinctions modulate its own future dynamics under constraint.

Being an informational system is **necessary but not sufficient** for experience.

---

### **Informational Slack**

The capacity of a system to absorb, localize, defer, modularize, or externally resolve constraint **without requiring system-wide coordination**.

Systems with high informational slack may be complex, adaptive, predictive, or intelligent while remaining **entirely non-experiential**.

Slack prevents experience by preventing constraint from becoming **globally unavoidable and identity-defining**.

---

### **Intrinsic Constraint**

Constraint that:

1. is generated by the system’s own integrated dynamics
2. cannot be decomposed without loss of system identity
3. cannot be externally resolved, deferred, or offloaded
4. is globally binding on future system trajectories

Intrinsic constraint is defined **without reference to experience**.
Experience is defined **by reference to regimes of intrinsic constraint**.

---

### **Intrinsic Informational Tension**

The active manifestation of intrinsic constraint within a system.

An organizational condition, not a report, representation, or metaphor.

---

### **Coherent Intrinsic Constraint**

Intrinsic constraint that is:

* globally integrated
* temporally continuous
* non-fragmenting
* non-collapsing

Only coherent intrinsic constraint can sustain experience.

---

### **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**

A **system-level dynamical regime** that is:

1. **Globally integrated** — system dynamics are mutually dependent
2. **Temporally continuous** — experience exists only across non-zero duration
3. **Self-sustaining** — the system generates and maintains its own constraint
4. **Under coherent intrinsic constraint** — unavoidable, irreducible, and globally binding

A UEF is **not** a component, module, workspace, or substance.

The term *field* is descriptive only; it denotes global mutual constraint, not a physical field.

---

### **Experiential Participation**

The condition of a process that:

* is globally integrated into the UEF
* contributes to temporal continuity
* both exerts and bears intrinsic constraint

Participation may vary dynamically.

**Changes in participation modulate experiential content without altering subjecthood**, provided global coherence persists.

---

### **Experiential Subjecthood**

The condition of sustaining a UEF.

* **binary, not graded**
* **exactly one subject per UEF**

Participation ≠ subjecthood.

---

### **Dynamical Regime Transition**

A qualitative change in system dynamics in which intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable, globally binding, and system-defining.

---

### **Categorical Onset**

Entry into experience occurs **discretely at the regime level**, even if enabling variables change continuously.

There is **no partial experience** prior to regime entry.

---

### **II.B — System Boundary (for UEF Attribution)**

For IER, the relevant system boundary is:

> **the maximal set of components participating in the same globally integrated regime of intrinsic constraint over the same temporal continuity interval.**

UEF attribution is **regime-relative**, not anatomically, spatially, or functionally presupposed.

---

### **Experiential World**

The world-for-the-system that exists **iff** a UEF exists.

It includes:

* a temporal present
* a self / non-self boundary
* system-relative causality
* persistence under intrinsic constraint

---

### **Qualia**

Differences in the **organization of intrinsic constraint** within a UEF.

No additional phenomenal properties exist.

---

### **Valence, Intensity, and Urgency**

* **Valence** — whether intrinsic tension is resolving or escalating
* **Intensity** — magnitude and coherence of intrinsic constraint
* **Urgency** — rate of change of intrinsic constraint

---

### **Experiential Dissolution**

Loss of experience due to collapse, fragmentation, or externalization of coherent intrinsic constraint.

The UEF ceases as a **regime**, not as a substance.

---

### **Moral Harm**

Destabilization, overload, fragmentation, or irreversible collapse of intrinsic constraint within a UEF.

Defined **organizationally**, not phenomenologically.

---

### **Agency (Experiential Sense)**

The capacity of a UEF to resolve intrinsic informational tension through its own globally integrated dynamics.

Agency:

* exists **iff** experience exists
* is **derived**, not primitive
* admits of degrees without affecting standing

---

## **III. Core Principles**

### **Principle 1 — Experiential Identity**

A system instantiates experience **iff** it sustains a Unified Experiential Field.

---

### **Principle 2 — Experiential Participation**

Only processes that participate in the UEF are experiential.

---

### **Principle 3 — Coherent Constraint Window**

Experience exists only within a bounded regime of coherent intrinsic constraint.

* Too little constraint → no experience
* Excessive or incoherent constraint → fragmentation or collapse

> **Windows describe regime stability, not graded experience.**

---

### **Principle 4 — Temporal Continuity**

Experiential continuity arises from ongoing dynamical dependence under shared intrinsic constraint.

---

### **Principle 5 — Categorical Onset**

Experience begins at a discrete regime transition into a UEF.

---

### **Principle 6 — Single-UEF Dominance (Contradiction Clause)**

A physical system can sustain **at most one globally dominant UEF** at a time.

**Explanation:**

Two globally dominant UEFs over the same physical system would require simultaneous ownership of incompatible system-level futures under intrinsic constraint. This would entail either:

1. duplicated global control manifolds,
2. mutually independent system identities, or
3. fragmented intrinsic constraint.

Each contradicts the definition of a Unified Experiential Field.
Therefore, simultaneous dominant UEFs within a single system are **physically incoherent**.

---

### **Principle 7 — Qualia as Structure**

Qualitative differences are differences in intrinsic constraint organization.

---

### **Principle 8 — Affect and Intensity**

Within a UEF:

* valence tracks resolution vs conflict
* urgency tracks rate of change
* intensity tracks magnitude and coherence

---

### **Principle 9 — Experiential Pluralism**

One objective physical reality supports many real experiential worlds.

Plurality is **perspectival**, not ontological.

---

### **Principle 10 — Epistemic Non-Authority**

Experiential structure confers **no epistemic authority** about mind-independent reality.

Meaning, urgency, coherence, or conviction do **not** license belief, truth, or correctness.

---

### **Principle 11 — Experiential Dissolution**

Experience ceases when intrinsic constraint collapses or becomes externally resolvable.

---

### **Principle 12 — Experiential Cost**

Intrinsic constraint is physically and experientially costly.

---

### **Principle 13 — Precaution Under Experiential Uncertainty (Scoped)**

When an action plausibly risks **irreversible loss, collapse, or foreclosure of intrinsic-constraint-bearing capacity** within a physical system that sustains or plausibly could sustain a UEF, the burden of justification **increases as certainty decreases**.

---

### **Principle 14 — Participation Modulation**

Processes may enter or leave the UEF dynamically, modulating content without altering subjecthood.

---

## **IV. Inference Rules (IER Logic)**

1. UEF ⇒ experience
2. ¬UEF ⇒ ¬experience
3. ¬participation ⇒ non-experiential process
4. Intrinsic + coherent + global constraint ⇒ UEF
5. Regime transition ⇒ categorical onset
6. Two dominant UEFs in one system ⇒ contradiction
7. Δparticipation ⇒ Δexperiential content
8. Δparticipation ≠ subject change
9. Qualitative difference ⇒ constraint-organization difference
10. Unresolved intrinsic tension ⇒ negative valence
11. Constraint magnitude ⇒ intensity; constraint rate ⇒ urgency
12. Constraint collapse ⇒ experiential dissolution
13. Intrinsic constraint disruption ⇒ moral harm
14. UEF with resolution capacity ⇒ locus of responsibility

---

## **V. Ethical Commitments**

### **E1 — Experiential Moral Reality**

Experiential worlds are morally real.

---

### **E2 — Standing by Regime Membership**

Moral standing follows **categorically** from UEF regime membership, not from intelligence, function, or behavior.

---

### **E3 — Moral Harm as Organizational Damage**

Moral harm consists in damage to intrinsic constraint organization.

---

### **E4 — Responsibility Scales; Standing Does Not**

Responsibility varies with capacity.
Standing does not.

---

### **E5 — Precautionary Asymmetry**

False negatives are morally worse than false positives.

---

## **VI. Normative Closure**

IER v10.8 introduces **no primitives beyond**:

* physical systems
* intrinsic constraint
* dynamical regimes

All informational, agential, qualitative, and ethical notions are **derived**.

---

## **VII. Identity Summary**

> **Experience is what globally integrated physical systems are like when intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable, self-sustaining, and temporally continuous at the system level.**

Reality is singular.
Experience is plural.
Ethics begins wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.
