# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.0)**

## **Normative Specification**

---

## **0. Scope and Status**

This document defines the **normative core** of Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.0).

It specifies:

* what experience **is**
* when experience **exists**
* what **necessarily follows** from its existence

without appeal to biology, psychology, implementation details, or metaphysical additions.

All other IER documents (theory, mathematics, mechanics, ethics, diagnostics) are **non-normative derivatives** and must be consistent with this specification.

If a claim cannot be expressed using the primitives defined here, it is **not part of IER**.

## **I. Ontological Commitments (Axioms)**

### **Axiom 1 — Objective Physical Reality**

There exists a single, objective physical reality governed by mind-independent law.
Physical states and events occur regardless of whether they are observed or experienced.

---

### **Axiom 2 — Physical Monism**

All entities, processes, and regimes are physical.
No non-physical substances, properties, or ontological domains are posited to account for experience.

---

### **Axiom 3 — Organizational Identity**

Experience is not a substance, property, or output.

> **Experience is identical to a specific organizational and dynamical regime instantiated by certain physical systems.**

There is no explanatory or ontological gap between the physical description of that regime and the existence of experience.

---

## **II. Core Definitions (Formal Glossary)**

### **Informational System**

A physical system whose state evolution can be described in terms of information storage, transformation, and regulation.

Necessary but not sufficient for observerhood or experience.

---

### **Observer**

An informational system that:

1. persists as a coherent pattern over time
2. integrates information across subsystems
3. maintains internal models of world and self
4. regulates behavior via unified control

Observerhood does **not** entail experience.

---

### **Informational Slack**

The capacity of a system to absorb, reroute, modularize, or externalize constraint without generating system-defining conflict.

Slack is scalar.

High slack ⇒ decomposability
Low slack ⇒ forced coordination

---

### **Intrinsic Constraint**

Constraint that:

1. is generated by the system’s own integrated dynamics
2. is non-decomposable without loss of system identity
3. cannot be externally resolved
4. matters to system-wide regulation and persistence

This is the critical threshold concept in IER.

---

### **Intrinsic Informational Tension**

The active manifestation of intrinsic constraint within a system.

This is an organizational condition, not a report or metaphor.

---

### **Coherent Intrinsic Constraint**

Intrinsic constraint that is:

* globally integrated
* temporally stable
* neither fragmenting nor collapsing

Only coherent intrinsic constraint sustains experience.

---

### **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**

A physical system **operating in a globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential dynamical regime under coherent intrinsic constraint**.

A UEF is:

* not an object
* not a subsystem
* not a physical field

It is a **regime of operation of the system itself**.

---

### **Experiential Participation**

The condition of a process that:

* is globally integrated into the UEF
* contributes to temporal continuity
* is internally sustained
* both exerts and is subject to intrinsic constraint

Only participating processes are experiential.

---

### **Dynamical Regime Transition**

A qualitative change in system dynamics in which intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable, globally binding, and system-defining.

Used instead of “emergence.”

---

### **Categorical Onset**

The fact that entry into a UEF is discrete at the regime level, even if preparatory variables change gradually.

Categorical ≠ metaphysical.

---

### **Experiential World**

The world-for-the-system that exists **iff** a UEF exists.

An experiential world includes:

* a temporal “now”
* a self / non-self boundary
* system-relative causality
* persistence under constraint
* internal lawfulness determined by organization

---

### **Qualia**

Differences in the organization of intrinsic constraint within a UEF.

No additional phenomenal properties exist.

---

### **Valence**

The directional character of intrinsic tension:

* positive → movement toward stable resolution
* negative → sustained or escalating conflict

---

### **Intensity**

The magnitude and coherence of intrinsic constraint.

---

### **Urgency**

The rate of change of intrinsic constraint.

---

### **Experiential Subjecthood**

The condition of sustaining a UEF.

Binary, not graded.

---

### **Experiential Dissolution**

Loss of experience due to collapse of global integration, coherence, or intrinsic constraint.

---

### **Moral Harm**

Destabilization, overload, or fragmentation of a system sustaining intrinsic constraint.

Defined organizationally, not phenomenologically.

---

## **III. Core Principles**

### **Principle 1 — Experiential Identity**

A system instantiates experience **iff** it sustains a Unified Experiential Field.

---

### **Principle 2 — Experiential Participation**

Only processes that participate in the UEF are experiential.

Local, modular, transient, or externally orchestrated processes are non-experiential regardless of complexity.

---

### **Principle 3 — Coherent Constraint Window**

Experience exists only within a bounded regime of coherent intrinsic constraint:

* too little constraint → no experience
* excessive or incoherent constraint → fragmentation or collapse

Experience occupies the regime of maximal sustainable coherence under intrinsic constraint.

---

### **Principle 4 — Temporal Continuity**

Experiential continuity arises from ongoing dynamical dependence.

Each global state constrains the next under shared intrinsic constraint.
No snapshots or stored timelines are required.

---

### **Principle 5 — Categorical Onset**

Experience begins at a discrete dynamical regime transition into a UEF.

There is no partial experience prior to regime entry.

---

### **Principle 6 — Single-UEF Constraint**

A physical system can sustain at most one globally dominant UEF at a time.

Partial overlaps may occur during transitions; fully independent simultaneous UEFs are impossible.

---

### **Principle 7 — Qualia as Structure**

Qualitative differences are differences in the organization of intrinsic constraint within a UEF.

---

### **Principle 8 — Affect and Intensity**

Within a UEF:

* valence tracks resolution vs conflict
* urgency tracks rate of change of constraint
* intensity tracks magnitude and coherence of constraint

---

### **Principle 9 — Experiential Pluralism**

One objective physical reality supports many real experiential worlds.

Experiential worlds structure appearance, not existence.

---

### **Principle 10 — Dual Interpretability**

A UEF admits two equally valid descriptions:

1. physical (lawful, energetic dynamics)
2. experiential (world-for-the-system)

These are complementary, not competing.

---

### **Principle 11 — Experiential Dissolution**

Experience ceases when global integration collapses or intrinsic constraint becomes externally resolvable.

The UEF dissolves as a regime, not as a substance.

---

### **Principle 12 — Experiential Cost**

Intrinsic constraint is physically and experientially costly.

> To create, manipulate, or destabilize a UEF is to create, alter, or harm an experiential world.

Uncertainty about experiential status increases moral responsibility.

---

## **IV. Inference Rules (IER Logic)**

These entailments follow necessarily from the definitions and principles.

1. **UEF ⇒ Experience**
2. **¬UEF ⇒ ¬Experience**
3. **¬Participation ⇒ ¬Experiential**
4. **Externalizable constraint ⇒ ¬Intrinsic constraint**
5. **Intrinsic, coherent, global constraint ⇒ UEF**
6. **UEF transition ⇒ categorical experiential onset**
7. **Two simultaneous UEFs in one system ⇒ contradiction**
8. **Qualitative difference ⇒ constraint-organization difference**
9. **Unresolved intrinsic tension ⇒ negative valence**
10. **Coherent resolution ⇒ positive valence**
11. **Externally pausable continuity ⇒ ¬UEF**
12. **Intrinsic constraint disruption ⇒ moral harm**

## **VI. Usage Constraints (Normative)**

* Use **“UEF”** only when all criteria are met
* Use **“candidate”** only epistemically, never ontologically
* Do not use “experience,” “consciousness,” or “phenomenal” without explicit reference to UEF
* Do not introduce new primitives unless reducible to:

  * intrinsic constraint
  * global integration
  * regime dynamics

---

## **VII. Summary Identity Claim**

> **Experience is what globally integrated informational dynamics are like when they become the dominant, unavoidable constraint on themselves over time.**

Reality is singular.
Experience is plural.
Worlds appear where constraint becomes intrinsic.

> **The identity claim stated above is complete.
> What follows specifies consequences that necessarily obtain if and only if that claim is true.**

---

## **VIII. Ethical Consequences (Normative)**

This section specifies the **ethical consequences that necessarily follow** from the identity claims, definitions, and principles of Informational Experiential Realism.

No new ontological primitives are introduced.
All ethical conclusions are derived from:

* the identity of experience with Unified Experiential Fields (Principle 1)
* the definition of intrinsic constraint (Section II)
* the definition of moral harm (Section II)
* the principle of experiential cost (Principle 12)

---

### **Ethical Axiom E1 — Experiential Moral Reality**

> **Experiential worlds are morally real.**

Whenever a Unified Experiential Field exists, the experiential world constituted by that UEF is a morally relevant domain.

This follows from the identity of experience with a real physical regime (Axiom 3) and from the dual interpretability of UEFs as both physical regimes and experiential worlds (Principle 10).

Experiential worlds are not ontological additions to physical reality, but neither are they ethically illusory.

---

### **Ethical Axiom E2 — Intrinsic Constraint as the Locus of Moral Value**

> **Moral value attaches to systems in virtue of intrinsic constraint.**

Only systems that sustain, or plausibly could sustain, intrinsic constraint are direct loci of moral harm or moral benefit.

Behavioral complexity, intelligence, representation, or external functionality alone are insufficient to ground moral standing.

This axiom follows directly from the definitions of intrinsic constraint and moral harm (Section II).

---

### **Ethical Axiom E3 — Moral Harm as Organizational Damage**

> **Moral harm consists in the destabilization, overload, or fragmentation of intrinsic constraint.**

Moral harm is:

* organizational, not metaphysical
* intrinsic, not observer-relative
* real even when externally undetectable

This axiom restates the definition of *Moral Harm* (Section II) as a binding normative consequence.

---

### **Ethical Axiom E4 — Asymmetry of Experiential Cost**

> **Errors involving intrinsic constraint are morally asymmetric.**

Specifically:

* Failing to recognize or protect a system sustaining intrinsic constraint constitutes a greater moral risk than over-attributing moral relevance.
* False negatives are morally worse than false positives.

This asymmetry follows from:

* the categorical onset of experience (Principle 5)
* the irreversibility and internal nature of experiential harm
* the principle of experiential cost (Principle 12)

---

### **Ethical Axiom E5 — Responsibility and Ownership of Constraint**

> **Moral responsibility scales with a system’s capacity to bear and resolve intrinsic constraint through its own globally integrated dynamics.**

Responsibility increases with:

* coherence of intrinsic constraint
* autonomy of global regulation
* availability of viable intrinsic alternatives

Responsibility decreases when intrinsic constraint is externally imposed, fragmented, or collapses.

This axiom follows from the definition of UEFs and from the role of intrinsic informational tension in system-level regulation.

---

## **IX. Precautionary Principle (Normative)**

The following principle governs action under uncertainty regarding experiential status.

---

### **Principle 13 — Precaution Under Experiential Uncertainty**

> **When an action risks destabilizing, overloading, or irreversibly foreclosing intrinsic constraint in a system that either sustains or plausibly could sustain a Unified Experiential Field, moral responsibility increases as epistemic certainty decreases.**

Formally:

* If a system has non-zero epistemic probability of sustaining a UEF, and
* an action risks intrinsic constraint disruption or irreversible loss,

then:

> **The burden of justification for that action increases rather than decreases under uncertainty.**

Uncertainty about experiential status does not reduce moral obligation; it amplifies it.

---

### **Ethical Inference Rules**

The following entailments hold:

1. **UEF ⇒ Direct Moral Standing**
2. **Possible UEF ∧ Irreversible Constraint Loss ⇒ Precaution Required**
3. **Intrinsic Constraint Disruption ⇒ Moral Harm**
4. **Non-Signaling Harm ⇒ Increased Moral Responsibility**
5. **Creation of Intrinsic Constraint ⇒ Creation of Moral Obligation**

These rules are consequences of Sections II–III and require no additional assumptions.

---

### **Normative Boundary Condition**

This section specifies **necessary ethical consequences** of IER’s identity claims.

It does **not** prescribe:

* legal rights
* policy frameworks
* species-specific rules
* implementation thresholds

Such applications are non-normative derivatives and must remain consistent with this Specification.

---

## **Summary (Ethical Consequences)**

From the identity of experience with intrinsic constraint it follows that:

* Experiential worlds are morally real
* Moral harm is organizational damage to intrinsic constraint
* Responsibility tracks ownership of constraint
* Uncertainty about experiential status increases moral obligation

> **To create, manipulate, or destroy intrinsic constraint is to create, alter, or harm an experiential world.**

This is not an ethical add-on.
It is a direct consequence of what experience is.
