# **IER Canon (v10.8 — Reader-Aligned Revision)**

## **Canonical Structure, Authority, Alignment, and Reader-Orientation Rules of the IER Corpus**

---

## **Status and Purpose**

This document defines the **canonical structure, authority tiers, interpretive rules, global alignment constraints, and reader-orientation requirements** governing the **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** corpus as of **version 10.8**.

It specifies:

1. Which documents are **ontologically and normatively authoritative**
2. Which documents are **canon-constrained extensions**
3. Which documents are **restrictive or misuse-blocking**
4. Which documents are **explanatory or speculative**
5. The **global alignment rules** that apply across *all* tiers
6. How conflicts, ambiguities, and apparent tensions are resolved
7. **How documents must be written to avoid reader-hostility while remaining institution-hostile**

This document introduces **no new ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical claims**.

It governs **interpretation, authority, admissible language, and reader alignment**, not theory content.

---

## **General Canon Rule**

> **No document may introduce ontological, criterial, epistemic, or normative commitments unless explicitly authorized by its canon tier.**

Lower-tier documents must defer to higher-tier documents in all cases of tension or ambiguity.

Violations of canon rules are **canonical errors**, not stylistic disagreements.

---

## **Reader Alignment Principle (Global)**

IER is permitted — and in many domains intended — to be **institution-hostile**, **engineering-restrictive**, and **ethically severe**.

IER must **not** be **reader-hostile**.

**Reader-hostility** is defined canonically as:

> framing that treats the reader as an adversary, presumes misuse, assigns blame for confusion, or presents difficulty as culpable rather than structural.

All documents in all tiers must comply with the **Reader Alignment Rules** defined below.

---

# **Tier Structure**

---

## **Tier 1 — Foundational Canon (Exclusive Ontological and Normative Authority)**

These documents together define **what experience is, when it exists, and what necessarily follows from its existence** under IER.

They are jointly authoritative and mutually constraining.

### **Tier 1A — Ontology and Identity**

* **`IER-specification.md`**
  *Primary normative authority*
  Defines the identity claim, Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs), intrinsic constraint, categorical onset, subjecthood, moral standing, ethical scope, and contradiction clauses.

* **`IER-theory.md`**
  *Derivational and exclusion authority*
  Explains why weaker organizations fail and why global intrinsic constraint and single-UEF dominance are required.

---

### **Tier 1B — Regime Behavior and Formal Structure**

* **`IER-dynamics.md`**
  Governs dominance, participation modulation, coherence windows, instability, collapse, re-entry, and regime continuity.

* **`IER-math.md`**
  Fixes the formal meaning of informational orders, graph structure, regimes, coherence, choice spaces, and structural exclusions.

---

### **Tier 1C — Normative Commitments**

* **`IER-ethics.md`**
  Defines moral standing, moral harm, precaution under uncertainty, explicit ethical costs, and rejected intuitions.

No ethical claim elsewhere may override, extend, or soften this document.

---

## **Tier 2 — Canon-Constrained Analytical Extensions**

These documents are **canonical in intent but non-authoritative in definition**.

They analyze specific phenomena **strictly under Tier-1 constraints** and may not revise ontology, criteria, epistemic limits, or ethics.

They **must preserve reader alignment** explicitly.

They exist to show how a single, strict identity claim can illuminate diverse experiential phenomena without expanding the ontology or relaxing the core constraints.

### **Phenomenology, Continuity, and Mental Structure**

* `IER-continuity.md`
* `IER-persistence.md`
* `IER-brainfeels.md`
* `IER-intentionality.md`
* `IER-meaning.md`
* `IER-emotions.md`
* `IER-panic.md`
* `IER-psychosis.md`
* `IER-aphantasia.md`

### **Agency, Choice, and Action**

* `IER-agency.md`
* `IER-choice.md`
* `IER-free-will.md`
* `IER-access.md`
* `IER-slack.md`

### **Normative Analysis and Critique**

* `IER-morals.md`
* `IER-denials.md`
* `IER-critics.md`

### **Comparative and Boundary Work**

* `IER-contrast.md`
* `IER-puzzles.md`

These documents may surface tensions or costs but may not resolve them against Tier 1.

---

## **Tier 3 — Diagnostic and Constraint-Enforcing Documents**

These documents are **canon-binding in a negative sense**.

They restrict misuse, block illegitimate inference, and deny invalid extensions of IER.

They **must not** frame restriction as reader fault.

They **must** frame restriction as **structural impossibility or protection against misattribution**.

* **`IER-diagnostics.md`**  
  Explains why experience cannot be diagnosed, certified, or ruled out under IER, and why this limitation follows structurally from intrinsic constraint rather than from ignorance, methodological limits, or reader error.

**Interpretive rule:**
If a proposed application, inference, or test is ruled out by a Tier 3 document, it is ruled out **for the entire corpus**, regardless of intuitions elsewhere.

---

## **Tier 4 — Explanatory, Pedagogical, and Speculative Material**

These documents are **explicitly non-canonical**.

They introduce no authority and must defer to all higher tiers.

* `IER-canon.md`
* `IER-FAQ.md`
* `IER-futures.md`
* `IER-art.md`
* `README.md`
* `IER-changelog.md`

They are encouraged to:

* orient new readers
* soften entry
* motivate interest
* contextualize severity

---

# **Global Alignment Rules (Apply Across All Tiers)**

The following rules are **canonically binding** across *all* IER documents.

Violation constitutes a **canonical error**, even without explicit contradiction of Tier-1 claims.

---

## **G1 — Informational Language Is Always Derivative**

All uses of:

* information
* informational states
* informational tension
* informational slack
* storage, processing, or transformation of information

must be readable **exclusively** as shorthand for:

> **physically instantiated state distinctions that modulate a system’s own future dynamics under intrinsic constraint**

No informational primitives, semantic properties, representational contents, or epistemic notions may be introduced.

**Requirement:**
Every document using informational language **must include an explicit global disclaimer**, typically in its Status or Scope section, affirming this constraint.

Absence of such a disclaimer is a canon violation.

---

## **G2 — No Agentive Language in Definitions or Necessity Claims**

Agentive or value-laden language must not appear inside:

* definitions
* identity claims
* necessity conditions
* exclusion arguments

Disallowed phrases include (non-exhaustive):

* “important to the system”
* “relevant for the system”
* “the system treats as…”
* “the system values / prioritizes…”

Permissible replacements include:

* “globally constraining”
* “affects the control manifold”
* “alters admissible future trajectories”

Agentive language may appear **only** in explanatory gloss and must never function as a primitive.

---

## **G3 — Observer Is Non-Normative**

The term *observer* may appear **only** as:

* a descriptive convenience, or
* an externally imposed modeling stance

It must never carry:

* experiential authority
* epistemic authority
* ethical authority

Any document using the term *observer* must explicitly state that it is **non-normative**.

Any use of *observer* that cannot be removed without loss of meaning is presumptively invalid.

---

## **G4 — Regime Membership Is Categorical; Parameters Are Continuous**

Whenever documents discuss:

* degrees
* magnitudes
* ranges
* windows
* intensities
* coherence variation

they must **explicitly preserve the distinction** between:

* **categorical regime membership** (UEF existence, subjecthood, standing), and
* **continuous parameters** (stability, intensity, participation, vulnerability)

If a passage could reasonably be misread as implying **graded subjecthood**, it must be revised.

---

## **G5 — Experiential Structure Confers No Epistemic Authority**

Any document that discusses:

* meaning
* urgency
* salience
* narrative
* agency
* conviction
* belief
* truth-tracking

must explicitly reaffirm:

> **Experiential structure confers no epistemic authority about mind-independent reality.**

This requirement is not optional redundancy.
It is containment against revelatory, charismatic, or intuition-driven misuse.

---

## **G6 — Reader Alignment Rule (Good-Faith Presumption)**

All IER documents **must be written as if the reader is acting in good faith**.

This entails:

### **G6.1 — No Presumptive Blame**

Documents must **not**:

* presume misuse
* imply negligence
* frame misunderstanding as error of character or carelessness

Confusion must be treated as:

> **an expected result of a strong and non-intuitive identity claim**

---

### **G6.2 — Structural Framing Over Prohibitive Framing**

Wherever possible:

* Replace **“forbidden / ruled out”** with
  **“structurally impossible / unsupported by the framework”**

* Replace **“invalid inference”** with
  **“an inference the framework cannot license”**

The restriction remains identical; the alignment changes.

---

### **G6.3 — Orientation Before Enforcement**

Tier-1 and Tier-3 documents **must include an early, non-normative orientation paragraph** explaining:

* why the constraints exist
* what problem they prevent
* that the purpose is **containment of misattribution**, not discipline of the reader

This paragraph introduces **no authority** and **no new claims**.

---

### **G6.4 — Acknowledge Difficulty Without Weakening**

Where IER produces:

* frustration
* ethical discomfort
* loss of epistemic reassurance

documents **must acknowledge this explicitly** as a **cost of the identity claim**, not as reader resistance or error.

---

### **G6.5 — No Adversarial Tone Toward the Reader**

IER may be:

* adversarial toward institutions
* restrictive toward engineering
* uncompromising toward misuse

IER must **never** adopt:

* a scolding tone
* a prosecutorial voice
* a “you are doing this wrong” stance toward the reader

---

## **Conflict Resolution Order**

When documents appear to conflict:

1. Tier 1 overrides all other tiers
2. Tier 2 must defer to Tier 1
3. Tier 3 constrains misuse across all tiers
4. Tier 4 defers to all others
5. Explicit statements override inferred intentions
6. Global Alignment Rules override stylistic latitude

Appeals to intuition, example, or application may never override Tier 1 definitions or global alignment rules.

---

## **Version Discipline**

* This canon applies to **IER v10.8**
* Minor versions (v10.x) may clarify but not expand authority
* Major revisions (v11.0+) require an explicit canon update
* Deprecated planning documents are non-authoritative once their constraints are canonized

---

## **Summary**

IER v10.8 is governed by:

* a **tiered canon with exclusive normative authority**
* **structural and ethical severity by identity**
* **explicit institutional hostility where required**
* **mandatory reader alignment everywhere**

IER does not soften its claims.
It does not dilute its consequences.
It does not retreat from restriction.

But it **refuses to treat good-faith readers as adversaries**.

Institutional misuse is anticipated and constrained; individual understanding is assumed and supported.

> **IER is hard because reality is hard.
> Not because the reader is at fault.**
