# **IER Canon (v10.8 — Comprehensive Indexed Revision)**

## **Canonical Structure, Authority, Alignment, and File Index of the IER Corpus**

---

## **Status and Purpose**

This document defines the **canonical structure, authority tiers, interpretive rules, global alignment constraints, and official file index** governing the **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** corpus as of **version 10.8**.

It specifies:

1. Which documents are **ontologically and normatively authoritative**
2. Which documents are **canon-constrained analytical extensions**
3. Which documents are **restrictive or misuse-blocking**
4. Which documents are **explanatory, pedagogical, or speculative**
5. The **global alignment rules** that apply across *all* tiers
6. How conflicts, ambiguities, and apparent tensions are resolved
7. The **complete, authoritative list of files in the IER corpus**, with brief descriptions

This document introduces **no new ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical claims**.

It governs **authority, interpretation, admissible language, reader alignment, and corpus structure**, not theory content.

---

## **General Canon Rule**

> **No document may introduce ontological, criterial, epistemic, or normative commitments unless explicitly authorized by its canon tier.**

Lower-tier documents must defer to higher-tier documents in all cases of tension or ambiguity.

Violations of canon rules are **canonical errors**, not stylistic disagreements.

---

## **Reader Alignment Principle (Global)**

IER is permitted — and in many domains intended — to be:

* institution-hostile
* engineering-restrictive
* ethically severe

IER must **not** be **reader-hostile**.

**Reader-hostility** is defined canonically as:

> framing that treats the reader as an adversary, presumes misuse, assigns blame for confusion, or presents difficulty as culpable rather than structural.

All documents in all tiers must comply with the **Reader Alignment Rules** defined below.

---

# **Tier Structure and File Index**

---

## **Tier 1 — Foundational Canon**

**Exclusive Ontological and Normative Authority**

Tier-1 documents jointly define **what experience is, when it exists, and what necessarily follows from its existence** under IER.

They are **mutually constraining and jointly authoritative**.

---

### **Tier 1A — Ontology and Identity**

* **`IER-specification.md`** — The exclusive normative core of IER, defining experiential identity, Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs), intrinsic constraint, categorical onset, subjecthood, and moral standing.
* **`IER-theory.md`** — Explains why the IER identity claim requires global intrinsic constraint and why weaker organizational accounts fail.

---

### **Tier 1B — Regime Behavior and Formal Structure**

* **`IER-dynamics.md`** — Describes how Unified Experiential Fields behave over time, including dominance, participation modulation, stability, and collapse.
* **`IER-math.md`** — Formalizes IER using state spaces, transition graphs, regimes, and coherence without adding ontology or diagnostics.

---

### **Tier 1C — Normative Commitments**

* **`IER-ethics.md`** — Develops the ethical consequences that necessarily follow from experiential identity, including standing, harm, and precaution.

No ethical claim elsewhere may override or soften this document.

---

## **Tier 2 — Canon-Constrained Analytical Extensions**

Tier-2 documents analyze specific phenomena **strictly under Tier-1 constraints**. They introduce **no new criteria, ontology, epistemic access, or ethics**.

Tier-2 documents typically follow the presentation conventions described in the Global Alignment Rules.

---

### **Phenomenology, Continuity, and Mental Structure**

* **`IER-continuity.md`** — Explains how experiential gaps coexist with identity persistence under regime-based experience.
* **`IER-persistence.md`** — Accounts for deep experiential change without violating categorical subjecthood.
* **`IER-brainfeels.md`** — Analyzes endogenous, non-representational qualitative experiences as intrinsic-constraint stabilizers.
* **`IER-aphantasia.md`** — Interprets aphantasic phenomenology as a coherent experiential architecture.
* **`IER-emotions.md`** — Explains emotions as stable organizations of intrinsic constraint.
* **`IER-panic.md`** — Reinterprets panic and shutdown as regime-preserving or regime-abandoning responses.
* **`IER-psychosis.md`** — Describes psychosis as a pathological regime within a persisting UEF.
* **`IER-meaning.md`** — Explains meaning as a constraint-stabilizing organizational phenomenon.
* **`IER-intentionality.md`** — Replaces representational intentionality with a structural account grounded in intrinsic constraint.
* **`IER-sleep.md`** — Clarifies unconscious states using regime-based experience and experiential regime continuity.
* **`IER-shadows.md`** — Explains shadow figures and DMT entities as constraint-stabilizing soft attractors under extreme intrinsic constraint.
* **`IER-art.md`** — Explains art and beauty as constraint-shaping experiential structures.
* **`IER-patterns.md`** — Explains recurring natural forms using attractor dynamics.
* **`IER-attractors.md`** — Introduces soft attractors in experiential organization.
* **`IER-insight.md`** — Explains insight as a sudden reorganization of intrinsic constraint
* **`IER-types.md`** — Explains personality types as attractor-based clustering

---

### **Agency, Choice, and Action**

* **`IER-agency.md`** — Defines agency as owned resolution of intrinsic constraint within a UEF.
* **`IER-choice.md`** — Introduces Choice Spaces as structured sets of admissible futures whose traversal constitutes choice only within a UEF.
* **`IER-free-will.md`** — Dissolves the free-will debate by separating determinism from ownership.
* **`IER-access.md`** — Clarifies the separation between experiential access and epistemic authority.
* **`IER-slack.md`** — Argues that informational slack structurally prevents experience under IER.
* **`IER-social-systems.md`** — Explains how institutions matter morally without experience.
* **`IER-resolution.md`** — Distinguishes physical resolution from experiential ownership.

---

### **Normative Analysis and Critique**

* **`IER-morals.md`** — Works through concrete moral cases using IER’s distinctions.
* **`IER-denials.md`** — Explicitly lists what IER does *not* claim.

* **`IER-puzzles.md`** — Shows how classic puzzles dissolve under the IER framework.
* **`IER-dilemmas.md`** — Explains the structural misframing behind classic moral dilemmas.
* **`IER-helmets.md`** — Explains why immersive tools do not become part of a UEF.
* **`IER-gut.md`** — Explains why the enteric nervous system is not a second subject.
* **`IER-implants.md`** — Explains why neural implants reshape participation without becoming co-owners of a UEF.
* **`IER-traditions.md`** — Examines major religions by how they influence UEF constraint.

 ---

## **Tier 3 — Diagnostic and Constraint-Enforcing Documents**

Tier-3 documents are **canon-binding in a negative sense**: they restrict misuse and block illegitimate inference.

* **`IER-diagnostics.md`** — Explains why experiential diagnostics are structurally impossible under IER and why uncertainty restricts action.

If a claim is ruled out here, it is ruled out **for the entire corpus**.

---

## **Tier 4 — Explanatory, Pedagogical, and Speculative Material**

Tier-4 documents introduce **no authority** and defer to all higher tiers.

* **`IER-canon.md`** — Defines canon structure, tiers, alignment rules, and the official file index.
* **`README.md`** — High-level overview of Informational Experiential Realism.
* **`IER-FAQ.md`** — Plain-language answers to common confusions.
* **`IER-dont-panic.md`** — Explicit reassurance regarding ethical severity and reader blame.
* **`IER-strictness.md`** — Explains why IER must be unusually constrained.

## **Non-Canonical Work and Planning**

* **`_work/IER-abstracts.md`** — Central source of abstracts for corpus documents.
* **`_work/IER-future-work.md`** — Non-canonical planning notes for possible future extensions.

---

# **Global Alignment Rules (Apply Across All Tiers)**

The following rules are **canonically binding** across *all* IER documents.

Violation constitutes a **canonical error**, even without explicit contradiction of Tier-1 claims.

---

## **G1 — Informational Language Is Always Derivative**

All uses of:

* information
* informational states
* informational tension
* informational slack
* storage, processing, or transformation of information

must be readable **exclusively** as shorthand for:

> **physically instantiated state distinctions that modulate a system’s own future dynamics under intrinsic constraint**

No informational primitives, semantic properties, representational contents, or epistemic notions may be introduced.

**Requirement:**
Every document using informational language **must include an explicit global disclaimer**, typically in its Status or Scope section, affirming this constraint.

Absence of such a disclaimer is a canon violation.

---

## **G2 — No Agentive Language in Definitions or Necessity Claims**

Agentive or value-laden language must not appear inside:

* definitions
* identity claims
* necessity conditions
* exclusion arguments

Disallowed phrases include (non-exhaustive):

* “important to the system”
* “relevant for the system”
* “the system treats as…”
* “the system values / prioritizes…”

Permissible replacements include:

* “globally constraining”
* “affects the control manifold”
* “alters admissible future trajectories”

Agentive language may appear **only** in explanatory gloss and must never function as a primitive.

---

## **G3 — Observer Is Non-Normative**

The term *observer* may appear **only** as:

* a descriptive convenience, or
* an externally imposed modeling stance

It must never carry:

* experiential authority
* epistemic authority
* ethical authority

Any document using the term *observer* must explicitly state that it is **non-normative**.

Any use of *observer* that cannot be removed without loss of meaning is presumptively invalid.

---

## **G4 — Regime Membership Is Categorical; Parameters Are Continuous**

Whenever documents discuss:

* degrees
* magnitudes
* ranges
* windows
* intensities
* coherence variation

they must **explicitly preserve the distinction** between:

* **categorical regime membership** (UEF existence, subjecthood, standing), and
* **continuous parameters** (stability, intensity, participation, vulnerability)

If a passage could reasonably be misread as implying **graded subjecthood**, it must be revised.

---

## **G5 — Experiential Structure Confers No Epistemic Authority**

Any document that discusses:

* meaning
* urgency
* salience
* narrative
* agency
* conviction
* belief
* truth-tracking

must explicitly reaffirm:

> **Experiential structure confers no epistemic authority about mind-independent reality.**

This requirement is not optional redundancy.
It is containment against revelatory, charismatic, or intuition-driven misuse.

---

## **G6 — Reader Alignment Rule (Good-Faith Presumption)**

All IER documents **must be written as if the reader is acting in good faith**.

This entails:

### **G6.1 — No Presumptive Blame**

Documents must **not**:

* presume misuse
* imply negligence
* frame misunderstanding as error of character or carelessness

Confusion must be treated as:

> **an expected result of a strong and non-intuitive identity claim**

---

### **G6.2 — Structural Framing Over Prohibitive Framing**

Wherever possible:

* Replace **“forbidden / ruled out”** with
  **“structurally impossible / unsupported by the framework”**

* Replace **“invalid inference”** with
  **“an inference the framework cannot license”**

The restriction remains identical; the alignment changes.

---

### **G6.3 — Orientation Before Enforcement**

Tier-1 and Tier-3 documents **must include an early, non-normative orientation paragraph** explaining:

* why the constraints exist
* what problem they prevent
* that the purpose is **containment of misattribution**, not discipline of the reader

This paragraph introduces **no authority** and **no new claims**.

---

### **G6.4 — Acknowledge Difficulty Without Weakening**

Where IER produces:

* frustration
* ethical discomfort
* loss of epistemic reassurance

documents **must acknowledge this explicitly** as a **cost of the identity claim**, not as reader resistance or error.

---

### **G6.5 — No Adversarial Tone Toward the Reader**

IER may be:

* adversarial toward institutions
* restrictive toward engineering
* uncompromising toward misuse

IER must **never** adopt:

* a scolding tone
* a prosecutorial voice
* a “you are doing this wrong” stance toward the reader

---

## **Presentation Conventions (Non-Normative)**

Tier-2 analytical extensions and higher-form explanatory documents are **normally presented** using a standardized repo style that includes a *Status and Authority* section, an *Abstract*, and an explicit scope disclaimer. These conventions exist solely to support reader alignment, prevent accidental authority inflation, and clarify tier placement at a glance. They introduce **no ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical authority**, and their presence or absence does **not** affect a document’s canonical tier or validity. Content authority under IER is determined **exclusively** by explicit tier assignment and substantive claims, not by formatting or layout. This guidance is **advisory rather than mandatory**, and deviation does not constitute a canon violation.

---

## **Procedure for Adding or Modifying Corpus Documents**

To add a new document:

1. Create `IER-<name>.md`.
2. The document must explicitly declare:
   * its **canon tier**
   * its **status and scope**
   * its **non-authority relative to higher tiers**
   * any **required global disclaimers** appropriate to its content
3. Include a **self-contained abstract** in the document.
4. Copy the abstract **verbatim** into `_work/IER-abstracts.md`.
5. Add the document to the appropriate tier list in **this file (`IER-canon.md`)**, including a one-line description.
6. Update `README.md` if the document materially affects corpus scope or reader orientation.
7. Update `IER-changelog.md` if the change replaces, deprecates, or significantly restructures existing material.

---

## **Conflict Resolution Order**

When documents appear to conflict:

1. Tier 1 overrides all other tiers
2. Tier 2 must defer to Tier 1
3. Tier 3 constrains misuse across all tiers
4. Tier 4 defers to all others
5. Explicit statements override inferred intentions
6. Global Alignment Rules override stylistic latitude

Appeals to intuition, example, or application may never override Tier 1 definitions or global alignment rules.

---

## **Version Discipline**

* This canon applies to **IER v10.8**
* Minor versions may clarify but not expand authority
* Major revisions require an explicit canon update
* Deprecated planning documents lose authority once canonized

---

## **Summary**

IER v10.8 is governed by:

* a **tiered canon with exclusive normative authority**
* **structural and ethical severity by identity**
* **explicit institutional hostility where required**
* **mandatory reader alignment everywhere**
* a **fully indexed, explicitly governed corpus**

IER does not soften its claims.
It does not dilute its consequences.
It does not retreat from restriction.

But it **does not treat good-faith readers as adversaries**.

> **IER is hard because reality is hard.
> Not because the reader is at fault.**
