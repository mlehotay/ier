# **IER Canon (v10.8)**

## **Canonical Structure, Authority, and Alignment Rules of the IER Corpus**

---

## **Status and Purpose**

This document defines the **canonical structure, authority tiers, interpretive rules, and global alignment constraints** governing the **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** corpus as of **version 10.8**.

It specifies:

1. Which documents are **ontologically and normatively authoritative**
2. Which documents are **canon-constrained extensions**
3. Which documents are **restrictive or misuse-blocking**
4. Which documents are **explanatory or speculative**
5. The **global alignment rules** that apply across *all* tiers
6. How conflicts, ambiguities, and apparent tensions are resolved

This document introduces **no new ontological, criterial, or ethical claims**.

It governs **interpretation, authority, and admissible language**, not theory content.

---

## **General Canon Rule**

> **No document may introduce ontological, criterial, epistemic, or normative commitments unless explicitly authorized by its canon tier.**

Lower-tier documents must defer to higher-tier documents in all cases of tension or ambiguity.

Violations of canon rules are **canonical errors**, not stylistic disagreements.

---

## **Tier 1 — Foundational Canon (Exclusive Ontological and Normative Authority)**

These documents together define **what experience is, when it exists, and what necessarily follows from its existence** under IER.

They are jointly authoritative and mutually constraining.

### **Tier 1A — Ontology and Identity**

* **`IER-specification.md`**
  *Primary normative authority*
  Defines the identity claim, Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs), intrinsic constraint, categorical onset, subjecthood, moral standing, ethical scope, and contradiction clauses.

* **`IER-theory.md`**
  *Derivational and exclusion authority*
  Explains why weaker organizations fail and why global intrinsic constraint and single-UEF dominance are required.

---

### **Tier 1B — Regime Behavior and Formal Structure**

* **`IER-dynamics.md`**
  Governs dominance, participation modulation, coherence windows, instability, collapse, re-entry, and regime continuity.

* **`IER-math.md`**
  Fixes the formal meaning of informational orders, graph structure, regimes, coherence, choice spaces, and structural exclusions.

---

### **Tier 1C — Normative Commitments**

* **`IER-ethics.md`**
  Defines moral standing, moral harm, precaution under uncertainty, explicit ethical costs, and rejected intuitions.

No ethical claim elsewhere may override, extend, or soften this document.

---

## **Tier 2 — Canon-Constrained Analytical Extensions**

These documents are **canonical in intent but non-authoritative in definition**.

They analyze specific phenomena **strictly under Tier 1 constraints** and may not revise ontology, criteria, epistemic limits, or ethics.

### **Phenomenology, Continuity, and Mental Structure**

* `IER-continuity.md`
* `IER-persistence.md`
* `IER-brainfeels.md`
* `IER-intentionality.md`
* `IER-meaning.md`
* `IER-emotions.md`
* `IER-panic.md`
* `IER-psychosis.md`
* `IER-aphantasia.md`

### **Agency, Choice, and Action**

* `IER-agency.md`
* `IER-choice.md`
* `IER-free-will.md`
* `IER-access.md`
* `IER-slack.md`

### **Normative Analysis and Critique**

* `IER-morals.md`
* `IER-denials.md`
* `IER-critics.md`

### **Comparative and Boundary Work**

* `IER-contrast.md`
* `IER-puzzles.md`

These documents may surface tensions or costs but may not resolve them against Tier 1.

---

## **Tier 3 — Diagnostic and Constraint-Enforcing Documents**

These documents are **canon-binding in a negative sense**.

They restrict misuse, block illegitimate inference, and deny invalid extensions of IER.

They do **not** grant positive criteria, diagnostics, or detection methods.

* **`IER-diagnostics.md`**

**Interpretive rule:**
If a proposed application, inference, or test is ruled out by a Tier 3 document, it is ruled out **for the entire corpus**, regardless of intuitions elsewhere.

---

## **Tier 4 — Explanatory, Pedagogical, and Speculative Material**

These documents are **explicitly non-canonical**.

They introduce no authority and must defer to all higher tiers.

* `IER-canon.md`
* `IER-FAQ.md`
* `IER-futures.md`
* `IER-art.md`
* `README.md`
* `IER-changelog.md`

They exist to explain, orient, or explore implications without normative force.

---

## **Global Alignment Rules (Apply Across All Tiers)**

The following rules are **canonically binding** across *all* IER documents, including non-normative and explanatory material.

Violation of these rules constitutes a **canonical error**, even if no explicit contradiction with Tier 1 occurs.

---

### **G1 — Informational Language Is Always Derivative**

All uses of:

* information
* informational states
* informational tension
* informational slack
* storage, processing, or transformation of information

must be readable **exclusively** as shorthand for:

> **physically instantiated state distinctions that modulate a system’s own future dynamics under intrinsic constraint**

No informational primitives, semantic properties, representational contents, or epistemic notions may be introduced.

**Requirement:**
Every document using informational language **must include an explicit global disclaimer**, typically in its Status or Scope section, affirming this constraint.

Absence of such a disclaimer is a canon violation.

---

### **G2 — No Agentive Language in Definitions or Necessity Claims**

Agentive or value-laden language must not appear inside:

* definitions
* identity claims
* necessity conditions
* exclusion arguments

Disallowed phrases include (non-exhaustive):

* “important to the system”
* “relevant for the system”
* “the system treats as…”
* “the system values / prioritizes…”

Permissible replacements include:

* “globally constraining”
* “affects the control manifold”
* “alters admissible future trajectories”

Agentive language may appear **only** in explanatory gloss and must never function as a primitive.

---

### **G3 — Observer Is Non-Normative**

The term *observer* may appear **only** as:

* a descriptive convenience, or
* an externally imposed modeling stance

It must never carry:

* experiential authority
* epistemic authority
* ethical authority

Any document using the term *observer* must explicitly state that it is **non-normative**.

Any use of *observer* that cannot be removed without loss of meaning is presumptively invalid.

---

### **G4 — Regime Membership Is Categorical; Parameters Are Continuous**

Whenever documents discuss:

* degrees
* magnitudes
* ranges
* windows
* intensities
* coherence variation

they must **explicitly preserve the distinction** between:

* **categorical regime membership** (UEF existence, subjecthood, standing), and
* **continuous parameters** (stability, intensity, participation, vulnerability)

If a passage could reasonably be misread as implying **graded subjecthood**, it must be revised.

---

### **G5 — Experiential Structure Confers No Epistemic Authority**

Any document that discusses:

* meaning
* urgency
* salience
* narrative
* agency
* conviction
* belief
* truth-tracking

must explicitly reaffirm:

> **Experiential structure confers no epistemic authority about mind-independent reality.**

This requirement is not optional redundancy.
It is containment against revelatory, charismatic, or intuition-driven misuse.

---

## **Conflict Resolution Order**

When documents appear to conflict:

1. Tier 1 overrides all other tiers
2. Tier 2 must defer to Tier 1
3. Tier 3 constrains misuse across all tiers
4. Tier 4 defers to all others
5. Explicit statements override inferred intentions
6. Global Alignment Rules override stylistic or explanatory latitude

Appeals to intuition, example, or application may never override Tier 1 definitions or global alignment rules.

---

## **Version Discipline**

* This canon applies to **IER v10.8**
* Minor versions (v10.x) may clarify but not expand authority
* Major revisions (v11.0+) require an explicit canon update
* Deprecated planning documents are non-authoritative once their constraints are canonized

---

## **Summary**

IER v10.8 is governed by a **tiered canon with global alignment enforcement**:

* **Tier 1** defines ontology, structure, dynamics, and ethics
* **Tier 2** analyzes phenomena under strict constraint
* **Tier 3** blocks misuse and illegitimate inference
* **Tier 4** explains and speculates without authority
* **Global Alignment Rules** prevent linguistic, epistemic, and agentive drift

All valid IER claims must be:

1. traceable to Tier 1,
2. compliant with Tier 3 constraints, and
3. aligned with G1–G5.
