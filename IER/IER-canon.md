# **IER Canon (v10.8)**

## **Canonical Structure and Authority of the IER Corpus**

---

## **Purpose of This Document**

This document defines the **canonical structure, authority tiers, and interpretive rules** governing the IER corpus as of **version 10.8**.

It specifies:

1. Which documents are **ontologically and normatively authoritative**
2. Which documents are **canon-constrained extensions**
3. Which documents are **explanatory, illustrative, or speculative**
4. How apparent conflicts are to be resolved

This document introduces **no new claims** and does not revise any other file.

---

## **General Canon Rule**

> **No document may introduce ontological, criterial, or normative commitments unless explicitly authorized by its canon tier.**

Lower-tier documents must defer to higher-tier documents in all cases of tension or ambiguity.

---

## **Tier 1 — Foundational Canon (Ontological & Normative Authority)**

These documents together define **what experience is, when it exists, and what follows ethically** under IER.

They are jointly authoritative and mutually constraining.

### **Tier 1A — Ontology and Identity**

* `IER-specification.md`
  *Primary ontological authority*
  Defines the identity claim, Unified Experiential Fields, physical information, necessity conditions, scope limits, and contradiction clauses.

* `IER-theory.md`
  *Derivational and exclusion authority*
  Establishes why weaker structures fail and why global intrinsic constraint and single-UEF dominance are required.

---

### **Tier 1B — Regime Behavior and Formal Structure**

* `IER-dynamics.md`
  Governs dominance, participation modulation, coherence windows, collapse, re-entry, and temporal continuity.

* `IER-math.md`
  Fixes the formal meaning of orders of information, graph structure, regimes, coherence, choice spaces, and structural exclusions.

---

### **Tier 1C — Normative Commitments**

* `IER-ethics.md`
  Defines moral standing, precaution scope limits, explicit ethical costs, and rejected intuitions.

No ethical claim elsewhere may override or extend this document.

---

## **Tier 2 — Canon-Constrained Analytical Extensions**

These documents are **canonical in intent** but **non-authoritative in definition**.

They analyze specific phenomena *under the constraints of Tier 1* and may not revise ontology, criteria, or ethics.

### **Phenomenology, Continuity, and Mental Structure**

* `IER-continuity.md`
* `IER-persistence.md`
* `IER-brainfeels.md`
* `IER-intentionality.md`
* `IER-meaning.md`
* `IER-emotions.md`
* `IER-panic.md`
* `IER-psychosis.md`
* `IER-aphantasia.md`

### **Agency, Choice, and Action**

* `IER-agency.md`
* `IER-choice.md`
* `IER-free-will.md`
* `IER-access.md`
* `IER-slack.md`

### **Normative Analysis and Critique**

* `IER-morals.md`
* `IER-denials.md`
* `IER-critics.md`

### **Comparative and Boundary Work**

* `IER-contrast.md`
* `IER-puzzles.md`

These documents may surface tensions or costs but may not resolve them against Tier 1.

---

## **Tier 3 — Diagnostic and Constraint-Enforcing Documents**

These documents are **canon-binding in a negative sense**:
they **restrict misuse**, **block invalid inferences**, and **deny illegitimate extensions** of IER.

They do not grant positive criteria or detection methods.

* `IER-diagnostics.md`

**Interpretive rule:**
If a proposed application, test, or inference is ruled out by `IER-diagnostics.md`, it is ruled out *for the entire corpus*, regardless of intuitions elsewhere.

This file is *not* illustrative and *not* speculative; it is a **constraint document**.

---

## **Tier 4 — Explanatory, Pedagogical, and Speculative Material**

These documents are **explicitly non-canonical**.
They introduce no authority and must defer to all higher tiers.

* `IER-canon.md`
* `IER-FAQ.md`
* `IER-futures.md`
* `IER-art.md`
* `README.md`
* `IER-changelog.md`


They exist to explain, orient, or explore implications without normative force.

---

## **Conflict Resolution Order**

When documents appear to conflict:

1. Tier 1 overrides all other tiers
2. Tier 2 must defer to Tier 1
3. Tier 3 constrains misuse across all tiers
4. Tier 4 defers to all others
5. Explicit statements override inferred intentions

No appeal to intuition, example, or application may override a Tier 1 definition.

---

## **Version Discipline**

* This canon applies to **IER v10.8**
* Minor versions (v10.x) may clarify but not expand authority
* Major revisions (v11.0+) require an explicit canon update
* Deprecated material remains historically accessible but non-authoritative

---

## **Summary**

IER v10.8 is governed by a **tiered canon**:

* **Tier 1** defines ontology, structure, dynamics, and ethics
* **Tier 2** analyzes phenomena under those constraints
* **Tier 3** blocks misuse and illegitimate inference
* **Tier 4** explains and speculates without authority

All valid IER claims must be traceable to Tier 1 and survive Tier 3 constraints.
