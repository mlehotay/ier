## **A Speculative Scenario: Living With Experiential Uncertainty**

---

## **Status and Authority**

**This document is NON-NORMATIVE and SPECULATIVE.**

It:

* introduces no new primitives
* introduces no criteria for experience
* introduces no diagnostic methods
* introduces no ethical rules

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in the IER Specification.

This article explores a **possible future cultural trajectory**: how ordinary human practices and attitudes *might plausibly evolve* **if Informational Experiential Realism were widely understood and taken seriously**, while remaining agnostic about the actual distribution of experience in the world.

Nothing in this document claims that such a future will occur, should occur, or ought to be enforced.

If any statement here conflicts with the Specification, the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void.

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identifies experience with a specific kind of physically instantiated, globally integrated dynamical regime. Where such a regime exists, experiential standing is **categorical and non-comparable**. At the same time, IER entails persistent **epistemic uncertainty** about where such regimes are instantiated, particularly in biological systems.

This article is a **thought experiment about a possible future**: one in which IER’s core claims are broadly accepted as a background ontology, even while uncertainty about particular cases remains unresolved.

The central claim is not that moral life would be radically transformed, but that certain **forms of moral confidence and dismissal would gradually become harder to sustain**, while everyday practices continue under conditions of acknowledged uncertainty.

## **1. A Future Framed as a Possibility, Not a Program**

This article does not describe a plan, reform agenda, or moral directive.

It describes a **plausible cultural adjustment** that could occur if:

* experience were widely understood as physically real by identity, and
* certainty about its distribution were recognized as unavailable in principle.

In this scenario:

* no new authorities are created
* no moral enforcement mechanisms appear
* no consensus about “who experiences” is achieved

What changes is not policy, but **background assumptions**.

## **2. Standing Without Ranking (If Experience Exists)**

In this speculative future, one feature of IER is taken seriously early:

Where experience exists, experiential standing is **categorical**.

This means:

* no experiential subject is “worth more” than another
* species membership does not determine value
* intelligence, usefulness, or similarity to humans does not alter standing

IER therefore rejects, in principle:

* species hierarchies
* moral scalarization of experience
* treating one subject’s harm as less real than another’s

This does **not** imply identical treatment.
It implies non-comparability of worth.

## **3. Animals as the Plausible Domain of Moral Attention**

In this future scenario, most people do **not** conclude that all living systems experience.

Instead, a broadly shared, cautious view stabilizes:

* many animals plausibly instantiate experiential regimes
* others plausibly do not
* boundaries remain unclear and contested

IER supplies no diagnostic tool to resolve this uncertainty, and in this scenario, that limitation is accepted rather than resisted.

The practical effect is modest:

* animals are treated as morally real subjects
* exclusions are made carefully rather than confidently
* debate shifts from certainty to justification

No universal expansion occurs.
No metaphysical line is redrawn with confidence.

## **4. Equal Standing Does Not Mean Identical Treatment**

A key distinction becomes more explicit in this imagined future:

* **Standing** answers *who counts at all*
* **Treatment** answers *what can be done in context*

Even with equal standing:

* organisms eat
* interventions occur
* harms happen under necessity

IER blocks only one move:

> denying that harm matters by denying that the subject matters.

It does not block action.
It blocks dismissal.

## **5. Practice Changes by Clarification, Not Prohibition**

In this scenario, familiar practices continue:

* medicine
* agriculture
* research
* infrastructure

What gradually disappears is a style of justification that relies on:

> “This doesn’t really count.”

Instead, harms are framed as:

* sometimes necessary
* sometimes tragic
* sometimes unavoidable

This does not introduce new rules.
It alters the moral *tone* under which decisions are defended.

---

## **6. Tradeoffs Without Ranking**

Food systems, research practices, and everyday choices still involve tradeoffs.

In this possible future:

* no subject is treated as disposable
* no harm is treated as unreal
* no life is ranked as “less worth protecting”

Tradeoffs are acknowledged as structural features of biological existence, not as evidence that some beings matter less.

---

## **7. Why This Scenario Does Not Drift Toward Extremism**

Extremism typically requires:

* absolute prohibitions
* moral purity standards
* enforceable criteria
* confidence about boundaries

IER forbids all of these.

In this future:

* there are no experience detectors
* no moral algorithms
* no authoritative rankings
* no mechanism for closing disagreement

Ethics remains slow, contextual, and fallible.

## **8. Cultural Effects: Quiet Recalibration**

If this future unfolded, the changes would likely be subtle:

* language becomes more conditional
* moral certainty softens
* dismissive arguments lose force
* unresolved tradeoffs become more openly acknowledged

There is no revolution.
No collapse.
No new moral elite.

Just fewer claims of obvious moral insignificance.

## **9. Living With Uncertainty as a Stable Condition**

The psychological posture that stabilizes in this scenario is simple:

> Acting in a world where
> some harms are unavoidable,
> some boundaries are unknowable,
> and no subject’s standing is negotiable.

This is not despair.
It is not radicalism.

It is ethical life conducted without metaphysical shortcuts.

---

## **10. Conclusion**

This article describes **one possible future** among many.

It does not claim that:

* all living systems experience
* uncertainty can be resolved
* moral life must be transformed

It explores what might happen if:

* experience were taken seriously where it plausibly exists, and
* uncertainty were treated as a permanent feature rather than a temporary defect.

In such a future:

* animals still matter
* no species is ranked as worth more than another
* action continues under necessity

What fades is the habit of treating inconvenient lives as morally unreal simply because certainty is unavailable.
