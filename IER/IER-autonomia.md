## **0. Status, Scope, and Canon Position**

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It introduces:

* no new ontological primitives
* no criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics
* no medical, clinical, or therapeutic guidance

It does **not** define, adjudicate, or diagnose medical conditions (including dysautonomia, menopause, or related categories).

All ontological, criterial, epistemic, and ethical authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md
IER-dynamics.md
```

This article applies **only conditional on the existence of a Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.
If no UEF exists, nothing described here is experiential.

**Purpose of this document:**

> To explain experiences commonly grouped under *autonomia* as cases in which **autonomic regulation becomes experientially dominant, unstable, or persistently salient** within an already-existing **Unified Experiential Field**, without implying loss of ownership, subjecthood, or experiential unity.

## **1. Orientation: Why Autonomia Is Structurally Confusing**

Experiences labeled as “autonomic” are often described as:

* the body “taking over”
* loss of control
* internal chaos
* something happening *without* the self

Common reports include:

* heart rate changes
* flushing or chills
* sweating or temperature swings
* dizziness or weakness
* nausea or gut urgency
* shaking or trembling

These experiences are distressing not only because they are uncomfortable, but because they **disrupt agency while remaining unavoidable**.

This creates pressure toward misinterpretations:

* “My body is acting independently”
* “I’m losing control”
* “Something else is running things”

IER rejects these framings.

The confusion arises not from fragmentation of experience, but from **a shift in which forms of intrinsic constraint dominate experiential organization**.

---

## **2. What Autonomia Is Not**

IER explicitly blocks several common misframings.

Autonomia is **not**:

* a separate bodily intelligence
* a “lower brain” takeover
* an unconscious agent
* a failure of attention or will
* a sign of divided or partial subjecthood

It does **not** imply:

* weakened experience
* diminished ownership
* reduced moral standing
* loss of identity

Autonomic dominance challenges **control**, not **unity**.

## **3. Autonomic Regulation Under Informational Experiential Realism**

### **3.1 Autonomic Processes as Constraint Management**

Autonomic processes regulate:

* circulation
* temperature
* digestion
* baseline arousal
* energy distribution

Under IER, these processes are not controllers, agents, or observers.
They are **participation patterns** that manage intrinsic cost at the level of the whole system.

When recruited, they impose **globally binding constraint** within the Unified Experiential Field.

---

### **3.2 Backgrounding and Foregrounding**

In most experiential regimes:

* autonomic regulation is backgrounded
* it shapes experience without demanding attention

In autonomia-type experiences:

* autonomic regulation becomes **foregrounded**
* bodily viability becomes the primary organizing constraint

This is a **salience shift**, not a change in subjecthood.

---

## **4. Autonomia as a Dominance Shift in Constraint**

### **4.1 When Regulation Becomes the Main Organizer**

Autonomia involves:

* disproportionate recruitment of autonomic participation
* narrowing of admissible futures toward stabilization and survival
* reduced availability of agentive resolution

Cognition, planning, and choice are not removed — they are **constrained by the priority of regulation**.

Agency narrows because **resolution space narrows**, not because experience weakens.

---

### **4.2 Instability and Oscillation**

Many autonomia experiences exhibit:

* overshoot and correction
* alternating sympathetic and parasympathetic dominance
* rhythmic or episodic recurrence

Structurally, these reflect **dynamic instability**, not error or malfunction.

An unstable pattern may temporarily stabilize as a **low-cost oscillatory regime**, persisting until global conditions change.

---

## **5. Major Patterns of Autonomia Experience**

### **5.1 Transient Autonomic Dominance**

Short-lived episodes may include:

* vasovagal responses
* chills or shivers
* flushing
* sudden heart rate changes
* post-urination shivering
* post-orgasm shaking or goosebumps

These are brief **spikes of autonomic dominance** that resolve once competing participation patterns reassert coherence.

---

### **5.2 Persistent or Recurrent Autonomia**

Some experiences involve sustained or frequently recurring dominance, such as:

* ongoing temperature dysregulation
* baseline shakiness or tremor
* orthostatic intolerance
* chronic nausea or gut instability
* exertion intolerance

Here, autonomic participation occupies a **disproportionate share of experiential bandwidth**, even when no acute episode is present.

---

### **5.3 Hormonal Transition–Associated Autonomia**

Certain life transitions alter autonomic calibration, including:

* perimenopause and menopause
* puberty
* postpartum periods

For example, menopausal hot flashes involve:

* sudden vasodilation
* sweating
* heart rate acceleration
* chills after resolution

Under IER, these are **autonomic heat-dumping reflexes** driven by altered regulatory thresholds, not emotional dysregulation or panic.

They exemplify oscillation and overshoot within an intact Unified Experiential Field.

---

### **5.4 Dysautonomia (Medical Umbrella, IER-Neutral)**

*Dysautonomia* is a medical umbrella term describing **persistent failure of autonomic backgrounding** across contexts.

IER treats this as:

* a descriptive category over symptom patterns
* not a different experiential ontology
* not a change in subjecthood or ownership

Dysautonomia names **frequency, persistence, and severity**, not a different kind of experience.

---

## **6. Ownership Without Control**

### **6.1 Why Autonomia Feels Alien**

Autonomia experiences feel foreign because they are:

* unavoidable
* not agentively authored
* bodily dominant

Under IER:

* ownership tracks **where intrinsic constraint is borne**
* not who initiated the process

Thus, autonomic dominance can feel alien **while remaining intrinsically owned**.

Alienation arises from **authorship mismatch**, not loss of self.

---

### **6.2 Modulation, Suppression, and Limits**

Some autonomic effects may be partially modulated via:

* breathing patterns
* posture
* pacing
* attentional redirection

Modulation depends on:

* available informational slack
* competitive participation recruitment

Failure to modulate does **not** imply failure of will, self, or agency.

---

## **7. Relationship to Other IER Phenomena**

Autonomia intersects with — but does not collapse into — other experiential patterns:

* **IER-panic** — extreme sympathetic dominance
* **IER-hiccups** — localized oscillatory instability
* **IER-spoons** — constraint-capacity exhaustion
* **IER-sleep** — recalibration and restoration

Autonomia often co-occurs with these, but represents **dominance of regulation itself**, not a distinct subject or regime.

---

## **8. Identity, Agency, and Standing Under Autonomia**

Autonomia does **not**:

* fragment experience
* diminish subjecthood
* reduce moral standing
* interrupt experiential continuity

The Unified Experiential Field remains singular and intact.

Autonomia demonstrates a central IER principle:

> Experience can reorganize around survival and regulation without ceasing to be unified, owned, or morally real.

## **9. Structural Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* Autonomia names **experiential dominance of autonomic constraint**
* It involves:

  * salience shifts
  * narrowed agency
  * instability or oscillation
* It does **not** involve:

  * subject fragmentation
  * loss of ownership
  * diminished experience

Autonomia shows how a Unified Experiential Field may be **fully itself while temporarily governed by regulation rather than choice**.

## **Intermission — Structural Fact**

> **When autonomic regulation dominates experience, agency narrows — but unity, ownership, and standing remain intact.**
