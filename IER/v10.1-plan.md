Excellent — this is exactly the right moment to do a **v10.1 architectural pass** rather than a conceptual revision.

Below is a **concrete, implementation-ready v10.1 plan** designed to:

* preserve **100% of v10.0 commitments**
* eliminate structural redundancy
* harden the Spec’s authority
* prevent future core inflation

This is written as a **change plan**, not commentary.

# IER v10.1 — Architectural Consolidation Plan

> **Scope:**
> v10.1 introduces **no new primitives, claims, or entailments**.
> It is a **structural, editorial, and role-clarification release only**.

---

## 0. Global v10.1 Rules (Apply to All Documents)

These are **non-negotiable corpus constraints**.

### G1. Authority Rule

* **IER-specification.md** is the *only* document that:

  * defines experience
  * defines UEF
  * specifies criteria
  * carries normative force

All other documents must:

* explicitly self-label as **non-normative**
* reference the Spec for any necessity claim

---

### G2. Necessity Language Ban (Outside Spec)

Outside the Spec, prohibit:

* “iff”
* “necessary and sufficient”
* “only when”
* “defines”
* “grounds”

Replace with:

* “under IER”
* “given the Spec”
* “corresponds to”
* “is explained as”

---

### G3. No Re-Derivation Rule

No document other than the Spec may:

* re-derive ethical axioms
* restate regime criteria
* reconstruct the coherent constraint window

They may **explain**, never **establish**.

---

## 1. IER-specification.md (v10.1)

**Status:** Canonical core
**Change type:** Minimal tightening only

### 1.1 Add Explicit Normative Boundary Banner (Top of File)

Add a short boxed statement:

> **Normative Boundary Condition**
> This document exhaustively specifies the ontology, criteria, and ethical entailments of IER v10.x.
> No claim outside this document carries definitional or normative authority.

(This formalizes what is already true.)

---

### 1.2 No Structural Changes Elsewhere

* Definitions, principles, inference rules remain untouched
* Section VIII–IX remain the *only* source of ethical normativity

---

## 2. IER-theory.md → **“Conceptual Overview”** (v10.1)

**Status:** Explanatory spine
**Change type:** Pruning + role sharpening

---

### 2.1 Title and Status Update

Change subtitle to:

> **Conceptual Overview and Explanatory Integration**

Add to status block:

> This document introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or normative claims**.
> All necessity claims defer to the IER v10.1 Specification.

---

### 2.2 Section-Level Edits

#### REMOVE or COMPRESS

| Section                  | Action                                        |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| §8 Categorical Onset     | Compress (reference Spec only)                |
| §11 Affect               | Keep phenomenology, remove necessity language |
| §14 Ethical Significance | Reduce to **1 paragraph + pointer**           |

---

### 2.3 What Theory Uniquely Owns After v10.1

Theory becomes the **sole owner** of:

* Why observerhood ≠ experience
* Why computation ≠ experience
* Dual description as hard-problem dissolver
* Experiential pluralism (non-normative framing)

No other document should explain these from first principles.

---

## 3. IER-math.md → **“Formal Interpretation”** (v10.1)

**Status:** Interpretive formalization
**Change type:** Clarification + constraint tightening

---

### 3.1 Add Strong Interpretation Disclaimer (Top)

Add immediately after Status:

> This document provides **mathematical interpretations** of regimes defined in the IER Specification.
> It does **not** define diagnostic criteria, thresholds, or sufficiency conditions for experience.

---

### 3.2 Language Edits (Targeted)

Replace any phrasing that implies:

* “experience exists when…”
* “UEF exists if…”

with:

* “corresponds to…”
* “models the regime in which…”
* “is consistent with the Spec-defined UEF”

---

### 3.3 Explicit Prohibition Section (New, Short)

Add a brief section:

> **What This Formalism Does Not Do**
>
> * does not detect experience
> * does not measure moral standing
> * does not define thresholds
> * does not establish sufficiency

This future-proofs against misuse.

---

## 4. IER-ethics.md → **“Ethical Consequences and Applications”** (v10.1)

**Status:** Explanatory + applied
**Change type:** Reframing, not content removal

---

### 4.1 Status Clarification (Critical)

Revise status block to say:

> All normative force is exhausted by the IER v10.1 Specification.
> This document **does not derive new obligations**, but explains how Spec-defined ethical commitments manifest in agency, responsibility, and applied contexts.

---

### 4.2 Structural Split (Lightweight)

Add explicit internal headers:

* **Part I — Ethical Consequences (Explanatory)**
* **Part II — Agency and Responsibility**
* **Part III — Applied Domains (Non-Normative)**

This makes application vs entailment unambiguous.

---

### 4.3 Language Discipline

Replace any phrasing that sounds like:

* “IER entails that we must…”
* “therefore one ought…”

with:

* “Under the Spec’s commitments…”
* “This implies heightened moral risk when…”

---

## 5. Cross-Document Hygiene Tasks (Required)

### 5.1 Citation Discipline Pass

* Every definition → Spec §II citation
* Every ethical necessity → Spec §VIII–IX citation
* Every regime claim → Spec §III citation

---

### 5.2 Duplicate Explanation Removal

Delete or condense:

* repeated UEF disclaimers
* repeated coherent constraint window explanations
* repeated ethical derivations

Target: **one explanation per concept per role**.

---

## 6. New Meta-Document (Optional but Strongly Recommended)

### **“How to Read the IER Corpus (v10.1)”**

One page.

Includes:

* document roles
* authority hierarchy
* what each document is *for*
* what it explicitly is *not for*

This prevents misreading by future readers and collaborators.

---

## 7. Versioning and Changelog

Label release:

> **IER v10.1 — Structural Consolidation Release**

Changelog should explicitly state:

* No new claims
* No modified definitions
* No altered ethical commitments
* Architecture only

---

## 8. Success Criteria (You’ll Know v10.1 Worked If…)

* No document outside the Spec can be quoted to *define* experience
* Math cannot be misread as a detector
* Ethics cannot be mistaken for adding obligations
* Theory reads as a single, clean conceptual narrative
* Readers stop asking “which document is authoritative?”

---

If you want next, I can:

* produce **exact diff-level edit instructions** per file
* draft the **“How to Read the IER Corpus”** document
* or create a **v10.1 compliance checklist** for future additions
