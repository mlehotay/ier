## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) is a realist, physicalist framework for understanding observers and lived experience. It holds that reality exists independently of observation and that experience is neither fundamental nor illusory, but a **real emergent phenomenon arising from specific forms of informational organization** instantiated in physical systems.

IER identifies experience with the **globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential informational dynamics** of a system that sustains a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**. Experience is not something a system *has*; it is **what a system is doing from the inside when certain informational processes are bound together into a unified, irreducible field of activity**.

IER rejects mind-dependent ontology, panpsychism, and dualism while remaining substrate-agnostic. It is an organizational identity theory: it specifies *what experience is* and *when it occurs*, without privileging any particular biological or material implementation.

## **1. Objective Reality**

Reality exists independently of observation. Physical states, events, and laws unfold whether or not they are experienced. Observers do not create, collapse, or co-author reality; only **physical interactions among systems** have causal effect. Experience interprets reality but does not alter it.

This realist stance establishes the baseline assumption of IER: experience is a property of **organization within reality**, not a separate ontological layer. Many physical systems evolve dynamically, but without the appropriate informational organization, there is nothing it is like to be them.

## **2. Observers as Informational Systems**

An **observer** is defined by informational organization rather than by biology or phenomenology. A system qualifies as an observer if it:

* Persists as a coherent informational pattern over time
* Integrates information across internal subsystems
* Maintains internal models of both external conditions and its own state
* Regulates behavior using those models via a unified control structure

Observerhood does **not** entail experience. Many systems observe, predict, and regulate without sustaining a unified experiential field.

---

## **3. Internal Models and Perspective**

Observers construct **internal informational models** of the world and of themselves. These models are physically instantiated and shaped by the system’s structure, history, and constraints. Perspective therefore **emerges from organization**, not from reality itself.

Different observers may model the same environment differently, but these differences do not alter objective reality. They alter only how the system regulates itself.

Internal models are necessary for adaptive behavior, but they are **not sufficient for experience**. Only those informational processes that are globally integrated into a unified field of system-wide activity contribute to what-it-is-like-for-the-system.

---

## **4. The Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**

### **4.1 Definition**

**The Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** is the globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential pattern of informational dynamics sustained by a system, in which multiple informational processes are bound together into a single, unified field of activity that is directly available for system-wide regulation.

UEF is:

* **Not a place**
* **Not a module**
* **Not a separate ontological layer**
* **Not a state the system enters**

UEF is an **organizational and dynamical achievement** of a system.

---

### **4.2 Experiential Participation**

Not all informational activity in a system contributes to experience.

An informational process **participates in the UEF** if and only if it:

* Is globally integrated with other participating processes
* Contributes to the system’s unified, temporally continuous dynamics
* Is available to system-wide regulation, learning, and control
* Is internally sustained rather than externally imposed

Processes that remain local, modular, transient, or externally orchestrated do **not** participate in the UEF and are therefore non-experiential.

---

### **4.3 Identity Claim**

> **What a system experiences is identical to the structure and dynamics of the informational processes that participate in its Unified Experiential Field.**

No additional property, substance, or inner observer exists. The field’s **patterns of tension, flow, and salience just are what-it-is-like for the system**.

---

## **5. Qualia**

Qualia are **differences in the structure of UEF-participating dynamics**. There is no separate “redness,” “painfulness,” or “warmth” beyond these patterns.

For example, the experience of red corresponds to a distinct configuration of globally integrated informational tensions and flows that differentiates it from other configurations such as green or blue. The qualitative character lies entirely in the structure of the field.

---

## **6. Affect and Valence**

Affective states arise because the UEF is not neutral. Its dynamics encode **priorities, tensions, and equilibria** relevant to regulation.

Valence reflects how the field is shaped by system-wide pressures toward or away from particular states. Urgency, desire, and aversion emerge because the system’s unified dynamics weight some informational patterns as more stabilizing or destabilizing than others.

Affect is therefore intrinsic to the field’s organization, not an added ingredient.

---

## **7. Emergence and the “Hard Problem”**

Experience is emergent but constrained. It arises only in systems capable of sustaining a UEF through their own integrated dynamics.

Asking why such dynamics “feel like something” is a category mistake. The “feeling” is not an extra fact layered on top of the dynamics; it **is what those dynamics are like when they are unified, self-referential, and temporally continuous**.

## **8. System Taxonomy (v9.0)**

| **System Type**                    | **Observerhood** | **UEF Possible** | **Experience Likelihood** | **Examples**                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Non-informational physical systems | ❌                | ❌                | ❌                         | Rocks, stars                 |
| Dynamically complex non-observers  | ❌                | ❌                | ❌                         | Storms, flames               |
| Reactive informational systems     | ❌                | ❌                | ❌                         | Thermostats                  |
| Distributed adaptive systems       | ⚠️               | ❌                | ❌                         | Ant colonies, immune systems |
| Minimal observers                  | ✅ (limited)      | ⚠️               | Low–Indeterminate         | Bees, simple robots          |
| Integrated biological observers    | ✅                | ✅                | Moderate–High             | Octopi, corvids              |
| Complex experiential observers     | ✅                | ✅                | High                      | Humans, dolphins             |
| Artificial observer systems        | ✅                | ❌–⚠️             | Indeterminate             | Advanced AI                  |
| Aggregate social systems           | ❌                | ❌                | ❌                         | Markets, institutions        |

Observerhood and experience remain distinct: experience requires observerhood, but not all observers sustain a UEF.

---

## **9. Artificial Systems and Empirical Underdetermination**

IER is substrate-agnostic. Any system—biological or artificial—that sustains a UEF through its own internally integrated dynamics would have experience.

Whether current or future AI systems meet this criterion is an empirical and architectural question, not a definitional one. Functional behavior alone is insufficient; the decisive factor is **UEF participation**.

---

## **10. Ontological Commitments**

IER affirms the following:

* **One objective physical reality** that exists independently of observers or experience.
* **Experience as a system-relative phenomenon**, occurring only in systems with the appropriate informational organization.
* **An identity (not a causal relation) between experience and a system’s globally integrated informational dynamics**, such that there is no additional substance, property, or inner observer beyond those dynamics themselves.

Accordingly, IER rejects mind-dependent ontology, substance dualism, and panpsychism. Experience is neither fundamental nor ubiquitous; it arises only where the relevant organizational conditions are met.

---

## **11. Relation to Contemporary Theories**

* **Integrated Information Theory (IIT):** Emphasizes integration; IER adds architectural participation and self-sustaining dynamics.
* **Global Workspace Theory (GWT):** Emphasizes access; IER identifies experience with the intrinsic structure of global dynamics.
* **Predictive Processing (PP):** Emphasizes internal modeling; IER constrains which modeling processes contribute to experience.

IER synthesizes these insights while maintaining a strict identity between experience and **UEF-participating dynamics**.

---

## **12. Summary**

Some systems react.
Some systems observe.
Some systems sustain a unified experiential field.

> **Experience is not something a system has; it is what a system is doing when its informational dynamics are globally integrated into a unified, temporally continuous, self-referential field.**

It feels the way it does because **that is what those dynamics are like from the inside**—nothing more, nothing less.
