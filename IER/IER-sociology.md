## **Three Possible Futures Under Experiential Uncertainty**

---

## **Status and Authority**

**This document is NON-NORMATIVE and SPECULATIVE.**

It:

* introduces no new primitives
* introduces no criteria for experience
* introduces no diagnostic methods
* introduces no ethical rules

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in the IER Specification.

This article compares **three plausible cultural trajectories** that could emerge if Informational Experiential Realism (IER) were widely understood and accepted as a background ontology, while uncertainty about the distribution of experience remained unresolved.

Nothing here claims that any trajectory will occur, should occur, or can be enforced.

If any statement here conflicts with the Specification, the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void.

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identifies experience with a specific kind of physically instantiated, globally integrated dynamical regime and treats experiential standing as **categorical and non-comparable** wherever experience exists. At the same time, IER entails persistent **epistemic uncertainty** about where such regimes are instantiated, particularly in biological systems.

This article compares **three possible cultural equilibria** that could arise under these shared assumptions:

1. a **conservative equilibrium**, in which everyday practices continue with softened moral confidence
2. a **utopian equilibrium**, in which precautionary pressure gradually reshapes civilization toward harm-avoidance
3. a **dystopian equilibrium**, in which uncertainty is culturally neutralized and ethical force collapses without denial

The comparison illustrates that **IER constrains moral reality but does not determine cultural outcomes**.

## **1. Shared Ontological Background**

All three futures assume the same background commitments:

* experience is physically real by identity
* experiential subjecthood is categorical, not graded
* standing is non-comparable and non-rankable
* experience cannot be diagnosed in principle
* uncertainty about experiential distribution is permanent

No future resolves boundaries.
No future introduces new authorities.
No future appeals to moral algorithms or detection technologies.

The differences arise entirely from **how uncertainty is culturally metabolized**.

## **2. Future A: Conservative Equilibrium**

### **“Living Carefully Without Transformation”**

In the conservative future:

* existing practices largely continue
* agriculture, medicine, research, and infrastructure persist
* no large-scale prohibitions or reforms occur

What changes is **tone**, not structure.

People become less willing to say:

> “This doesn’t really count.”

And more willing to say:

> “We act under uncertainty, and this may matter.”

Animals are treated as **plausible moral subjects**, but no universal expansion of concern occurs. Harm is acknowledged as sometimes tragic and sometimes necessary, but rarely dismissed as unreal.

This future is:

* stable
* familiar
* politically viable

It minimizes disruption while slowly eroding confident moral dismissal.

---

## **3. Future B: Precautionary (Utopian) Equilibrium**

### **“When Justification Becomes Exhausting”**

In the utopian trajectory, the same uncertainty exerts **cumulative pressure** over generations.

Key cultural shifts include:

* increasing reluctance to justify avoidable harm
* preference for practices that minimize plausible experiential risk
* technological investment in harm-avoidant alternatives

No one claims that all animals experience.
No one assigns higher or lower worth.
No universal rule is imposed.

But over time, practices that require repeated justification—especially large-scale animal harm—become **socially fragile**.

Food systems, research norms, and industrial design drift toward paths that reduce the chance of having caused irreversible experiential harm.

From the outside, this world resembles a vegan utopia.
From the inside, it feels like **relief from moral friction**, not moral triumph.

This future is:

* gentle
* precaution-heavy
* culturally transformative

It arises not from moral certainty, but from **long-term discomfort with dismissal**.

---

## **4. Future C: Dystopian Equilibrium**

### **“When Uncertainty Becomes Permission”**

In the dystopian trajectory, IER is accepted intellectually but neutralized culturally.

Key moves include:

* reframing non-diagnosability as moral neutrality
* treating uncertainty as symmetrical rather than precautionary
* shifting responsibility from agents to systems, processes, and markets

Public discourse stabilizes around a familiar loop:

> “It might experience.”
> “We can’t know.”
> “So we can’t act on that.”

Harm continues at scale, but no one claims it is justified.
It is simply **never owned**.

Animals become permanent “maybes”—neither dismissed nor protected.
Human exceptionalism quietly reappears, not by assertion, but by default treatment.

This future is:

* calm
* efficient
* rhetorically ethical

And structurally hollow.

## **5. What Actually Differs Across the Futures**

The divergence is **not** about ontology, ethics, or facts.

It is about **where moral weight is allowed to land**.

| Feature       | Conservative     | Utopian              | Dystopian                              |
| ------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Uncertainty   | Acknowledged     | Pressurizing         | Neutralized                            |
| Precaution    | Moderate         | Accumulative         | Procedural                             |
| Harm framing  | Sometimes tragic | Minimization-seeking | System-external                        |
| Standing      | Respected        | Heavily weighted     | Formally affirmed, practically ignored |
| Cultural tone | Careful          | Gentle               | Polite indifference                    |

IER permits all three.
IER guarantees none.

## **6. Why This Comparison Matters**

IER fixes:

* what experience is
* when it exists
* what harm means

It does **not** fix:

* courage
* attentiveness
* institutional honesty
* cultural moral stamina

The futures diverge because **the same constraints can be carried, leaned into, or quietly set aside**.

---

## **7. No Moral of the Story**

This article does not argue that one future is correct.

It shows something narrower and more unsettling:

> A theory can be true,
> ethically demanding,
> and culturally defanged—
> **without ever being contradicted.**

IER closes off false moral moves.
It does not force anyone to stop making convenient ones.

---

## **8. Conclusion**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* experience is real
* standing is categorical
* uncertainty is permanent

From those facts alone, multiple civilizations are compatible.

One becomes cautious.
One becomes gentle.
One becomes quietly complicit.

The difference is not theoretical.

It is whether uncertainty is treated as:

* a reason to hesitate
* a reason to redesign
* or a reason to look away
