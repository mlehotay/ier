## **Cultural Equilibria Under Experiential Uncertainty**

## **Status and Authority**

**This document is NON-NORMATIVE and SPECULATIVE.**

It introduces no new ontological primitives, no criteria for experience, no diagnostic methods, and no ethical rules. It makes no prescriptions, recommendations, or forecasts.

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in the IER Specification and its canon-authoritative derivatives. If any statement here conflicts with the Specification, the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void.

This article examines **cultural and institutional stabilization**, not individual moral psychology, ethical reasoning, or political advocacy.

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identifies experience with a specific kind of physically instantiated, globally integrated dynamical regime and treats experiential standing as categorical and non-comparable wherever experience exists. At the same time, IER entails persistent epistemic uncertainty about where such regimes are instantiated, particularly in biological systems.

This article compares three plausible **cultural equilibria** that could arise if IER were widely accepted as background ontology while uncertainty about the distribution of experience remained unresolved: a conservative equilibrium, a precautionary equilibrium, and a dystopian equilibrium. The comparison illustrates that **IER constrains moral reality but does not determine cultural outcomes**. Divergence arises not from disagreement about truth, but from how moral weight is socially carried, redistributed, or quietly set aside.

## **1. Shared Ontological Background**

All three equilibria assume the same background commitments. Experience is physically real by identity. Experiential subjecthood is categorical rather than graded. Moral standing is non-comparable and non-rankable wherever experience exists. Experience cannot be diagnosed in principle, and uncertainty about its distribution is permanent.

No equilibrium resolves boundaries. No equilibrium introduces new authorities. None appeals to detection technologies, moral algorithms, or epistemic shortcuts.

The differences arise entirely from **how uncertainty is culturally metabolized**.

## **1.5 Sociological Framing: Why Shared Ontology Does Not Produce Shared Practice**

Sociology begins from a simple observation: shared beliefs do not reliably produce shared behavior.

Even when ontology and ethics are fixed, their practical consequences are filtered through institutions, professional norms, markets, coordination constraints, and inherited practices. Moral reality does not act directly on societies. It is mediated, buffered, distributed, and stabilized through social structure.

As a result, ethical pressure may be acknowledged without being owned. Moral weight may be redistributed without being denied. Responsibility may be softened without being rejected.

This article therefore does not ask how individuals reason under IER. It asks how cultures stabilize when morally significant uncertainty **cannot be resolved**.

## **2. Future A: Conservative Equilibrium**

### **Living Carefully Without Transformation**

In the conservative equilibrium, everyday practices largely continue. Agriculture, medicine, research, and infrastructure persist much as they are. No large-scale prohibitions or systemic redesigns occur.

What changes is tone rather than structure.

People become less willing to say that harm “doesn’t really count,” and more willing to say that they are acting under uncertainty and that this may matter. Animals are treated as plausible moral subjects, but no universal expansion of concern follows. Harm is acknowledged as sometimes tragic and sometimes necessary, but rarely dismissed as unreal.

Institutionally, this equilibrium stabilizes through continuity. Practices remain unchanged while their justification language becomes more cautious. Ethics review emphasizes care rather than outcome change. Legal categories of standing remain intact. Professional norms absorb uncertainty as a background condition of action rather than as a trigger for redesign.

This equilibrium is familiar, politically viable, and low-disruption. It allows societies to live carefully without transforming themselves, while slowly eroding confident moral dismissal.

## **3. Future B: Precautionary (Utopian) Equilibrium**

### **When Justification Becomes Exhausting**

In the precautionary equilibrium, the same uncertainty exerts cumulative pressure over time. No one claims certainty. No one assigns rankings. No universal rule is imposed. But repeated dismissal becomes uncomfortable.

From the inside, this does not feel like moral heroism or sacrifice. It feels like fatigue. The ongoing need to justify avoidable harm becomes socially and psychologically costly, and practices that require such justification begin to feel brittle.

Institutionally, change occurs through drift rather than decree. Market incentives favor harm-avoidant substitutes. Technological investment shifts toward designs that reduce irreversible exposure. Regulation follows cultural discomfort rather than leading it. Prestige accrues to practices that do not require repeated moral defense.

Over time, infrastructures encode reduced risk. Moral reasoning becomes less salient because fewer situations demand it. From the outside, this equilibrium resembles a utopia. From the inside, it feels like setting something down.

## **4. Future C: Dystopian Equilibrium**

### **When Uncertainty Becomes Permission**

In the dystopian equilibrium, IER is accepted intellectually but neutralized culturally. Non-diagnosability is reframed as moral neutrality. Uncertainty is treated as symmetrical rather than precautionary. Responsibility is shifted away from agents.

Public discourse stabilizes around a familiar pattern:

> “It might experience.”
> “We can’t know.”
> “So we can’t act on that.”

Harm continues at scale. No one claims it is justified. It is simply never owned.

Institutionally, responsibility is proceduralized. Decision-making is diffused across systems. Compliance replaces ownership. Abstraction replaces accountability. Moral weight is redistributed outward until no locus remains where it must be carried.

In this world, harm is no longer defended or denied. It is explained.
Nobody chose this.
It is simply how the system works.

This equilibrium is efficient, calm, and rhetorically ethical—and structurally hollow.

## **5. What Actually Differs Across the Equilibria**

The divergence among these futures is not about ontology, ethics, or facts. It concerns where moral weight is allowed to land.

In the conservative equilibrium, it lands lightly and locally. In the precautionary equilibrium, it accumulates and reshapes systems. In the dystopian equilibrium, it is displaced until it lands nowhere in particular.

IER permits all three. IER guarantees none.

---

## **6. Intergenerational Stabilization**

These equilibria persist because cultures reproduce practices rather than arguments. Children inherit routines, infrastructures, and defaults. Justifications thin over time even when behavior persists.

In the conservative equilibrium, moral caution becomes background etiquette. In the precautionary equilibrium, redesign replaces deliberation. In the dystopian equilibrium, abstraction becomes permanent and responsibility remains indefinitely displaced.

---

## **7. Why This Comparison Matters**

IER fixes what experience is, when it exists, and what counts as harm. It does not fix courage, attentiveness, institutional honesty, or cultural moral stamina.

The same constraints can be carried, leaned into, or quietly set aside.

---

## **8. No Moral of the Story**

This article does not argue that one equilibrium is correct.

It shows something narrower and more unsettling:

> A theory can be true,
> ethically demanding,
> and culturally defanged—
> without ever being contradicted.

IER closes off false moral moves. It does not force anyone to stop making convenient ones.

---

## **9. Conclusion**

Under Informational Experiential Realism, experience is real, standing is categorical, and uncertainty is permanent. From those facts alone, multiple civilizations are compatible.

One becomes cautious.
One becomes gentle.
One becomes quietly complicit.

The difference is not theoretical.
It is institutional, cultural, and cumulative.
