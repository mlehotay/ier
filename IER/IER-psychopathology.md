## 0. Status, Scope, and Canon Position

**Tier:** T2 — Elaboration and application
**Normativity:** Non-normative
**Authority:** Introduces **no new primitives, criteria, diagnostics, thresholds, or prescriptions**

This document presupposes the full Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identity claim and its account of:

* Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)
* intrinsic constraint
* admissible futures (choice spaces)
* bias formation
* inertia
* closure
* ownership and agency

**Purpose of this document**

> To explain familiar forms of psychopathology as **systematic distortions in how intrinsic constraint shapes, collapses, or preserves admissible futures within an intact Unified Experiential Field**, rather than as deficits, broken faculties, or failures of character.

This document does **not**:

* diagnose individuals
* define clinical categories
* prescribe interventions
* rank severity
* reify psychiatric taxonomies
* imply diminished subjecthood

All category names are used **descriptively**, not explanatorily.

## 1. Orientation: Why Psychopathology Needs a Structural Account

Psychopathology persistently resists explanation by:

* intelligence
* insight
* motivation
* effort
* belief revision
* self-knowledge

People often:

* understand their situation accurately,
* want to act differently,
* exert sustained effort,
* and remain unable to resolve the problem.

This creates pressure to invoke:

* broken control systems,
* defective cognition,
* motivational weakness,
* or hidden agents inside the mind.

Under Informational Experiential Realism, these moves are structurally unavailable.

IER identifies experience with the operation of a **single Unified Experiential Field** operating under **globally binding intrinsic constraint**. There are:

* no internal observers,
* no executive homunculi,
* no separate experiential subsystems,
* no stored scripts running independently of ownership.

Psychopathology must therefore be explained **within one intact experiential regime**, without fragmenting subjecthood or outsourcing agency.

## 2. The Baseline Resolution Geometry (Reference Case)

Before describing distortions, we establish a **reference structure**. This is not a norm, ideal, or standard of health — only the minimal geometry required for comparison.

### 2.1 Choice Space and Admissible Futures

At any moment, a UEF occupies a region of state space in which **multiple futures are physically admissible**.

These futures:

* are not imagined options,
* are not represented plans,
* are real continuations permitted by current constraints.

### 2.2 Bias Formation

Under intrinsic constraint:

* some futures become easier than others,
* gradients form that favor certain continuations,
* participation begins to align.

This is **bias**, not deliberation.

### 2.3 Collapse, Inertia, and Closure

When one future dominates:

* alternatives collapse,
* inertia sustains continuation cheaply,
* closure prevents immediate re-opening.

Settlement propagates globally.

### 2.4 Timing Alignment

Healthy resolution depends on **when** constraint acts:

* too early → integration fails
* too late → interference destabilizes settlement

Timing is structural, not cognitive.

## 3. One Map: The Resolution Pipeline

All phenomena discussed in this article involve distortions of **one pipeline**:

```
Admissible futures
→ bias formation
→ collapse
→ inertia
→ closure
```

Psychopathology arises when **one stage fails systematically** — not when experience, ownership, or subjecthood fails.

This single map explains:

* preserved insight with impaired action,
* symptom migration,
* partial relief without resolution,
* comorbidity without multiplying mechanisms.

## 4. Bias Failure: Dispersion of Constraint (ADHD)

### 4.1 Structural Description

In ADHD-like regimes:

* bias gradients are shallow,
* many futures remain simultaneously viable,
* no continuation gains enough dominance to collapse the space.

Intrinsic constraint is **diffuse** rather than absent.

### 4.2 Phenomenological Signature

This produces:

* difficulty initiating action,
* rapid switching between tasks,
* loss of traction rather than confusion,
* exhaustion without sustained progress.

The system is **over-open**, not disengaged.

### 4.3 Hyperfocus Reinterpreted

Hyperfocus occurs when:

* bias finally steepens,
* alternatives collapse abruptly,
* inertia takes over normally.

Hyperfocus is not excess control.
It is **finally having control at all**.

### 4.4 Structural Summary

> **ADHD reflects dispersion of intrinsic constraint that prevents stable bias formation, leaving the choice space persistently open.**

## 5. Closure Failure: Looping Constraint (OCD)

### 5.1 Structural Description

In OCD-like regimes:

* collapse occurs locally,
* but closure fails globally,
* the same future re-enters the admissible set.

Resolution does not hold.

### 5.2 Obsessions Reframed

Obsessions are not beliefs or representations.

They are:

> **Re-instantiated intrinsic constraint gradients that reopen the same region of the choice space after attempted settlement.**

Insight does not dissolve them because the failure is **downstream of belief**.

### 5.3 Compulsions Reframed

Compulsions are:

* local closure attempts,
* recruited to force settlement,
* unable to propagate globally.

They relieve briefly and then re-trigger the loop.

### 5.4 Structural Summary

> **OCD is looping resolution: intrinsic constraint repeatedly demands closure that never stabilizes.**

## 6. Premature Resolution: Constraint Discharge (Tourette’s)

### 6.1 Structural Description

In Tourette-like regimes:

* intrinsic constraint spikes locally,
* resolution occurs before bias integration,
* low-inertia motor paths discharge pressure immediately.

### 6.2 Urges and Relief

The characteristic urge reflects:

* accumulating intrinsic constraint,
* not belief or intention.

The tic:

* resolves that constraint cheaply,
* preserves the experiential regime,
* sacrifices contextual coherence.

### 6.3 Suppression and Rebound

Temporary suppression:

* reroutes constraint,
* increases internal load,
* leads to stronger eventual discharge.

This is constraint banking, not failure of will.

### 6.4 Structural Summary

> **Tourette’s preserves global coherence by shedding constraint prematurely through stereotyped discharge.**

## 7. Late Interference: Settlement Destabilization (Stuttering)

### 7.1 Structural Description

In stuttering-like regimes:

* inertia-dominated resolution has already begun,
* monitoring or corrective recruitment arrives too late,
* bias destabilizes mid-settlement.

### 7.2 Repetition and Blocking

The system oscillates:

* collapse begins,
* interference aborts it,
* restart occurs without reorganization.

This yields repetition, prolongation, or blockage.

### 7.3 Structural Summary

> **Stuttering is interference with the timing of settlement, not a failure of speech or planning.**

## 8. Global Distortions (Brief Extensions)

### 8.1 Panic

Panic reflects:

* global intrinsic constraint overload,
* collapse of nearly all futures,
* extreme narrowing toward escape or shutdown.

Resolution becomes catastrophic rather than selective.

### 8.2 Depression

Depression reflects:

* flattened future topology,
* weak bias gradients everywhere,
* effort without directional pull.

Futures exist but feel equally unreachable.

## 9. What Psychopathology Is *Not* Under IER

Under Informational Experiential Realism, psychopathology is **not**:

* loss of experience
* partial subjecthood
* epistemic unreliability
* moral weakness
* absence of ownership

Ownership persists because intrinsic constraint remains **internally borne**, even when agency is compromised.

> **A system can fully own its future while being unable to reliably collapse one.**

## 10. Ethical and Interpretive Consequences (Pointer Only)

From this structure it follows that:

* responsibility may attenuate without disappearing,
* harm may occur without distress,
* distress may occur without moral harm,
* accommodation concerns geometry, not indulgence.

No ethical prescriptions are offered here.
Normative authority remains fixed elsewhere in the corpus.

## 11. Summary: One Geometry, Many Distortions

Psychopathology does not require new entities, faculties, or subjects.

It reflects:

* where bias fails to form,
* where closure fails to hold,
* where resolution arrives too early,
* or where interference arrives too late.

All occur **within one Unified Experiential Field**, using the same machinery.

> **Psychopathology reflects systematic distortions in how intrinsic constraint shapes, collapses, or preserves admissible futures — not failures of will, belief, or intelligence.**
