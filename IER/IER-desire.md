# Desire as Bias Formation Over Admissible Futures

## 0. Status and Scope

This document is **Tier-2 (Elaboration and Application)** within the Informational Experiential Realism (IER) corpus.

It is **non-normative**. It introduces:

* no new ontological primitives
* no criterial or diagnostic claims
* no epistemic authority
* no ethical permissions or prescriptions

All binding commitments remain fixed **exclusively** in:

* `IER-specification.md`
* `IER-theory.md`
* `IER-dynamics.md`
* `IER-pipeline.md`
* `IER-ethics.md`

This article applies **only conditional on the existence of a Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.
If no UEF exists, nothing described here is experiential.

**Purpose of this document**

> To explain **desire** as a specific form of **bias formation** within the canonical resolution pipeline, without treating desire as a goal, value signal, selector, or agentive force.

## 1. Orientation: Why Desire Is Persistently Misread

Desire is almost always over-interpreted.

In everyday language, desire is treated as:

* motivation
* preference
* wanting
* value tracking
* evidence of what would be good
* a reason to act

In scientific and philosophical frameworks, desire is often recast as:

* reward anticipation
* dopaminergic signaling
* utility gradients
* deficit states
* goal representations

These framings differ in vocabulary, but they share a structural assumption:

> **Desire points toward something the system ought to realize.**

Under Informational Experiential Realism, that assumption fails.

IER does not permit internal goals, evaluators, selectors, or value-tracking mechanisms to function as primitives. Experience is identified with the operation of a physical system as a Unified Experiential Field, not with a decision-making apparatus layered on top of physical dynamics.

The task of this article is therefore **not** to deny that desire is real or powerful.
It is to explain **what desire must be**, given the identity claim IER already makes.

## 2. What Desire Is Not

Before introducing a structural account, several familiar interpretations must be explicitly excluded.

Under IER, desire is **not**:

* a belief about what would be good or correct
* a representation of a future state
* a signal indicating value or reward
* a command to act
* a deficit that demands satisfaction

Desire does **not**:

* create admissible futures
* select among alternatives
* collapse possibilities into actuality
* settle outcomes
* confer epistemic authority
* confer moral authority

Desire may *feel* like it does some of these things.
IER’s task is to explain why it feels that way **without endorsing the feeling as explanatory**.

## 3. The Canonical Resolution Pipeline

IER fixes a single, ordered structure for resolution within an intact experiential regime.
This structure is presupposed throughout the corpus and cannot be altered locally.

The canonical resolution pipeline is:

```
Admissible futures
→ bias formation
→ collapse
→ inertia
→ settlement
```

This sequence is:

* **necessary**
* **ordered**
* **globally presupposed**

No experiential phenomenon discussed in this article introduces a new stage, reorders these stages, or bypasses them.

All that follows concerns **how bias formation operates**, not how resolution occurs.

---

## 4. Desire as Bias Formation

The central claim of this article is simple and restrictive:

> **Desire is a form of bias formation over admissible futures.**

Bias formation is the stage at which admissible futures—already fixed by physical constraint—become **unevenly weighted** from within experience.

Desire operates **only** at this stage.

Structurally:

* Admissible futures exist **prior** to desire
* Desire alters their **relative salience and felt viability**
* Desire does not eliminate alternatives
* Desire does not force collapse

Desire is therefore **not upstream** of admissible futures and **not downstream** of collapse.
It does not create possibilities, and it does not realize them.

It reshapes the experiential geometry in which collapse will later occur.

## 5. Desire and History: Deformation, Not Sequencing

It is tempting to describe desire as “coming from the past” or as being “caused by history.”
IER requires a more careful formulation.

Sedimentation, hysteresis, and historical deformation do **not** constitute stages in the resolution pipeline. They instead **shape the topology of admissible futures themselves**.

Accordingly:

* History determines **which futures are admissible**
* Desire determines **how those futures are biased**

Desire reflects sedimented constraint geometry without replaying or representing the past.
It is a present-tense organization of bias over a future space already deformed by history.

This distinction preserves pipeline integrity while allowing desire to be historically conditioned.

## 6. Desire and Mood: Directional vs. Horizon Bias

Desire is frequently conflated with mood. Under IER, they are structurally distinct.

**Mood** is:

* long-horizon bias
* diffuse and global
* not directed toward specific closures

Mood alters how *far* futures feel, how costly traversal feels, and how viable continuation appears in general.

**Desire**, by contrast, is:

* directional bias
* selective salience toward particular futures
* often anchored to specific imagined or anticipated closures

Mood tilts the landscape.
Desire points along it.

Both operate within bias formation, but they shape experience differently and must not be collapsed into one another.

## 7. Why Desire Feels Urgent and Authoritative

Desire commonly feels:

* urgent
* clarifying
* solution-like
* self-justifying

This phenomenology is not accidental.

From within experience, a biased future often appears as:

> the locally lowest-conflict continuation under current constraint geometry.

That appearance produces a strong felt sense that *this* is what would resolve tension, restore coherence, or “make things right.”

IER insists on a crucial separation:

* **experiential urgency** does not imply
* **epistemic correctness** or **moral justification**

Desire explains why a future feels compelling.
It does not certify that the future is correct, safe, justified, or beneficial.

## 8. Desire Without Action or Collapse

Because desire does not perform collapse, it can exist **without action**.

A system may experience desire without:

* intention
* planning
* movement
* choice
* execution

Unfulfilled desire is therefore **not**:

* failed agency
* repression
* pathology
* intrinsic harm

This matters because many frameworks treat desire as incomplete unless acted upon.
IER rejects that assumption categorically.

Desire is a bias state, not a demand for realization.

## 9. Fixation, Narrowing, and Instability

Desire can destabilize experience without becoming pathological.

Common patterns include:

* fixation
* tunnel vision
* compulsive pull
* attentional narrowing

Structurally, these arise when:

* bias formation heavily over-weights a small subset of admissible futures
* alternative futures lose experiential salience
* collapse becomes brittle and fragile

Importantly, this narrowing does **not** itself constitute collapse.
It increases the *risk* of harmful or irreversible settlement, but it does not guarantee it.

IER therefore treats fixation as a **bias geometry problem**, not as a failure of will or rationality.

## 10. Desire and Pleasure

Desire is often mistaken for pleasure or treated as its inverse.

IER separates them cleanly:

* **Pleasure** is the experiential signature of **low-conflict intrinsic constraint**
* **Desire** is bias toward futures **anticipated** to yield such coherence

Because anticipation can be wrong, desire routinely mispredicts its own resolution.

This explains:

* disappointment
* post-satisfaction collapse
* the feeling that “this didn’t fix anything”

Desire is about **anticipated coherence**, not guaranteed relief.

---

## 11. Ethical Non-Implications

IER explicitly blocks several common inferences.

Desire does **not**:

* justify harm
* excuse coercion
* ground entitlement
* imply consent
* establish moral priority

Indeed, strong desire can **increase moral risk** by:

* narrowing attention to others’ constraint
* increasing collapse pressure
* encouraging irreversible settlement under biased conditions

These are ethical consequences of bias formation, not endorsements of desire itself.

No new ethical principles are introduced here.

---

## 12. Summary

Desire is not what experience wants.
It is not a goal, a value signal, or a command.

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

> **Desire is bias formation over admissible futures, experienced as directional pull toward anticipated coherence.**

It reshapes the future landscape without selecting outcomes.
It feels authoritative without being authoritative.
It can stabilize or destabilize without deciding anything.

Understanding desire this way preserves:

* the integrity of the resolution pipeline
* the non-agentive nature of bias
* the separation between experience and justification
