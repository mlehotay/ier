## **Sedimentation: Structural History Without Storage**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.x)**
*Explanatory Article — Non-Normative*

---

## **Status and Scope**

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no new ontological primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics**
* introduces **no epistemic access claims**
* introduces **no experiential identity claims**
* introduces **no ethical principles**

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md
IER-theory.md
IER-dynamics.md
IER-math.md
IER-canon.md
```

All informational language is used strictly as **descriptive shorthand** for
**physically instantiated state distinctions that modulate a system’s own future dynamics under constraint**, as defined in *IER-specification II.A*.

This document explains **how history can matter structurally** without introducing storage, representation, persistence of past entities, or memory.

---

## **0. Orientation: Why History Needs a Mechanism**

Across many domains, systems behave differently tomorrow because of what happened yesterday.

In most theoretical frameworks, this fact is explained by appealing—explicitly or implicitly—to **stored history**:

* retained traces
* internal records
* encoded representations
* latent contents awaiting retrieval

Under Informational Experiential Realism, these explanations are structurally unavailable.

IER identifies experience with the operation of a physical system under **globally binding intrinsic constraint**, not with the presence of internal archives. When an experiential regime ends, nothing experiential remains to be stored.

Yet history clearly matters.

This document introduces **sedimentation** as the mechanism by which history can persist **without the past persisting**.

> **Orientation signal:**
> *A system can be shaped by its past without containing it.*

---

## **1. The Storage Assumption (And Why It Fails)**

### **1.1 The Default Inference**

In everyday reasoning and much scientific theory, the following inference is taken for granted:

> If a system behaves differently later because of what happened earlier, then something from the earlier time must still exist inside the system.

This inference is rarely stated outright. It enters through familiar language:

* memory traces
* records
* engrams
* stored parameters
* internal models

The underlying assumption is simple: **influence requires persistence**.

---

### **1.2 Structural Unavailability Under IER**

Under IER, this inference fails.

There are:

* no stored experiential objects
* no latent experiential contents
* no retrieval-compatible ontology
* no internal archive of “what happened”

Experience exists only while a system operates as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**. When that regime ceases, nothing experiential remains that could be stored, retained, or accessed later.

If history is to matter under IER, it must do so **without persistence of past entities**.

---

## **2. Path Dependence as a Weak Descriptive Symptom**

### **2.1 Path Dependence Without Structure**

Many systems are described as **path-dependent**: their present behavior cannot be predicted from present conditions alone.

This description, by itself, is weak.

A system may be path-dependent while remaining:

* fully resettable
* perfectly reversible
* structurally unchanged by its history

Counters, registers, and reversible state machines can all be path-dependent in this thin sense while leaving no lasting mark.

---

### **2.2 Why Path Dependence Requires a Deeper Account**

Path dependence becomes structurally significant only when **history alters what remains possible**.

IER therefore treats path dependence not as an explanation, but as a **symptom** that demands a deeper account of how constraint itself can be reshaped.

That account begins with constraint mutability.

---

## **3. Constraint Is Historically Mutable**

### **3.1 Constraint Is Not Fixed Law**

Under IER, constraint is not a static overlay on otherwise free dynamics.

Constraint governs:

* which transitions are admissible
* which resolutions are available
* which futures are viable

Crucially, constraint is not immune to the effects of its own resolution.

Resolution is not neutral.
It can permanently alter the system’s future.

---

### **3.2 Closure Without Traces**

Irreversibility does not require remnants.

A pathway can close without leaving a mark.
A symmetry can break without preserving a record.
A possibility can disappear without being remembered.

What persists is simply this:

> **Certain alternatives are no longer available.**

That loss alone is sufficient to carry history forward.

---

## **4. Sedimentation (IER-Consistent Definition)**

We now introduce the central concept of this document.

> **Sedimentation** is the irreversible deformation of a system’s admissible futures caused by prior constraint resolution.

Sedimentation is:

* **structural**, not semantic
* **dynamical**, not symbolic
* **present-tense**, not archival
* **future-constraining**, not past-containing

Nothing is stored.
Nothing is retrieved.
No representation is formed.

History persists only as **altered possibility**.

---

### **4.1 What Sedimentation Is Not**

Sedimentation is not:

* memory
* storage
* encoding
* accumulation
* replay
* access to the past

It introduces **no informational objects of any kind**.

---

## **5. Formal Sketch: Sedimentation in Transition Structures**

### **5.1 Mutable Admissibility**

In the formal language of `IER-math.md`, a system’s evolution is governed by a set of **admissible transitions**.

Sedimentation occurs when:

* admissible transitions are **permanently removed**, or
* independence-preserving pathways are **irreversibly collapsed**, or
* resolution must occur **globally rather than locally**

The transition structure itself changes.

---

### **5.2 Traversal vs Topology Change**

Traversing a path once can alter the topology of the space.

After sedimentation:

* the same traversal may no longer be possible
* alternative routes may cease to exist
* resolution may require broader coordination

History is written into the **shape of admissibility**, not into stored states.

---

## **6. Sedimentation and Informational Slack**

### **6.1 Slack as History Dissipation**

Systems that retain **informational slack** can:

* buffer constraint
* localize resolution
* modularize effects
* reset subsystems

Such systems shed history.
Constraint does not stick.

---

### **6.2 Sedimentation as Slack Exhaustion**

Sedimentation occurs only when:

* constraint cannot be localized
* resolution cannot be deferred
* independence-preserving pathways are exhausted

Complexity alone does not guarantee sedimentation.
History appears only where slack runs out.

---

## **7. Sedimentation Without Experience**

### **7.1 Non-Experiential Systems**

Sedimentation occurs in:

* mechanical wear
* structural fatigue
* regulatory feedback systems
* adaptive but non-experiential control loops

No experience is implied.

---

### **7.2 Why Sedimentation ≠ Subjecthood**

Sedimentation does not require:

* intrinsic constraint
* ownership of resolution
* unified temporal continuity

Therefore:

> **Sedimentation does not entail experience.**

This blocks any inference from historical depth to consciousness.

---

## **8. Boundary Note: Sedimentation Inside a UEF**

When sedimentation occurs **within** a system that already sustains a Unified Experiential Field:

* constraint deformation is internally borne
* future narrowing is globally binding
* resolution cannot be externalized

This introduces:

* no epistemic authority
* no memory content
* no access to the past

It marks only a **structural prerequisite** for later discussion.

## **Intermission — Structural Fact**

> **The past does not persist as something present.
> It persists as what can no longer be otherwise.**
