# If You’re Not Sure It Can Feel, Be Careful

## The Rule (Up Front)

> **When you don’t know if something can feel pain, you should treat it gently.**

Not knowing is not permission.
It’s a warning.

## A Simple Story 📦

Imagine a closed box.

You don’t know what’s inside.

* It could be a toy.
* It could be nothing.
* Or it could be a small animal that’s too scared to make noise.

Someone says:

> “If it were alive, we’d hear something. Let’s shake it.”

A careful person says:

> **“If we’re not sure, we shouldn’t risk hurting whatever’s inside.”**

Most people already understand this.
We teach it to kids.

## What Feeling Pain Is Like (No Big Words)

Feeling pain doesn’t require:

* talking
* thinking hard
* understanding language

It just means:

> **There’s no way out of the problem, and everything hurts at once.**

Like when:

* a baby cries
* an animal panics
* you feel trapped and overwhelmed

That’s what “having feelings” means here.

## Why You Can’t Just Test for It 👀

You might think:

> “Can’t we just check?”

The problem is:

* pain doesn’t always show
* silence doesn’t mean safety
* not reacting doesn’t mean not suffering

Some people freeze.
Some animals hide pain.
Some things can’t signal at all.

So:

> **No reaction is not proof of no feeling.**

## Why This Changes What’s Allowed ⚠️

Here’s the important part.

If you’re gentle and nothing inside feels pain:

* nothing bad happens

If you’re careless and something inside *does* feel pain:

* real harm happens
* and you might never know

That’s why the safe rule exists.

## What This Means in Real Life

### Don’t Say:

* “It didn’t react, so it’s fine”
* “We’ll find out by trying”
* “No proof means no problem”

### Do Say:

* “We’re not sure, so let’s be careful”
* “We don’t need to test this”
* “Not everything needs to be pushed”

## The Shortest Version 🧸

> **If you don’t know whether something can feel pain, act like it might.**

Or even shorter:

> **When in doubt, don’t hurt.**
