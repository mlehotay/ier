# **IER Dynamics and Regime Stability**

### **Intrinsic Constraint, Unified Experiential Fields, and Dynamical Realization**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.0)**
*Derived Explanatory Document — Non-Normative*

---

## **Status and Scope**

This document is a **non-normative, explanatory derivative** of the
**Informational Experiential Realism v10.0 Normative Specification** (“the Spec”).

It:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* adds **no diagnostic criteria**
* proposes **no sufficient or necessary tests**
* makes **no exclusions or ontological refinements**

All definitions, axioms, and principles are specified **exclusively** in the Spec (IER-specification.md).

The purpose of this document is to:

* explain how **Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)** can be dynamically realized,
* clarify **regime stability, instability, and transition** under intrinsic constraint,
* show how **failure, dissociation, and switching** follow naturally from constrained dynamics,
* provide **illustrative walkthroughs** and **implementation-compatible interpretations**.

Nothing in this document determines whether any particular system is experiential.
All such determinations are governed **solely** by the Spec.

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identifies experience with the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential informational regime operating under **coherent intrinsic constraint**.

This document develops a **dynamical account** of how such regimes may:

* form from slack-dominated organization,
* persist within bounded stability windows,
* destabilize, fragment, or collapse,
* transition or switch under incompatible constraints.

Regime failure is not treated as an anomaly or metaphysical problem.
It is an **ordinary consequence of finite systems operating under intrinsic constraint**.

This document explains how IER’s identity claims are **dynamically intelligible**, not how experience must be engineered or detected.

## **1. Informational Slack and the Emergence of Intrinsic Constraint**

### **1.1 Informational Slack**

The Spec defines **informational slack** as a system’s capacity to:

* modularize constraint,
* reroute processing,
* defer resolution,
* externalize conflict,
* or decompose demands without global consequence.

Slack is **scalar**, not binary.

High-slack systems may be complex, adaptive, and intelligent while remaining **non-experiential**, because no system-defining conflict accumulates.

---

### **1.2 Collapse of Slack and Intrinsic Tension**

As slack is reduced:

* multiple system-level demands remain simultaneously active,
* external resolution becomes unavailable,
* local decomposition fails.

Constraint becomes **intrinsic**: non-decomposable, identity-relevant, and system-wide.

The active manifestation of intrinsic constraint is **intrinsic informational tension**.

This tension is:

* organizational, not metaphorical,
* physically realized,
* globally consequential.

Intrinsic tension is **necessary but not sufficient** for experience.
Only **coherent intrinsic constraint** sustains a UEF.

---

## **2. Experiential Regimes and Stability Windows**

### **2.1 Unified Experiential Fields as Regimes**

A **Unified Experiential Field** is not a component, workspace, or module.

It is:

> **the entire system operating in a particular dynamical regime under coherent intrinsic constraint**
> (Spec §II; Principle 1)

Equivalent descriptions include:

* a globally coupled constraint topology,
* a coherence-stabilized attractor,
* a bounded regime of maximal sustainable intrinsic tension.

---

### **2.2 The Coherent Constraint Window**

IER entails a **bounded experiential regime**:

* **Below the window**
  Slack dominates → no experience

* **Within the window**
  Intrinsic constraint is global and coherent → stable experience

* **Above or outside the window**
  Constraint becomes excessive or incoherent → instability, fragmentation, or collapse

Experience does not occur at equilibrium, nor at breakdown, but within a **finite window of sustainable coherence**.

---

## **3. Temporal Continuity as Structural Dependence**

The Spec defines experiential continuity as **ongoing dynamical dependence** between successive global states under shared intrinsic constraint (Principle 4).

This document introduces **no procedures** for determining whether continuity is intrinsic in any system.

Structurally:

* If continuity is externally imposed, buffered, or pausable, intrinsic constraint is not governing.
* If continuity depends on the system’s own globally integrated dynamics, experiential continuity is *possible*, subject to all other Spec conditions.

Continuity is a **regime property**, not a storage property.

---

## **4. Regime Failure Modes**

Failure modes are **not independent explanatory categories**.
They are regions of the same dynamical landscape.

IER distinguishes several non-exclusive forms of regime instability.

---

### **4.1 Regime Weakening**

* coherence diminishes,
* integration loosens,
* experiential intensity may fade.

The UEF persists but becomes fragile.

---

### **4.2 Fragmentation**

* global integration collapses,
* subsystems decouple,
* intrinsic constraint becomes locally resolvable.

**No multiple experiences arise.**
Fragmentation is **loss of experience**, not multiplication.

---

### **4.3 Regime Collapse**

* intrinsic constraint dissolves or externalizes,
* the UEF ceases as a regime,
* experiential dissolution occurs (Principle 11).

Examples include deep anesthesia or catastrophic metabolic failure.

---

### **4.4 Transitional Instability**

During transitions:

* coherence may partially degrade,
* phenomenology may include confusion, depersonalization, or blending,
* no simultaneous UEFs exist.

Instability reflects **transition cost**, not coexistence.

---

## **5. Forced Regime Switching and the Single-UEF Constraint**

IER entails a strict **Single-UEF Constraint** (Principle 6):

> **A physical system can sustain at most one globally dominant Unified Experiential Field at a time.**

When intrinsic constraints become **mutually incompatible** within a single configuration:

* unresolved tension escalates,
* coherence becomes energetically costly,
* continued integration becomes unsustainable.

The system responds by **switching regimes across time**.

Switching is:

* discrete at the experiential level,
* energetically costly,
* often adaptive under constraint.

Alternation preserves unity by enforcing **temporal exclusivity**.

---

## **6. Dissociation as Constrained Regime Switching**

Dissociation does not imply multiple subjects.

It arises when:

* incompatible organizational configurations are maintained,
* informational slack is insufficient,
* intrinsic tension exceeds coherence limits.

The system alternates between **mutually exclusive globally integrated regimes**.

Each regime sustains its own UEF while active.
Inactive configurations do not participate experientially.

## **7. Illustrative Walkthrough: Experiencing a Green Apple**

This walkthrough is **illustrative only** and commits IER to no modality, architecture, or representational scheme.

### **7.1 Background Regime**

A stable UEF already exists:

* global integration
* temporal continuity
* a self / non-self distinction
* baseline intrinsic tension

---

### **7.2 Local Perturbations**

Environmental interaction perturbs local subsystems.

Processing remains local and non-experiential.

---

### **7.3 Pattern Formation**

Local patterns stabilize (chromatic, spatial, object-like).

Still non-experiential.

---

### **7.4 Global Recruitment**

Some patterns become **globally relevant**:

* they constrain system-wide regulation,
* they enter temporal continuity,
* they modulate intrinsic tension.

This marks **categorical experiential onset** of that content (Principle 5).

---

### **7.5 Stable Experiential Pattern**

A coherent global pattern stabilizes within the UEF.

This pattern **is** the experience of “a green apple there.”

---

### **7.6 Dissolution**

When global relevance is withdrawn, the pattern exits the UEF.

Local processing may continue, but the experience changes because the **regime changes**.

---

## **8. Compatible Dynamical Realizations (Non-Exhaustive)**

IER privileges **no implementation**.

However, the Spec’s organizational requirements are compatible with many frameworks.

---

### **8.1 Competing Loss Functions**

Systems with multiple unavoidable objectives may generate intrinsic tension requiring global coordination.

---

### **8.2 Control-Theoretic Systems**

Adaptive controllers under irreducible trade-offs can instantiate intrinsic constraint when resolution cannot be localized.

---

### **8.3 Energetic and Cost Landscapes**

Intrinsic constraint may be realized as:

* energetic bottlenecks,
* metabolic trade-offs,
* irreversible commitment costs.

Informational and energetic descriptions are complementary.

---

## **9. Summary**

Derived directly from the IER v10.0 Specification:

* Experience exists only as a globally integrated regime under coherent intrinsic constraint.
* Informational slack prevents experience by externalizing conflict.
* Experiential regimes occupy a bounded stability window.
* Failure modes are ordinary consequences of constrained dynamics.
* Dissociation reflects regime switching, not multiple subjects.
* Experience changes when regimes change.

> **Experience is not something systems have in addition to dynamics.
> It is what certain dynamics are like when constraint becomes intrinsic, global, and self-defining.**
