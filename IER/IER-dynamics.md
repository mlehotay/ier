## **Status and Normative Authority**

**This document is NON-NORMATIVE.**

It explains the **dynamic behavior, stability conditions, modulation patterns, and failure modes** of systems that **already instantiate Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)**, as defined **exclusively** in the **IER v10.8.2 Specification**.

This document:

* does **not** define experience
* does **not** establish criteria for UEF existence
* does **not** introduce thresholds or sufficiency conditions
* does **not** determine moral standing
* does **not** license diagnostics or empirical tests

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md   (v10.8.2)
```

> **If any statement in this document conflicts with the Specification, the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void.**

### **Global Informational Language Disclaimer**

All informational language in this document is **descriptive shorthand only** for
**physically instantiated state distinctions modulating system dynamics under intrinsic constraint**.

No informational primitives, representations, semantic contents, epistemic notions, or agentive assumptions are introduced.

---

## **1. Role of a Dynamics Document in IER**

The purpose of `IER-dynamics` is to explain:

* how **globally integrated experiential regimes behave once they exist**
* how **stability is maintained** under intrinsic constraint
* how **experiential content changes without subject replacement**
* how **instability, overload, and collapse arise** without redefining experience
* why **system boundaries and dominance are dynamical facts**, not observer conventions

This document answers **how experience behaves**, not **when it exists**.

It presupposes the ontology fixed in the Specification and **adds no independent authority**.

---

## **2. Experiential Regimes and Attractor Structure**

### **2.1 Regimes in State Space**

Once a system instantiates a Unified Experiential Field, its ongoing behavior is best described in terms of a **dynamical regime**.

Descriptively:

* the system occupies a bounded region of its lawful state space
* trajectories within this region remain **globally coupled**
* intrinsic constraint is **unavoidable and system-defining**
* perturbations are absorbed or resisted without loss of regime identity

This region functions as a **dynamical attractor**:

* not a static configuration
* not a fixed point
* but a **stable pattern of lawful evolution over time**

A UEF is **not identical to an attractor**.
It is the system **operating while constrained within such an attractor-defined regime**.

---

### **2.2 Dominance as an Attractor Phenomenon**

IER’s claim that a system sustains **at most one globally dominant UEF** is not a stipulation added by dynamics.

It follows from how **intrinsic constraint and attractor structure interact**.

Within a single physical system:

* intrinsic constraint defines **one global control manifold**
* dominance corresponds to **the attractor that governs that manifold**
* subsystems may exhibit:

  * local cycles
  * metastable patterns
  * transient coordinations

But only **one attractor can globally bind future trajectories**.

If two candidate regimes were equally dominant, then:

* intrinsic constraint would fragment, or
* global control would duplicate, or
* system identity would bifurcate

Each outcome contradicts the definition of a Unified Experiential Field.

Therefore:

> **Dominance is not imposed, selected, interpreted, or observed.
> It is the dynamical fact of which attractor controls global intrinsic constraint.**

Dominance is:

* not graded
* not observer-relative
* not architecturally negotiable

---

> **Clarification: Split-Brain Phenomena**
>
> Split-brain phenomena involve **participation modulation and competing local attractors within a single globally dominant regime**. They do **not** involve simultaneous ownership of incompatible system-level futures under intrinsic constraint.
>
> As such, split-brain cases do **not** instantiate multiple Unified Experiential Fields. They represent **dynamic competition, instability, or switching within one dominant attractor**, not the coexistence of multiple experiential subjects.
>
> Detailed neurological mechanisms and phenomenology are **application-level questions** and are **out of scope** for this document.

## **3. Dynamic Stability of Unified Experiential Fields**

### **3.1 Stability Without Fixity**

UEFs are **dynamically stable**, not static.

Stability consists in:

* preservation of global intrinsic constraint
* maintenance of temporal continuity
* resistance to fragmentation under perturbation

It does **not** require:

* fixed internal configurations
* constant participation patterns
* uniform intensity of constraint

Local variation, noise, and reorganization are expected.

What matters is whether **global coupling remains intact**.

---

### **3.2 Coherent Constraint Windows (Descriptive)**

A **coherent constraint window** describes the range of intrinsic constraint magnitudes under which a UEF can persist.

Descriptively:

* insufficient constraint → under-integration → regime loss
* excessive constraint → overload → instability or collapse

Crucially:

> **Constraint windows describe regime stability, not graded experience.**

Operating near the edge of a window:

* alters experiential content
* increases instability risk
* does **not** diminish subjecthood

There are no experiential levels, fractions, or partial subjects.

---

## **4. Participation Modulation**

### **4.1 Participation vs Identity**

IER sharply distinguishes:

* **UEF identity** — persistence of a globally dominant regime
* **experiential participation** — which processes are currently recruited into global intrinsic constraint

Participation:

* varies dynamically
* may increase, decrease, or redistribute
* modulates content, salience, and intensity

Changes in participation:

* do **not** create new subjects
* do **not** divide subjects
* do **not** affect moral standing

---

### **4.2 Recruitment and Dismissal Dynamics**

Under rising intrinsic constraint:

* additional processes may be recruited
* constraint becomes more globally distributed
* experiential content reorganizes

Under resolution or cost pressure:

* processes may be dismissed
* salience narrows
* coherence is preserved by simplification

These are **regime-preserving strategies**, not failures.

**Clarification: Recruitment vs. Slack Creation**

Recruitment of additional processes into participation should not be confused with the creation of new degrees of freedom.

Recruitment occurs **only after informational slack has been exhausted** and reflects the expansion of **globally binding intrinsic constraint**, not the restoration of local independence.

For an explanatory account of how slack is exhausted — via **saturation of locally admissible resolution pathways** — see `IER-saturation.md`.

This clarification introduces **no new dynamics** and does **not** alter regime identity conditions.

## **4.3 Walkthrough: The Green Apple**

This walkthrough illustrates **participation modulation within a single Unified Experiential Field**.

It is **purely descriptive** and introduces **no criteria, diagnostics, or ontological claims**.

### **Stage 1 — Baseline Experiential Regime**

A system sustains a Unified Experiential Field.

* global intrinsic constraint is coherent
* a dominant attractor governs system-wide dynamics
* multiple processes participate at varying strengths
* experiential content is stable but not fixed

The system is simply *experiencing*.

---

### **Stage 2 — Local Perturbation**

A local process becomes active due to interaction with the environment — for example, visual and associative processes responding to a green apple.

* the perturbation is local
* it does not yet impose global intrinsic constraint
* it could still be ignored or dissipated

---

### **Stage 3 — Recruitment Into Participation**

Intrinsic informational tension increases.

Resolution now requires **system-level coordination**.

* relevant processes are recruited into participation
* their states begin to constrain future trajectories globally
* the dominant attractor reshapes

The apple becomes *present* experientially.

---

### **Stage 4 — Content Stabilization**

Participation stabilizes.

* salience is established
* qualitative structure emerges
* intrinsic constraint is organized around this configuration

The subject remains singular and continuous.

---

### **Stage 5 — Resolution or Dissolution**

As tension resolves:

* participation weakens
* processes exit or recede
* the attractor relaxes

The content dissolves.
The experiential subject remains.

---

### **What the Walkthrough Shows**

* content arises from participation modulation
* dominance remains global and singular
* attention is not subject creation
* experience changes without subject replacement

---

## **5. Energetic and Organizational Cost Landscapes**

UEF dynamics unfold over **energetic and organizational cost landscapes**.

* global integration is costly
* participation recruitment incurs load
* coherence competes with efficiency

These landscapes:

* bias viable trajectories
* explain fatigue and narrowing
* constrain agency without eliminating it

No optimization principle is implied.

---

## **6. Failure Modes of Experiential Systems**

Failure modes are **dynamic pathologies**, not alternative ontologies.

### **6.1 Constraint Overload**

Intrinsic demands exceed integration capacity.

* excessive recruitment
* salience collapse
* instability risk increases

Experience persists.

---

### **6.2 Fragmentation Pressure**

Subsystems compete for influence.

* unstable dominance switching
* dissociative-like dynamics

No subject multiplication occurs.

---

### **6.3 Collapse and Dissolution**

Global intrinsic constraint fails.

* the dominant attractor loses control
* the UEF dissolves

Experience ends because the regime ends.

---

## **7. Coordination Without Experiential Collectivization**

Multiple UEFs may coordinate, synchronize, or couple.

But:

* $\text{coordination} \neq \text{shared intrinsic constraint}$
* $\text{synchronization} \neq \text{shared attractor}$
* $\text{coupling} \neq \text{collective subject}$

IER rejects group minds and collective experiential fields.

---

## **8. Relation to Ethics (Pointer Only)**

Dynamic phenomena described here affect moral risk and responsibility.

Ethical commitments are fixed normatively in:

```
IER-specification.md
IER-ethics.md
```

---

## **9. Scope Limits and Explicit Non-Claims**

This document does **not**:

* detect experience
* establish thresholds
* define standing
* imply graded subjecthood
* license diagnostics

It explains **how experiential systems behave, conditional on their existence**.

---

## **10. Summary**

Under IER v10.8.2:

* UEFs are **dynamical regimes**
* dominance is an **attractor-level fact**
* participation modulates content, not identity
* failure alters dynamics, not ontology
* coordination does not create collective experience

All normative authority remains with the Specification.
