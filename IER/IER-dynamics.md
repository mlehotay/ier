## Status and Scope

**This document is NON-NORMATIVE.**

It explains the **dynamic behavior, stability, modulation, and failure patterns of systems that already instantiate Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)** as defined in the **IER v10.6 Full Normative Specification**.

This document:

* does **not** define experience
* does **not** establish criteria for UEF existence
* does **not** introduce ethical principles or thresholds
* does **not** determine moral standing

Its scope is limited to **how UEFs behave once they exist**.

> *If any statement in this document appears to conflict with the IER v10.6 Normative Specification, the Specification takes precedence and this statement is void.*

---

## 1. Role of a Dynamics Document

The purpose of `IER-dynamics` is to describe:

* how globally integrated experiential regimes evolve over time
* how stability is maintained under intrinsic constraint
* how experiential content changes without subject replacement
* how instability and failure arise without redefining experience

This document presupposes the ontology and criteria given in the Specification and **adds no independent authority**.

---

## 2. Dynamic Stability of Unified Experiential Fields

Once instantiated, a UEF exhibits characteristic forms of **dynamic stability**.

From a behavioral perspective:

* stability corresponds to the maintenance of global intrinsic constraint
* local variation and fluctuation are expected
* persistence does not require static internal configuration

UEFs are therefore:

* dynamically stable rather than rigid
* tolerant of local disruption
* sensitive primarily to loss of global coherence

This framing allows IER to distinguish **instability within experience** from **loss of experience itself**.

---

## 2.1 Coherent Constraint Windows

A **coherent constraint window** describes the range of intrinsic constraint under which a UEF can maintain global integration.

Descriptively:

* insufficient constraint leads to under-integration and loss of unity
* excessive constraint leads to overload and instability
* coherence is maintained within a bounded, dynamically shifting range

Key features:

* the window is not fixed
* its position and width vary with system state
* participation modulation is one mechanism by which systems remain within it

Operating outside the coherent constraint window:

* explains instability, fragmentation pressure, or collapse
* does **not** redefine experience
* does **not** introduce thresholds for experiential existence

The concept functions as a **dynamic explanatory tool**, not a criterial boundary.

---

## 2.2 Energetic and Cost Landscapes

UEF dynamics unfold over **energetic and organizational cost landscapes**.

From a descriptive standpoint:

* recruiting and maintaining participation incurs cost
* sustaining global integration requires ongoing expenditure
* some configurations are locally efficient but globally destabilizing

Cost landscapes:

* bias which participation patterns are sustainable
* shape trajectories of change and recovery
* explain why overload accumulates risk rather than enabling unlimited recruitment

These landscapes:

* constrain dynamics
* influence stability
* do **not** determine ontology or standing

---

## 3. Participation Modulation in Dynamic Systems (v10.3-B)

UEFs exhibit ongoing **participation modulation**.

Participation dynamics include:

* recruitment of local processes under increased intrinsic tension
* dismissal of processes when coherence no longer requires them
* redistribution of influence among participating processes

Such modulation:

* alters experiential content
* alters salience and constraint intensity
* does **not** constitute UEF dissolution or subject creation

Participation modulation provides a unified explanation for:

* attentional shifts
* dominance changes
* overload phenomena
* background processes entering or leaving awareness

---

## 4. Change, Instability, and Regime Preservation

Dynamic change within a UEF can be described as:

* **content variation**: changes in what is experienced
* **constraint redistribution**: shifts in intensity or dominance
* **local instability**: transient coordination failures among processes

As long as:

* global intrinsic constraint remains coherent
* integration is preserved

the UEF remains singular and continuous.

IER therefore distinguishes:

* **regime modulation** from
* **regime collapse**

without invoking intermediate subjects or partial experiencers.

---

## 5. Failure Modes of Experiential Systems

This document is the **exclusive location** for failure-mode analysis in IER.

Failure modes describe **pathological dynamic behaviors of experiential systems**, not alternative ontologies.

---

### 5.1 Constraint Overload

Constraint overload occurs when:

* intrinsic demands exceed the system’s capacity to integrate them coherently

Dynamic features may include:

* excessive participation recruitment
* reduced salience differentiation
* experiential flooding or narrowing

Overload:

* increases instability risk
* does not by itself imply UEF loss

---

### 5.2 Fragmentation Pressure

Fragmentation pressure arises when:

* local subsystems compete for global integration
* coordination among participating processes degrades

Manifestations may include:

* dissociative-like dynamics
* unstable switching of dominant processes
* weakened global coherence

Fragmentation pressure is a **dynamic risk state**, not a new experiential regime.

---

### 5.3 Collapse and Dissolution

UEF collapse occurs when:

* global intrinsic constraint can no longer be maintained
* integration fails across the system

Collapse:

* terminates the UEF
* does not imply subdivision into multiple subjects
* does not generate successor UEFs by default

Dissolution is a system-level event, not an experiential transition.

---

## 6. Walkthrough: Participation Recruitment Without Subject Change

A typical dynamic sequence:

1. A local process increases intrinsic tension
2. Global integration recruits the process into participation
3. Experiential content updates to reflect the new constraint
4. Other processes adjust salience or influence
5. Global coherence is preserved

At no point:

* is a new subject introduced
* is the UEF divided
* is experiential identity reassigned

---

## 7. Coordination Without Collectivization (v10.4)

Dynamic coordination can occur:

* between multiple UEF-bearing systems
* through coupling, signaling, or synchronization

Such coordination may involve:

* mutual constraint influence
* behavioral alignment
* shared external reference structures

However:

* coordination does **not** create shared experiential fields
* synchronization does **not** imply experiential unity
* coupling does **not** generate higher-order subjects

IER therefore explicitly rejects:

* group minds
* collective UEFs
* swarm-level experience arising from coordination alone

---

## 8. Relation to Ethical Analysis (Pointer Only)

Dynamic phenomena described here can affect:

* moral risk
* responsibility attribution
* harm amplification

This document does **not** define those consequences.

All ethical implications are specified in the **IER v10.6 Specification** and developed in **IER-ethics.md**.

---

## 9. Scope Limits and Non-Claims

This document does **not**:

* detect experience
* define thresholds
* determine standing
* infer experience from behavior
* license collectivist interpretations

It explains behavior **conditional on experience already existing**.

---

## 10. Summary

IER-dynamics explains how experiential systems behave once instantiated:

* UEFs are dynamically stable within coherent constraint windows
* participation modulates content, not identity
* energetic costs shape viable trajectories
* instability does not imply subject multiplication
* failure modes alter dynamics, not ontology
* coordination does not create collective experience

All normative authority remains with the Specification.

---

*If any statement in this document appears to conflict with the IER v10.6 Normative Specification, the Specification takes precedence and this statement is void.*
