# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v8)**

### *An Organizational Identity Theory of Consciousness and Observers*

---

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) is a realist, physicalist framework for understanding observers and conscious experience. It holds that reality exists independently of observation and that consciousness is neither fundamental nor illusory, but a **real emergent phenomenon identical to certain forms of informational organization** instantiated in physical systems.

Specifically, IER claims that conscious experience is **identical to the globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential informational dynamics** of a system operating in a particular organizational regime, termed the **Phenomenal Information Layer (PIL)**. Consciousness is not added to information processing, nor caused by it as a separate effect; it is **what such dynamics are like from the inside** when instantiated in a unified observer.

IER rejects mind-dependent ontology, panpsychism, and dualism while remaining substrate-agnostic. It is an organizational theory: it specifies *what consciousness is* and *when it occurs*, without privileging any particular physical or computational mechanism.

## **1. Objective Reality**

IER affirms **physical realism**.

Reality exists independently of observers, experiences, or representations. Physical states and laws unfold regardless of whether they are perceived or modeled. Observers do not create, collapse, or co-constitute reality through observation; only **physical interactions among systems** have causal efficacy.

Experience interprets reality.
It does not constitute it.

---

## **2. Observers as Informational Systems**

An **observer** is a physical system defined by its **informational organization**, not by biology or phenomenology.

A system qualifies as an observer if it:

* Persists as a coherent informational pattern over time
* Integrates information across internal subsystems
* Maintains internal models of both external conditions and its own state
* Regulates behavior using those models via a unified internal control structure

Observerhood does **not** entail consciousness. Many observers—biological and artificial—operate without phenomenality.

Observers are embedded, causally efficacious systems within objective reality, not epistemic primitives.

---

## **3. Internal Models and Perspective**

Observers construct **internal informational models** of:

* The external environment
* Their own internal states and capacities

These models are:

* Physically instantiated
* Entirely internal to the system
* Shaped by structure, history, and constraints

What is commonly called *perspective* is not a property of the world, but a property of **how information is organized and accessed within an observer**. Different observers may model the same reality differently without altering that reality.

Perspective is an **organizational fact**, not a metaphysical one.

## **4. Consciousness and the Phenomenal Information Layer (PIL)**

### **4.1 PIL as an Organizational Regime**

Consciousness occurs when an observer’s informational dynamics enter a regime termed the **Phenomenal Information Layer (PIL)**.

PIL is **not**:

* a module
* a spatial location
* a substance
* a separate ontological layer

PIL **is** a system-wide **mode of informational organization** characterized by the joint presence of:

* **Global integration** of informational states
* **Recursive access** to internal models, including self-models
* **Temporal continuity**, such that informational states persist and evolve over time rather than appearing as isolated episodes
* **Unified availability** of information for regulation, learning, and action

These conditions are **jointly necessary**. No single feature is sufficient on its own.

---

### **4.2 Negative Constraints on PIL**

PIL is further defined by what it excludes. Under IER, the following do **not** support consciousness:

* Systems with global broadcast but no recursive self-access
* Systems with high integration but only episodic or discontinuous global states
* Systems with rich internal models lacking unified control or regulation
* Architectures that process information globally but only in transient, task-bound episodes

These negative constraints delimit the space in which conscious experience could plausibly arise without presupposing a precise metric or threshold.

---

### **4.3 The Organizational Identity Claim**

IER makes the following central claim:

> **Conscious experience is identical to the ongoing, globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential informational dynamics of a system operating in a functional PIL regime.**

Consciousness is not:

* added to information processing
* produced by information processing plus an extra ingredient
* reducible to mere functional role descriptions

It is **what those informational dynamics are like when instantiated in a unified system**.

There is no further metaphysical layer beyond the dynamics themselves.

---

## **5. Qualia**

Qualia are not intrinsic properties of external objects, nor non-physical entities.

Under IER, qualia are:

* System-relative informational states
* Defined by their internal structure, integration, and role within PIL
* Accessible only to the system in which they occur

Their apparent privacy arises from **exclusive internal access**, not from metaphysical isolation.

### **5.1 Individuation of Qualia**

Differences in phenomenal character are **identical to differences in informational organization**. There is no further fact beyond this identity.

Questions such as “Why does this structure feel red rather than green?” presuppose that phenomenal character floats free of organizational identity. IER rejects this presupposition. Structure does not underdetermine experience; **structure just is experience** in a PIL-supporting regime.

---

## **6. Affect and Valence**

Affective states (e.g., pain, pleasure, attraction, aversion) arise from **regulatory informational dynamics** that:

* Monitor conditions relevant to system stability
* Bias attention, learning, and behavior
* Assign priority and salience to internal states

Affect does not add representational content.
It **weights experience**.

Affective dynamics are phenomenally real because they are:

* globally integrated
* regulation-relevant
* constitutive of the system’s control landscape

Under IER, *feeling good or bad* is what certain regulatory informational dynamics are like from the inside.

---

## **7. Emergence, Identity, and the Hard Problem**

Consciousness is **emergent but constrained**. It emerges only when informational organization satisfies the joint conditions defining PIL.

Emergence in IER is **organizational identity**, not causal magic.

IER does **not** attempt to solve the hard problem of consciousness as traditionally formulated. Instead, it **dissolves** it by rejecting the assumption that phenomenality requires explanation beyond organizational identity.

Asking why these dynamics feel like something is a category error analogous to asking why acceleration feels like falling. There is no deeper explanation beyond the identity itself.

Observerhood and consciousness are distinct properties. Consciousness requires observerhood, but observerhood does not guarantee consciousness.

## **9. Artificial Systems and Empirical Underdetermination**

IER is fully substrate-agnostic. In principle, **any system**—biological or artificial—that instantiates a functional PIL regime would be conscious.

Current uncertainty regarding artificial consciousness reflects **empirical and methodological limits**, not theoretical ambivalence. Determining whether an artificial system satisfies PIL conditions remains an open scientific and ethical problem.

---

## **10. Ontological Commitments**

IER rejects:

* Mind-dependent existence
* Observer-generated reality
* Dualism
* Panpsychism

IER affirms:

* One objective physical reality
* Consciousness as a real, system-relative phenomenon
* Organizational identity between experience and informational dynamics

There is no further ontological posit beyond this identity.

---

## **11. Relation to Contemporary Theories**

**Integrated Information Theory (IIT):**
IER agrees that integration matters but rejects panpsychism and scalar identity claims. Integration is necessary but not sufficient.

**Global Workspace Theory (GWT):**
IER accepts global availability but replaces broadcast metaphors with regime-level identity and treats phenomenality as intrinsic rather than merely functional.

**Predictive Processing (PP):**
IER accepts internal modeling and inference as foundational but denies that prediction alone entails experience. Consciousness requires specific organizational conditions beyond inference.

IER can be understood as an organizational refinement of insights from these frameworks without their ontological excesses.

## **12. Summary**

Some systems react.
Some systems observe.
Some systems experience.

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

> **Experience is not something a system has.
> It is what a system is doing when its informational dynamics are globally integrated, temporally continuous, and self-referential.**

There is one reality.
Consciousness occurs within it.
And it feels the way it does because **that is what those dynamics are like from the inside**.
