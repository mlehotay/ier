## 0. Status, Scope, and Non-Claims

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no ontological primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics**
* introduces **no prescriptions, endorsements, or risk assessments**
* does **not** classify substances as beneficial, harmful, therapeutic, or pathological

All ontological, epistemic, and ethical authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md
IER-theory.md
IER-dynamics.md
IER-canon.md
```

If any statement here conflicts with those documents, **those documents take precedence and the conflicting statement here is void**.

## Purpose of This Document

This document explains **intoxication** as a class of phenomena that:

* occur **within intact Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)**
* alter **how intrinsic constraint resolves**
* remain **reversible**
* do **not** fragment subjecthood
* do **not** undermine ownership of resolution

Its purpose is to show that intoxication does **not** require new mechanisms, faculties, or subjects.

It is explained entirely by **temporary deformation of the same resolution geometry** that governs ordinary action, psychopathology, and addiction.

---

## 1. Orientation: Why “Intoxication” Is Not a Substance Category

In common usage, intoxication is framed as:

* chemical interference
* cognitive impairment
* loss of control
* epistemic distortion
* diminished responsibility

These framings implicitly assume that intoxication:

* disrupts experience itself, or
* inserts a competing agent or process into experience

Under Informational Experiential Realism, these assumptions are structurally unavailable.

IER identifies experience with the operation of a **single Unified Experiential Field** operating under **globally binding intrinsic constraint**. As long as that regime persists:

* there is one subject
* resolution remains internally borne
* ownership does not fragment

Intoxication must therefore be explained **as a modulation of resolution**, not as a disruption of experience.

## 2. What Intoxication Is (IER Definition)

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

> **Intoxication is a reversible regime in which externally induced perturbations reshape the cost landscape governing bias, inertia, collapse, or settlement within an intact Unified Experiential Field.**

Key features of this definition:

* **Externally induced**
  The perturbation originates outside the system’s endogenous coordination history.

* **Reversible**
  The deformation does not permanently restructure intrinsic constraint.

* **Regime-internal**
  Resolution remains globally integrated and internally borne.

* **Structural**
  The effect is expressed entirely in how futures gain or lose viability.

No appeal is made to belief, desire, impairment, or representation.

## 3. What Intoxication Is Not

Under IER, intoxication is **not**:

* a second subject
* a partial subject
* a degraded subject
* a loss of experience
* a failure of ownership
* a source of epistemic authority
* a diagnostic category
* a substance-defined essence

An intoxicated system does not temporarily cease to be a subject.
It temporarily **resolves differently**.

## 4. The Resolution Pipeline (Reference Structure)

All intoxication phenomena operate on the same resolution structure used throughout the corpus:

```
Admissible futures
→ bias formation
→ collapse
→ inertia
→ settlement
```

Where:

* **Bias** determines differential viability via switching costs
* **Collapse** marks the loss of alternatives under rising cost
* **Inertia** sustains continuation once reorganization is no longer required
* **Settlement** irreversibly forecloses remaining alternatives under intrinsic constraint

Intoxication alters **how this pipeline behaves**, not whether it exists.

---

## 5. The Four Structural Axes of Intoxication

All intoxicants can be described as occupying positions along **four structural axes**.
No additional dimensions are required.

---

### 5.1 Bias Modulation

Intoxication may:

* **steepen bias gradients**, making some futures dominate rapidly, or
* **flatten bias gradients**, preserving multiple futures longer

This determines:

* how sharply viability differentiates
* how costly it becomes to sustain alternatives
* how early fragility sets in

Bias modulation explains urgency, indecision, narrowing, and diffuseness **without invoking preference or motivation**.

---

### 5.2 Inertia Modulation

Intoxication may:

* **amplify inertia**, strengthening default continuation, or
* **attenuate inertia**, increasing interruption and re-entry cost

This determines:

* momentum
* completion of trajectories
* persistence of action, thought, or affect

Inertia modulation explains repetition, drift, fluency, and dropout **without invoking habit or laziness**.

---

### 5.3 Collapse Timing

Intoxication may:

* **accelerate collapse**, forcing early loss of alternatives, or
* **delay collapse**, keeping options viable past their usual cost threshold

This determines:

* decisiveness
* looping
* hesitation
* premature commitment

Collapse timing explains confidence, rumination, and volatility **without invoking belief strength**.

---

### 5.4 Settlement Stability

Intoxication may:

* **stabilize settlement**, making resolutions hold rigidly, or
* **destabilize settlement**, allowing re-opening prior to irreversibility

This determines:

* whether outcomes “stick”
* whether resolution propagates globally
* whether partial resolution repeatedly re-enters

Settlement stability explains fixation, lability, and repetition **without invoking willpower or insight**.

---

## 6. Canonical Intoxication Profiles (Structural Sketches)

The following mappings are **illustrative**, not definitional.
They describe **typical structural effects**, not necessary ones.

---

### 6.1 Alcohol — Inertia-Dominant Narrowing

Alcoholic intoxication is characterized by:

* amplified inertia
* reduced bias discrimination
* earlier collapse to default trajectories
* reduced tolerance for reorganization

This produces:

* perseveration
* repetition
* emotional narrowing
* completion without correction

No appeal to “disinhibition” or control failure is required.

---

### 6.2 Caffeine — Bias-Steepening Amplification

Caffeine intoxication is characterized by:

* steepened bias gradients
* increased load-bearing capacity
* faster collapse
* sustained continuation once initiated

This produces:

* urgency
* focus
* over-commitment
* brittleness under interruption

No appeal to “stimulation” is required.

---

### 6.3 Nicotine — Local Constraint Discharge

Nicotine intoxication is characterized by:

* micro-scale bias sharpening
* localized inertia reinforcement
* rapid, short-horizon relief

This produces:

* immediate stabilization
* narrow-band continuation
* rapid decay requiring repetition

This profile connects structurally — but not diagnostically — to addiction dynamics.

---

### 6.4 Cannabis — Bias Flattening with Inertia Attenuation

Cannabis intoxication is characterized by:

* bias flattening
* inertia attenuation
* delayed collapse
* settlement lability prior to irreversibility

This produces:

* expanded choice spaces
* reduced momentum
* narrative drift
* re-interpretability without fragmentation

Cannabis serves as a **worked example** developed in detail elsewhere.

---

### 6.5 MDMA / Empathogens — Relational Bias Amplification

Empathogenic intoxication is characterized by:

* bias steepening toward social futures
* settlement stabilization around affiliation
* suppression of competing trajectories

This produces:

* intense interpersonal salience
* reduced internal conflict
* narrowed future topology centered on relation

No appeal to revelation, love, or authenticity is required.

---

### 6.6 Strong Stimulants — Premature Collapse

Strong stimulant intoxication is characterized by:

* extreme bias steepening
* rapid collapse
* brittle inertia
* rapid exhaustion

This produces:

* confidence
* speed
* volatility
* crash dynamics

The structure explains both ascent and failure.

---

### 6.7 Opioids — Global Low-Cost Settlement

Opioid intoxication is characterized by:

* inertia over-dominance
* suppression of exploratory bias
* collapse toward minimal-cost continuations
* settlement without expansion

This produces:

* relief
* narrowing
* persistence
* resistance to reorganization

This profile contrasts directly with non-addictive intoxication.

---

## 7. Ownership, Agency, and Responsibility Under Intoxication

Under IER:

* resolution remains **owned**
* intrinsic constraint remains **internally borne**
* the subject remains **categorically intact**

What changes is not *who* resolves, but **how resolution unfolds**.

Responsibility may attenuate due to altered cost landscapes.
Standing does not.

No possession, hijacking, or self-loss is implied.

---

## 8. Intoxication, Psychopathology, and Addiction (Boundary Clarification)

IER distinguishes:

* **Intoxication**
  Reversible, externally induced modulation of resolution geometry

* **Psychopathology**
  Internally sustained, systematic deformation of resolution stages

* **Addiction**
  Deep attractor formation in choice topology where intoxication becomes structurally recruited

These categories may interact.
They must not be conflated.

---

## 9. Interpretive Guardrails

Nothing in this document licenses the inference that:

* intoxicated experience reveals truth
* altered meaning confers epistemic authority
* intensity implies depth
* coherence implies correctness
* conviction implies accuracy

Experiential structure **never** licenses belief about mind-independent reality.

---

## 10. Why One Map Is Sufficient

Intoxication does not require:

* new faculties
* new subjects
* new mechanisms
* new explanatory layers

It requires only:

* altered cost distributions
* shifted timing
* modified stability
* preserved ownership

The same resolution machinery explains:

* sober action
* intoxication
* psychopathology
* addiction

No multiplication is necessary.

## Intermission — Structural Fact

> *Resolution does not become unowned when its geometry is altered.*
> *Alteration changes what resolves — not who bears it.*
