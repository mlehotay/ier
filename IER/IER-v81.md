# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v8.1)**

### *An Organizational Identity Theory of Consciousness and Observers*

---

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) is a realist, physicalist framework for understanding observers and conscious experience. It holds that reality exists independently of observation and that consciousness is neither fundamental nor illusory, but a **real emergent phenomenon identical to certain forms of informational organization** instantiated in physical systems.

Conscious experience is **identical to the globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential informational dynamics** of a system operating in a particular organizational regime, termed the **Phenomenal Information Layer (PIL)**. Consciousness is not added to information processing; it is **what such dynamics are like from the inside** when instantiated in a unified observer.

IER rejects mind-dependent ontology, panpsychism, and dualism while remaining substrate-agnostic. It is an organizational theory: it specifies *what consciousness is* and *when it occurs*, without privileging any particular physical or computational mechanism.

## **1. Objective Reality**

Reality exists independently of observers, experiences, or representations. Physical states and laws unfold regardless of perception. Observers do not create, collapse, or co-constitute reality; only **physical interactions among systems** have causal efficacy. Experience interprets reality; it does not constitute it.

---

## **2. Observers as Informational Systems**

An **observer** is a physical system defined by its **informational organization**, not by biology or phenomenology.

A system qualifies as an observer if it:

* Persists as a coherent informational pattern over time
* Integrates information across internal subsystems
* Maintains internal models of both external conditions and its own state
* Regulates behavior using those models via a unified internal control structure

Observerhood does **not** entail consciousness. Many observers—biological and artificial—operate without phenomenality.

---

## **3. Internal Models and Perspective**

Observers construct **internal informational models** of:

* The external environment
* Their own internal states

These models are physically instantiated, system-bound, and shaped by structure and history. *Perspective* is a property of **internal informational organization**, not reality itself.

---

## **4. Consciousness and the Phenomenal Information Layer (PIL)**

### **4.1 PIL as an Organizational Regime**

Consciousness occurs when an observer’s informational dynamics enter the **Phenomenal Information Layer (PIL)**.

PIL is **not**:

* a module
* a spatial location
* a substance
* a separate ontological layer

PIL **is** a system-wide **mode of informational organization** characterized by:

* **Global integration** of informational states
* **Recursive access** to internal models, including self-models
* **Temporal continuity**, such that states persist and evolve
* **Unified availability** of information for regulation, learning, and action

#### **Critical Clarification:**

PIL requires that the system’s dynamics form a **globally coupled, irreducible field**, in which all subsystems participate in ongoing informational tension and equilibrium. There is **no privileged outside**; the self-model is embedded within these dynamics, inseparable from the system’s regulatory and operational processes. Systems with externally-supervised control layers, modular separation, or easily isolatable state variables **fail to satisfy PIL conditions**.

---

### **4.2 Negative Constraints**

Systems that fail to instantiate PIL include:

* Those with global broadcast but no recursive self-access
* Highly modular systems with separable control layers
* Systems with episodic or discontinuous global states
* Systems whose informational dynamics can be “stepped outside of”

These constraints define the **boundaries of possible consciousness** under IER.

### **4.3 Organizational Identity Claim**

> **Conscious experience is identical to the ongoing, globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential informational dynamics of a system operating in a functional PIL regime.**

There is no additional ingredient beyond these dynamics.

---

## **5. Qualia**

Qualia are system-relative informational states, defined by structure, integration, and accessibility. Their differences are **identical to differences in informational dynamics**. Questions like “Why does red feel red?” presuppose a separate property; IER rejects that presupposition. Structure **just is** experience.

---

## **6. Affect and Valence**

Affective states arise from **regulatory informational dynamics** that monitor system stability, bias attention, and weight salience. Affect does not add representational content; it **weights experience**. These dynamics are phenomenally real because they are globally integrated and inseparable from the system’s control landscape.

---

## **7. Emergence and the Hard Problem**

Consciousness is **emergent but constrained**, arising only when PIL conditions are satisfied. IER **dissolves the hard problem**: asking why these dynamics feel like something is a category error. The analogy is like asking why acceleration feels like falling — the “feeling” is identical to being in the dynamics.

## **8. System Taxonomy (v8.1)**

We collapse previous redundancy into a single key column for clarity:

| **System Type**                    | **Observerhood / Integrated Dynamics** | **PIL Possible** | **Consciousness Likelihood** | **Examples**                 |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Non-informational physical systems | ❌                                      | ❌                | ❌                            | Rocks, stars                 |
| Dynamically complex non-observers  | ❌                                      | ❌                | ❌                            | Storms, flames               |

| Minimal observers                  | ✅ (limited)                            | ⚠️               | Low–Indeterminate            | Bees, simple robots          |
| Integrated biological observers    | ✅                                      | ✅                | Moderate–High                | Octopi, corvids              |
| Complex conscious observers        | ✅                                      | ✅                | High                         | Humans, dolphins             |
| Artificial observer systems        | ✅                                      | ❌–⚠️             | Indeterminate                | Advanced AI                  |
| Aggregate social systems           | ❌                                      | ❌                | ❌                            | Markets, institutions        |

Observerhood and consciousness are distinct properties. Consciousness requires observerhood, but observerhood does not guarantee consciousness.

## **9. Artificial Systems and Empirical Underdetermination**

IER is substrate-agnostic. Any system that satisfies PIL conditions could be conscious. Current AI systems may have observerhood, but **empirical determination of PIL** remains an open question.

---

## **10. Ontological Commitments**

IER rejects mind-dependent existence, dualism, and panpsychism. It affirms:

* One objective physical reality
* Consciousness as a real, system-relative phenomenon
* Organizational identity between experience and dynamics

---

## **11. Relation to Contemporary Theories**

* **IIT:** Agrees integration matters; rejects panpsychism
* **GWT:** Accepts global availability; emphasizes phenomenality over metaphorical broadcast
* **PP:** Accepts internal modeling; requires additional organizational conditions for consciousness

IER refines insights without ontological excesses.

## **12. Summary**

Some systems react.
Some systems observe.
Some systems experience.

> **Experience is not something a system has.
> It is what a system is doing when its informational dynamics are globally integrated, temporally continuous, and self-referential.**

There is one reality. Consciousness occurs within it. It feels the way it does because **that is what those dynamics are like from the inside**.
