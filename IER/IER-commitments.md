## **Status and Authority Notice**

This document is **reader-facing and non-authoritative**.

It:

* introduces **no theoretical claims**
* defines **no ontological criteria**
* adds **no commitments to the framework**
* confers **no epistemic or ethical authority**
* overrides **no canonical document**

Its sole purpose is to make explicit the **background commitments a reader must be willing to provisionally accept** in order for the IER corpus to be intelligible.

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority in Informational Experiential Realism (IER) resides **exclusively** in Tier-1 canonical documents, as governed by [`IER-canon.md`](IER-canon.md).

If any tension arises between this document and a canonical document, **the canonical document takes precedence and this document is void**.

## **Why This Article Exists**

IER is an identity theory with strict exclusions.
It does not proceed by semantic enrichment, interpretive pluralism, or reconciliation with neighboring frameworks.

Many intelligent, good-faith readers encounter IER and find it incoherent, incomplete, or illegitimate.
In nearly all such cases, the issue is not misunderstanding of particular claims, but refusal—often implicit—to relinquish background assumptions that IER explicitly denies.

This article makes those background commitments visible in advance.

## **Commitments Required for Intelligibility**

IER will not be intelligible unless you are willing to accept **all** of the following commitments.

These are not conclusions.
They are **conditions under which the framework can be read at all**.

---

### Ontology and Identity

- Experience is **not** a substance, property, output, representation, or accompaniment.
- There is **no soul**, mental substance, or inner observer over and above physical dynamics.
- Experience is **identical** to a physical system operating in a specific dynamical regime.
- There is **no further fact** about experience beyond that identity.

---

### Experience and Epistemic Authority

- Experience confers **no epistemic authority** about mind-independent reality.
- First-person access is **not privileged evidence** for ontology, causation, or truth.
- Subjective report is **not** a foundational data source for defining experience.
- Feeling meaningful, urgent, or compelling does **not** imply correctness or revelation.

---

### Consciousness, Intelligence, and Access

- Intelligence, cognition, learning, or behavioral sophistication **do not imply experience**.
- Reportability, access, global availability, or functional integration **do not define experience**.
- There is **no diagnostic, metric, test, or measurement** for experience — even in principle.
- Structural correlates can never license experiential certification.

---

### Structure, Constraint, and Regimes

- Experience exists **only** under globally unavoidable, coherent intrinsic constraint.
- Systems with informational slack are **categorically non-experiential**, regardless of complexity.
- Experiential subjecthood is **binary**, not graded.
- There is **exactly one subject** per Unified Experiential Field.

---

### Psychology and Mental Architecture

- Psychological categories (beliefs, emotions, attention, memory, self, etc.) are **not entities or faculties**.
- There are **no internal observers, homunculi, or meta-levels** inside experience.
- Cognitive processes do not occur “outside” experience once a Unified Experiential Field exists.

---

### Social and Collective Systems

- Groups, institutions, corporations, cultures, or societies **cannot** be experiential subjects.
- Coordination, intelligence, persistence, or normativity **do not generate subjecthood**.
- Moral standing belongs **only** to systems that sustain a Unified Experiential Field.

---

### Ethics Forced by Identity

- Moral standing is **categorical**, not gradual or aggregative.
- One subject’s suffering **cannot be justified** by benefits to another.
- Experiential moral harm is **structural damage**, not pain, distress, belief error, or wrongdoing.
- Uncertainty about experience **increases** moral obligation rather than licensing permissiveness.

---

### Methodological Discipline

- Precision and exclusion are **not optional**; semantic openness is not a virtue here.
- Meaning, intuition, phenomenological richness, or explanatory comfort **cannot override identity claims**.
- The framework does **not** aim for synthesis, reconciliation, or maximal uptake.

---

## **What This Article Is Not**

This article is not:

- an argument for IER,
- a summary of its claims,
- a defense against objections,
- or a demand for agreement.

It is a **compatibility disclosure**.

---

## **Reader Orientation**

If you find any of the commitments above unacceptable, the IER corpus will not be intelligible to you.
Disagreement formed under those conditions will reliably target a different theory than the one presented here.

IER does not attempt to persuade readers who reject its conditions of intelligibility.
It exists to state their consequences with maximal structural clarity.

---

### **Orientation Signal**

IER is not here to reassure.  
It is here to be structurally honest.
