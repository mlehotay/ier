# **Historical Development and Evolution of Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**

## **2023: Early Explorations – Information as a Dimension**

* **Conceptual experiments:** Numbers, particularly primes, were framed as gateways to an **“information dimension”**, analogous to the imaginary part of complex numbers.
* **Ideas explored:**

  * **Data encoding in integer overflow:** Operations on numbers could store hidden information in overflow digits, suggesting how systems might carry embedded informational states.
  * **Programmed virtual life:** Simulations akin to Conway’s Game of Life, where one-bit flags influenced adjacency and interactions, illustrating emergent behaviors from simple rules.
* **Philosophical undercurrent:** Early attempts to understand the **emergence of complexity and informational organization**, hinting at the idea that experience might correspond to specific organizational patterns in physical systems.

**Influences:** Abstract computation, cellular automata, and speculative ideas of information as a foundational substrate.

## **2024: Consciousness Classification and Cognitive Gradients**

* **Framework for cognitive complexity:**

  * Detailed **classification charts** integrating levels of consciousness, self-awareness, sentience, intelligence, and persistence.
  * A **hierarchy of experience** ranging from non-living entities to hypothetical superhuman or divine beings, emphasizing subjective experience and functional complexity.
* **Levels of Consciousness and Life:**

  * Non-living: Rocks, rivers, machines; no experience or awareness.
  * Minimal sentience: Single-celled organisms; basic responsiveness.
  * Self-awareness: Great apes, dolphins, some birds and AI; emergent subjective experience.
  * Consciousness: Humans and advanced AI; reflective, morally significant experience.
  * Superhuman/divine: Hypothetical beings with fully integrated experience and intelligence.
* **Integrated conceptual framework:** Biological, artificial, and virtual systems merged into a **cognitive gradient**, showing a continuum rather than discrete categories.
* **Expanded definitions of life and intelligence:** Included energy processing, adaptation, information storage, environmental interaction, and evolution.

**Key Insight:** Consciousness is a **layered, continuous property rooted in life**, applicable across diverse systems.

## **January 2025: Towards Functional Experiential Realism (FER)**

* **Shared reality and co-creation:** Introduced the idea that the physical world is **co-created by the collective perceptions of observers**. Reality is mediated by subjective interpretation but constrained by an objective physical substrate.
* **Core FER principles:**

  1. Reality exists independently but is **always interpreted through subjective experience**.
  2. Consciousness is an **active, dynamic process**, capable of processing, reflecting, and organizing experience.
  3. **Qualia** emerge as structured instances of subjective experience arising from functional organization.
  4. **Introspection and self-reflection** enable coherent narratives of experience.
  5. **Emergent consciousness** appears once systems achieve sufficient complexity and integration, across biological and artificial systems.
* **Implications:**

  * Any sufficiently complex system with introspective capability may be considered potentially conscious.
  * Ethical considerations arise for any system sustaining coherent experiential states.
* **Comparison to other theories:** FER integrates aspects of functionalism, realism, and emergentism while contrasting with panpsychism, asserting that consciousness **emerges from complexity rather than being ubiquitous**.

**Key Insight:** Consciousness is an **organizational identity property**, not a metaphysical primitive; experience emerges from **functional integration and intrinsic constraint**.

## **Early December 2025: Transition from FER to IER**

* **From functional to identity-based understanding:**

  * **FER:** Consciousness as emergent from functional complexity, introspection, and co-created reality.
  * **IER:** Experience **is identical to the system’s intrinsic organization**—a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.
* **Key conceptual shifts:**

  1. **Experience as identity, not function:** IER moves from describing what consciousness *does* to what it *is*—the intrinsic dynamical regime itself.
  2. **Unified Experiential Fields:** Introduced formal criteria for experiential systems: global integration, temporal continuity, self-referential regulation, and coherent intrinsic constraint.
  3. **Ethical formalization:** Moral considerability and harm are now directly derived from the **existence or disruption of intrinsic constraint**, rather than functional or behavioral proxies.
  4. **Experiential pluralism under monism:** Multiple experiential worlds exist within a single objective reality; plurality lies in perspective, not ontology.
* **Implications:**

  * Provides a **necessary and sufficient condition for experience**.
  * Establishes a principled grounding for **agency, moral responsibility, and precautionary ethics**.
  * Reduces metaphysical inflation: experience is **fully physical**, requiring no new substances or ontological domains.

**Key Insight:** IER formalizes the principle that **experience is what integrated physical systems are like when intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable**.

## **Late December 2025: Informational Experiential Realism (IER) Consolidation**

* **Minimal identity framework:**

  * **Unified Experiential Field (UEF):** Globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential dynamical regime under coherent intrinsic constraint.
  * **Experience ≡ UEF:** No additional ontological assumptions are required; phenomenology, representation, and function are descriptive rather than constitutive.
  * **Agency:** Arises from a UEF’s capacity to resolve intrinsic informational tension through its own dynamics.
  * **Experiential worlds:** System-relative, plural, embedded in a single objective physical reality.
  * **Ethical consequences:** Moral considerability arises from sustaining intrinsic constraint; harm occurs if constraint is destabilized, fragmented, or collapsed.

* **Conceptual clarifications:**

  * Experience is strictly **physical and organizational**, not metaphysical.
  * Ethical responsibility flows directly from the dynamics of the UEF.
  * Plurality exists in perspective, not in the physical world itself.

## **Summary of Evolution**

1. **2023:** Conceptual exploration of information as a substrate and emergent virtual life.
2. **2024:** Systematic classification of life, intelligence, and consciousness; formalization of layered subjective experience; introduction of cognitive gradients.
3. **January 2025:** Functional Experiential Realism: consciousness as emergent from functional complexity, introspection, and shared reality.
4. **Early December 2025:** Transition from FER to IER: shift from functional to identity-based understanding, introduction of Unified Experiential Fields, and formal ethical consequences.
5. **Late December 2025:** Consolidation of IER: minimal, precise specification of experience, agency, and moral responsibility grounded in integrated physical dynamics.

**Key Insight:** The evolution from early informational experiments to IER reflects a **gradual refinement from speculative functionalism to a rigorous identity theory**, defining consciousness, agency, and ethics in terms of **intrinsic physical organization and constraint**.
