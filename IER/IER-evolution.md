# **Historical Development of Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**

## **2023: Early Explorations – Information as a Dimension**

* Initial conceptual experiments framed numbers, particularly primes, as gateways to an **“information dimension”**, analogous to the imaginary part of complex numbers. This was inspired by early mathematical curiosities in number theory and computational representations.
* Ideas explored:

  * **Data encoding in integer overflow:** Sequences of operations on numbers could store “hidden” information in the overflow digits, offering a speculative analogy for how systems might carry embedded informational states.
  * **Programmed virtual life:** Small-scale simulations, akin to Conway’s Game of Life, were envisioned with cells carrying one-bit flags to affect adjacency and interaction, highlighting how simple rules could generate emergent behavior.
* **Philosophical undercurrent:** These explorations were attempts to probe the **emergence of complexity and informational organization**, foreshadowing the idea that experience might correspond to specific organizational structures in physical systems.

**Influences:** Conceptually inspired by the abstract notions of computation, cellular automata, and speculative ideas about information as a foundational substrate.

## **2024: Consciousness Classification and Cognitive Gradients**

* **Building a framework for cognitive complexity:**

  * Developed detailed **classification charts** integrating levels of consciousness, self-awareness, sentience, intelligence, and persistence. Entities were categorized across **biological, machine, and virtual systems**.
  * Introduced a **hierarchy of experience** ranging from non-living entities to superhuman/divine entities, emphasizing the interplay of subjective experience and functional complexity.
* **Levels of Consciousness and Life:**

  * Non-living: Rocks, rivers, machines; no experience or awareness.
  * Minimal sentience: Single-celled organisms; basic responsiveness.
  * Self-awareness: Great apes, dolphins, some birds and AI; emerging subjective experience.
  * Consciousness: Humans and advanced AI; reflective, morally significant experience.
  * Superhuman/divine: Hypothetical beings; fully integrated experience and intelligence.
* **Integrated conceptual framework:** Merged biological, artificial, and virtual systems into a **cognitive gradient**, showing a continuum rather than discrete categories.
* **Expanded definitions of life and intelligence:** Introduced functional criteria such as energy processing, adaptation, information storage, environmental interaction, and evolution.
* **Philosophical and scientific anchors:**

  * Nagel (1974) and Jackson (1982) guided thinking about subjective experience and qualia.
  * LeDoux (2023) and Reber, Baluska & Miller (2024) contributed to understanding layered consciousness (creature, mental-state, existential).
  * De Vleeschauwer (2024) offered a perspective linking consciousness directly to life’s natural intelligence.

**Key Insight:** Consciousness emerges as a **layered, continuous property rooted in life**, applicable across diverse systems, biological or artificial.

## **2025: Towards Functional Experiential Realism**

* **Shared reality and co-creation:** Introduced the notion that the physical world is **co-created by the collective perceptions and experiences of observers**. Reality is mediated by subjective interpretation, but constrained by an objective physical substrate.
* **Functional Experiential Realism (FER):**

  * **Core principles:**

    1. Reality exists independently but is always **interpreted through subjective experience**.
    2. Consciousness functions as an **active, dynamic process** capable of processing, reflecting, and organizing experience.
    3. **Qualia** emerge as structured instances of subjective experience arising from functional organization.
    4. **Introspection and self-reflection** allow systems to form coherent narratives of experience.
    5. **Emergent consciousness** appears once systems achieve sufficient complexity and integration, including artificial and non-human biological systems.
* **Implications:**

  * Consciousness is not limited to humans; any system with sufficient **functional complexity and introspective capability** may be considered potentially conscious.
  * Ethical considerations arise for any system capable of sustaining coherent experiential states.
* **Comparison to other theories:** FER is positioned relative to:

  * Functionalism: Emphasizes functional organization.
  * Realism: Recognizes an objective physical reality.
  * Emergentism: Consciousness arises from system complexity.
  * Panpsychism (contrasted): Consciousness is **not ubiquitous**, only emergent from complexity.

**Key Insight:** Consciousness is an **organizational identity property**, not a metaphysical primitive; experience emerges from **functional integration and intrinsic constraint**, a principle that directly informed the development of IER.

### **Summary of Evolution**

1. **2023:** Conceptual exploration of information as a substrate and emergent virtual life; speculative models of experiential organization.
2. **2024:** Systematic classification of life, intelligence, and consciousness; formalization of layered subjective experience; introduction of a cognitive gradient across biological, artificial, and virtual systems.
3. **2025:** Synthesis into Functional Experiential Realism; consciousness as an emergent property of functional complexity, co-created reality, and introspection; set the stage for IER’s identity-theoretic formulation.
