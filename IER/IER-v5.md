# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v5)**

*A Unified Framework for Observers, Experience, and Consciousness*

---

## **Overview**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a theory of mind and consciousness grounded in **physical realism** and **informational organization**. Reality exists independently of observers and is governed entirely by physical processes. Observers do not create or co-create reality; they are **physical systems embedded within it** that construct internal informational models of the world.

Within this framework, minds, observers, and conscious subjects are understood as **informational systems** whose organization enables persistence, self-monitoring, and, in some cases, conscious experience. Consciousness is **emergent**, arising when a system’s informational dynamics achieve a particular form of integration, rather than being fundamental to reality.

## **Core Commitments**

### **1. Objective Reality**

Reality exists independently of observation. Physical states, events, and laws unfold regardless of perception. Observers do not influence reality through thought or perspective; only **physical interactions** among systems causally affect the world.

Experience interprets reality—it does not alter it.

---

### **2. Observers as Informational Systems**

An **observer** is defined not by biology or subjective experience, but by **informational organization**. A system qualifies as an observer when it:

* Persists as a coherent informational pattern over time
* Integrates information across subsystems
* Monitors and updates internal representations of its own state
* Maintains a unified internal perspective from which information is processed

This organization can be instantiated in biological organisms, artificial systems, or distributed physical processes. Consciousness is **not required** for observerhood.

---

### **3. Internal Models and Perspective**

All observers construct **internal informational models** of the external world and their own state. These models are:

* Physically realized within the system
* Entirely internal and system-bound
* Shaped by the system’s structure, history, and constraints

Perspective is a property of **internal information organization**, not reality itself. Different observers may model the same reality differently without changing it.

### **4. Consciousness and the Phenomenal Information Layer**

Conscious experience arises in observers whose informational dynamics form a **Phenomenal Information Layer (PIL)**. The PIL is characterized by:

* Recursive access to internal models
* Temporal continuity of informational states
* Integration of information across subsystems
* Global availability of information for regulation, learning, and action

Consciousness is not a separate substance. It is **the manifestation of integrated information within a self-monitoring system**. Statements like “I feel pain” reflect the system’s internal access to its own informational states, not a non-physical entity.

---

### **5. Qualia**

Qualia are **system-relative informational states**, defined by their structure, integration, and accessibility within the system. They are:

* Physically instantiated
* Accessible only to the system itself
* Differentiated by patterns of integration and internal availability

Qualia are **not intrinsic properties of the external world**; their apparent privacy arises from the system’s exclusive access.

---

### **6. Affect and Valence**

Affective states (pain, pleasure, attraction, aversion) emerge from **regulatory informational processes** that:

* Monitor conditions relevant to system stability
* Bias attention, learning, and behavior
* Assign salience and priority to internal states

Affect reflects **functionally real informational states** that guide system organization and adaptive behavior.

---

### **7. Emergence and Constraints**

Consciousness is **emergent but constrained**. It appears only when a system demonstrates:

* Integration across subsystems
* Recursive self-modeling
* Temporal continuity
* Coordinated access to information for regulation and control

Many complex systems fail to satisfy these criteria and therefore do not experience consciousness.

❌ = absent, ⚠️ = partial/limited, ✅ = clearly present

### **9. Non-Human Biological Systems**

Observer and consciousness capacities vary across species. Systems with limited integration or modular information processing may be observers without sustaining conscious experience. Systems exhibiting widespread integration, flexible learning, and unified regulation are more likely to be conscious.

Consciousness depends on **functional organization**, not species membership.

---

### **10. Reality and Layering**

IER rejects:

* Layered ontologies of reality
* Mind-dependent existence
* Observer-generated worlds

There is **one objective physical reality**, and internal informational processes occur **within systems embedded in that reality**. Conscious experience is **internal and system-bound**, not external or co-creative.

---

## **Conclusion**

Informational Experiential Realism provides a unified framework linking physical reality, observerhood, and consciousness. Consciousness is **real but emergent**, arising when information flows through a system capable of integrated self- and world-modeling over time.

Some systems react. Some observe. Some experience.

IER explains **how and why**.
