# **IER Changelog**

## **Informational Experiential Realism — Version History**

This changelog records **conceptual, structural, and governance-level changes** to the IER framework.
It does **not** list minor edits, wording tweaks, formatting changes, or routine refactors.

---

## **v9.x — Exploratory Era (Deprecated)**

**Status:** Archived
**Character:** Pre-identity exploration

* Multiple competing framings of experience
* Functional, gradualist, and proto-ethical sketches
* No fixed ontology or authority discipline

**Outcome:**
Abandoned in favor of a single closed identity claim.

---

## **v10.0 — Identity Lock-In**

**Character:** Foundational release

* Experience fixed as an **identity claim**, not emergence or correlation
* Unified Experiential Field (UEF) introduced as a **regime-level identity**
* Physical monism enforced
* Ethics and mathematics derived from identity
* First strict separation between:

  * normative specification
  * explanation
  * application

**Result:**
IER becomes a theory, not a research program.

---

## **v10.1 — Structural Consolidation**

**Character:** Clarification-only

* Terminology stabilized
* Ontology vs. explanation sharply separated
* Subjecthood vs. participation clarified

No changes to identity conditions.

---

## **v10.2 — Applications & Stress Testing**

**Character:** Demonstrative expansion

* Introduction of non-normative application domains
* Identity claim stress-tested without extension
* All applications explicitly labeled non-authoritative

---

## **v10.3 — Participation Dynamics**

**Character:** Major conceptual clarification

* Explicit distinction between:

  * UEF identity
  * experiential participation

* Regime transition separated from participation modulation

* Eliminated misreadings involving partial subjects or subject multiplication

Closes a major loophole.

---

## **v10.4 — Persistence and Agency**

**Character:** Diachronic clarification

* Persistence explained without serial subjects
* Agency formalized as **derived**, not primitive
* Clear separation between agency and control

---

## **v10.5 — Architectural Hardening**

**Character:** Canon consolidation

* Identity claim hardened against functionalist and representational creep
* Structural equivalence arguments expanded
* Redundancy reduced across the corpus

---

## **v10.6 — Normative Closure**

**Character:** Finalization

* Identity conditions fixed
* No diagnostics or thresholds permitted in principle
* Subjecthood categorical and non-gradable
* Ethical consequences fixed by identity
* Experiential access explicitly non-epistemic

After v10.6, no new normative commitments are permitted.

---

## **v10.7 — Specification Precision**

**Character:** Tightening pass

* Information explicitly non-primitive
* UEF system boundaries normatively fixed
* Single-UEF dominance clarified
* Observer language removed from normative roles
* Epistemic non-authority enforced

Removes remaining specification ambiguities.

---

## **v10.8 — Structural Closure (Final Normative Release)**

**Status:** **Normatively Closed**
**Character:** Hardening without expansion

No new primitives.
No new ethical commitments.

Key outcomes:

* Converts intuitive claims into **structural impossibility arguments**:

  * no experience in slack-admitting systems
  * no multiple dominant UEFs

* Structural non-diagnosability made explicit

* Scoped precaution principle finalized

* Canon reduced and authority tiers enforced

* Accepted theoretical costs explicitly acknowledged

**Design goal achieved:**
IER becomes structurally unavoidable rather than stipulative.

---

## **v10.8.1 — Corpus Completion and Misuse Hardening (Patch)**

**Status:** Patch release
**Character:** Clarification, completion, and governance alignment

**No ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical commitments changed.**

This release completes and seals the IER corpus without modifying any identity claims or ethical entailments fixed in **v10.8**.

**Key outcomes:**

* **Corpus completion**

  * All intended documents finalized, tiered, and inventoried
  * IER transitions from an evolving manuscript to a closed, publishable system

* **Governance clarified**

  * Canon (`IER-canon.md`) separated from corpus inventory (`IER-manifest.md`)
  * Prevents accidental authority inflation

* **Relational regimes completed**

  * Full structural account of multi-subject relationships without fusion, collectivization, or shared subjecthood
  * Blocks relational aggregation and identity-fusion misreadings

* **Experiential interruption clarified**

  * Sleep, anesthesia, dormancy, and unconsciousness treated as regime interruptions, not degraded experience
  * Eliminates partial-experience and subject-multiplication confusions

* **Negative-space hardened**

  * Structural impossibility results finalized for diagnostics, informational slack, and institutional subjecthood
  * Prevents certification, detection, and collective-standing misapplications

**Interpretive note:**
**v10.8.1 marks IER as fully sealed, navigable, and misuse-hardened.**
Post-closure work is limited to clarification, pedagogy, application, and critique.

---

## **v10.8.2 — Corpus Expansion & Publication Tooling (Patch)**

**Status:** Released
**Character:** Non-normative expansion, structural alignment, and build stabilization

**No ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical commitments were changed.**
All normative authority remains fixed at **v10.8 / v10.8.1**.

This release incorporates substantial **Tier-2 and Tier-4 explanatory material**, along with governance, build, and publication infrastructure needed to reliably assemble and validate the IER corpus.

**Key updates:**

* Added and revised multiple non-normative explanatory articles
* Completed relational, phenomenological, and regime-interruption coverage
* Finalized canon, manifest, and tier enforcement
* Implemented manifest-driven book assembly and validation tooling
* Stabilized Pandoc / LaTeX rendering for paper and book outputs

**Interpretive note:**
v10.8.2 reflects a **material expansion of explanatory coverage** and a **maturation of publication infrastructure**, without reopening normative commitments.

---

## **v10.8.3 — Saturation, Hardening, and Corpus Expansion (Patch)**

**Status:** Released
**Character:** Defensive articulation and unplanned completion

**No ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical commitments were changed.**
All normative authority remains fixed at **v10.8 / v10.8.1**.

This release completes IER’s **misreading resistance and evaluation stability**, while also incorporating a larger-than-planned expansion of non-normative explanatory material that proved necessary to close recurrent confusions.

### **Key outcomes:**

* **Saturation articulated**

  * Added a full structural account of **informational saturation** explaining how informational slack disappears
  * No new identity conditions, thresholds, or diagnostics introduced

* **Misuse and rubric hardening**

  * Centralized mandatory non-inferences (no nested subjects, no thresholds, no implementation-independence drift, no autopoiesis)
  * Completed explanandum, correlates, diagnostics, falsifiability, and rubric defenses
  * Explicitly separated identity claims from detection, evaluation, and engineering expectations

* **Substantial corpus expansion (unplanned)**

  * Added major Tier-2 and Tier-3 documents clarifying:

    * cognition, psychology, narrative self, memory, forgetting, participation, and architecture
    * intelligence and engineering limits
    * correlates, diagnostics, and scope boundaries
  * Added comparison materials and structured reading paths to stabilize external engagement

### **Interpretive note:**

**v10.8.3 marks the point at which IER becomes evaluation-stable and corpus-complete against predictable misreadings.**

---

## **v10.8.4 — Diachronic Organization (Focused Completion)**

**Status:** Patch
**Normative impact:** None
**Canon status:** v10.8 remains normatively closed

### **Intent**

Complete IER’s account of **time-extended experiential organization** without introducing new primitives, criteria, diagnostics, or authority.

All changes make **implicit structural consequences explicit**, improving coherence, alignment, and misuse resistance.

### **Key Changes**

* **Experiential moral harm clarified as a genus**

  * Explicitly distinguishes multiple organizational damage modes.
  * No new harm kinds, thresholds, or obligations.
  * `IER-harm.md` updated accordingly.

* **Diachronic organization completed across cognition, agency, and identity**

  * Memory and forgetting treated structurally (history and participation), not as storage or erasure.
  * Added anterograde amnesia appendix to `IER-forgetting.md`.
  * Identity grounded in forward constraint ownership, not recall.
  * Agency, responsibility, skill, mood, attention, and development unified as time-extended constraint reorganization.
  * Clarifies persistence through change without subject multiplication or replacement.

* **Futures framing reworked**

  * Sharp distinction between **admissible futures** (structural) and **anticipated futures** (epistemic).
  * Blocks belief- and expectation-based smuggling into ethics and responsibility.

* **Topology-based synthesis**

  * Added `IER-topology.md` (and companion material).
  * Unifies time, identity, memory, agency, possibility, and harm as shared constraint structure.
  * Explanatory only; no ontological or diagnostic claims.

* **New explanatory ethics applications**

  * Added `IER-gaslighting.md`, `IER-propaganda.md`, and `IER-masochism.md` (all non-normative).

### **Non-Changes (Explicit)**

This release does **not** modify:

* experiential identity claims
* categorical standing or onset
* responsibility structure
* epistemic limits or non-diagnosability
* canon authority or versioning rules

> **v10.8.4 improves compression, clarity, and alignment without altering any binding commitments.**
