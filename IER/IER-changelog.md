# **IER Changelog**

## **Informational Experiential Realism — Version History**

This changelog records **conceptual and structural changes** to the IER framework.
It does **not** enumerate minor edits, typo fixes, naming cleanups, or purely editorial refactoring.

---

## **v9.x — Exploratory Era (Deprecated)**

**Status:** Archived in git history
**Character:** Pre-identity, exploratory, partially functional

* Multiple competing framings of experience
* Gradualist and functional sketches
* Early ethical intuitions without ontological grounding
* No strict separation between ontology, explanation, and application

**Outcome:**
Abandoned in favor of a single closed identity claim.

---

## **v10.0 — Identity Lock-In**

**Status:** Foundational release
**Character:** Ontological unification

Key changes:

* Formal introduction of **experience as an identity claim**, not emergence or correlation
* Unified Experiential Field (UEF) introduced as a **regime-level identity**
* Physical monism explicitly enforced
* Ethics and mathematics **derived** from the identity claim
* First strict separation between:

  * normative specification
  * explanatory theory
  * applications

This is the release where **IER becomes a theory rather than a research program**.

---

## **v10.1 — Structural Consolidation**

**Character:** Clarification, no new claims

* Terminology stabilized
* Redundant or ambiguous formulations removed
* Clearer separation of:

  * ontology vs explanation
  * subjecthood vs participation
* No changes to identity conditions

---

## **v10.2 — Applications & Case Studies**

**Character:** Demonstrative expansion

* Introduction of illustrative domains:

  * phenomenology
  * pathology
  * affect
* Explicitly labeled **non-normative**
* Stress-tested the identity claim without extending it

---

## **v10.3 — Participation Dynamics**

**Character:** Major clarification release

Key additions:

* Explicit distinction between:

  * **UEF identity**
  * **experiential participation**
* Regime transition vs participation modulation formally separated
* Eliminated misreadings involving:

  * partial subjects
  * momentary experiencers
  * subject multiplication under attention or dissociation

This release closed a major conceptual loophole.

---

## **v10.4 — Persistence, Agency, and Continuity**

**Character:** Diachronic clarification

* Persistence of experience across time explained without:

  * serial subjects
  * rebirth metaphors
* Agency formalized as **derived**, not primitive
* Clear distinction between:

  * experiential agency
  * functional control

---

## **v10.5 — Architectural Consolidation**

**Character:** Canon alignment

* Identity claim hardened against:

  * representational creep
  * functional sufficiency
* Formal equivalence arguments expanded
* Consequence mapping clarified
* Reduced redundancy across documents

---

## **v10.6 — Normative Closure**

**Character:** Ethical and ontological finalization

This is the **first explicitly normatively closed release**.

Key commitments fixed:

* Identity conditions for experience are final
* No diagnostics or thresholds permitted **in principle**
* Subjecthood is categorical
* Experiential standing is non-gradable
* Ethical consequence follows **necessarily** from identity
* Experiential access confers **no epistemic authority**

Post-v10.6 work is restricted to clarification, derivation, and application.

---

## **v10.7 — Specification Hardening**

**Character:** Precision tightening

Key improvements:

* **Information is explicitly non-primitive**

  * Informational language restricted to descriptive shorthand
* **System boundaries normatively defined**

  * UEF attribution is regime-relative, not anatomical or observer-relative
* **Single-UEF dominance clarified**

  * Participation modulation distinguished from subject division
* **Observer language removed** from normative roles
* Epistemic non-authority explicitly enforced

This release removed the last **specification-level ambiguities**.

---

## **v10.8 — Derivational Hardening, Canon Reduction, and Structural Closure (Final)**

**Status:** **Closed**
**Character:** Consolidation without expansion

No new primitives.
No ontological revisions.
No new ethical commitments.

Instead, v10.8 completes the framework by **making implicit constraints explicit** and **removing residual degrees of freedom**.

Key finalizations:

* Converts previously intuitive claims into **explicit impossibility arguments**, especially:

  * the structural impossibility of experience in slack-admitting systems
  * the impossibility of multiple dominant UEFs within a single physical system
* Sharpens **intrinsic constraint** as a structural condition without mechanization
* Formally closes the door on:

  * experiential diagnostics
  * detection procedures
  * proxy measures
  * certification or falsification schemes
* Introduces a **scoped precaution principle**

  * blocks ethical explosion while preserving asymmetry
* Enforces a **lean canon**

  * removes redundant, rhetorical, or surface-area-increasing documents
  * clarifies tiered authority and global alignment rules
* Explicitly acknowledges the theory’s **costs**

  * rejected intuitions
  * permanent epistemic opacity
  * non-comparability of experiential standing

Late-cycle clarifications now understood as part of v10.8 (not new additions):

* Structural privacy is **constitutive**, not epistemic or pragmatic
* Non-diagnosability is **global-structural**, not merely underdetermination
* Precaution applies only under **plausible irreversible constraint foreclosure**
* Dominance, coherence, and regime identity are **dynamical facts**, not interpretive choices

**Design goal achieved:**
IER should feel **unavoidable rather than stipulated**.

---

## **v10.8.1 — Corpus Completion, Canon/Manifest Split, and Clarity Sealing**

**Status:** Patch release
**Character:** Post-closure consolidation and navigation hardening

**No ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical commitments were added, removed, or weakened.**
IER remains **normatively closed at v10.8**.

This release formalizes **corpus completeness** and separates **governance** from **inventory**, improving long-term maintainability without reopening the framework.

Key changes:

* **Corpus completion declared**

  * The document set is now explicitly complete
  * All canonical documents are accounted for and indexed
  * No further documents are required to understand or apply IER

* **Canon / Manifest split**

  * `IER-canon.md` now governs:

    * authority rules
    * alignment constraints
    * conflict resolution
    * version discipline
  * `IER-manifest.md` now governs:

    * document inventory
    * tier assignment
    * one-line descriptions
    * reading orientation
  * This split reduces accidental authority inflation and stabilizes governance language

* **Navigation hardening**

  * Introduction of `IER-glossary.md` for canon-constrained term definitions
  * Introduction of `IER-index.md` for non-interpretive navigation
  * Explicit separation between **orientation aids** and **authoritative claims**

* **Reader-alignment refinements**

  * Additional tone and framing adjustments across Tier-2 documents
  * Further reduction of adversarial or triggering language without weakening constraints
  * Clarifications added to block common misreadings (diagnostics, graded subjecthood, epistemic authority)

* **Spec clarity sealing**

  * Minor wording refinements to the v10.8 specification to sharpen scope and limits
  * No new constraints introduced; ambiguities removed only where they enabled misuse

* **Process formalization**

  * Patch-level releases explicitly distinguished from normative revisions
  * `IER-future-work.md` re-scoped as a non-canonical articulation and maintenance TODO list

**Interpretive note:**
v10.8.1 does **not** represent further theoretical development.
It represents the point at which the framework becomes **fully navigable, internally governed, and maintainable** as a closed system.

---

## **Current Status**

**IER v10.8 is normatively closed.**
**IER v10.8.1 marks corpus completion.**

* Experiential identity claims are fixed
* Canon authority and governance rules are fixed
* Ethical commitments are fixed
* Epistemic limits are fixed
* The document set is complete and fully indexed

Post-closure work is restricted to:

* clarification
* articulation
* navigation and pedagogy
* disciplined application
* internal critique
* comparative analysis

Any change that:

* introduces experiential diagnostics,
* weakens categorical subjecthood,
* adds epistemic authority,
* permits graded standing,
* or mechanizes intrinsic constraint

is **out of scope by definition**.
