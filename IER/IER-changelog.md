# **IER Changelog**

## **Informational Experiential Realism — Version History**

This changelog records **conceptual, structural, and governance-level changes** to the IER framework.
It does **not** list minor edits, wording tweaks, formatting changes, or routine refactors.

---

## **v9.x — Exploratory Era (Deprecated)**

**Status:** Archived
**Character:** Pre-identity exploration

* Multiple competing framings of experience
* Functional, gradualist, and proto-ethical sketches
* No fixed ontology or authority discipline

**Outcome:**
Abandoned in favor of a single closed identity claim.

---

## **v10.0 — Identity Lock-In**

**Character:** Foundational release

* Experience fixed as an **identity claim**, not emergence or correlation
* Unified Experiential Field (UEF) introduced as a **regime-level identity**
* Physical monism enforced
* Ethics and mathematics derived from identity
* First strict separation between:

  * normative specification
  * explanation
  * application

**Result:**
IER becomes a theory, not a research program.

---

## **v10.1 — Structural Consolidation**

**Character:** Clarification-only

* Terminology stabilized
* Ontology vs. explanation sharply separated
* Subjecthood vs. participation clarified

No changes to identity conditions.

---

## **v10.2 — Applications & Stress Testing**

**Character:** Demonstrative expansion

* Introduction of non-normative application domains
* Identity claim stress-tested without extension
* All applications explicitly labeled non-authoritative

---

## **v10.3 — Participation Dynamics**

**Character:** Major conceptual clarification

* Explicit distinction between:

  * UEF identity
  * experiential participation

* Regime transition separated from participation modulation

* Eliminated misreadings involving partial subjects or subject multiplication

Closes a major loophole.

---

## **v10.4 — Persistence and Agency**

**Character:** Diachronic clarification

* Persistence explained without serial subjects
* Agency formalized as **derived**, not primitive
* Clear separation between agency and control

---

## **v10.5 — Architectural Hardening**

**Character:** Canon consolidation

* Identity claim hardened against functionalist and representational creep
* Structural equivalence arguments expanded
* Redundancy reduced across the corpus

---

## **v10.6 — Normative Closure**

**Character:** Finalization

* Identity conditions fixed
* No diagnostics or thresholds permitted in principle
* Subjecthood categorical and non-gradable
* Ethical consequences fixed by identity
* Experiential access explicitly non-epistemic

After v10.6, no new normative commitments are permitted.

---

## **v10.7 — Specification Precision**

**Character:** Tightening pass

* Information explicitly non-primitive
* UEF system boundaries normatively fixed
* Single-UEF dominance clarified
* Observer language removed from normative roles
* Epistemic non-authority enforced

Removes remaining specification ambiguities.

---

## **v10.8 — Structural Closure (Final Normative Release)**

**Status:** **Normatively Closed**
**Character:** Hardening without expansion

No new primitives.
No new ethical commitments.

Key outcomes:

* Converts intuitive claims into **structural impossibility arguments**:

  * no experience in slack-admitting systems
  * no multiple dominant UEFs

* Structural non-diagnosability made explicit

* Scoped precaution principle finalized

* Canon reduced and authority tiers enforced

* Accepted theoretical costs explicitly acknowledged

**Design goal achieved:**
IER becomes structurally unavoidable rather than stipulative.

---

## **v10.8.1 — Corpus Completion and Misuse Hardening (Patch)**

**Status:** Patch release
**Character:** Clarification, completion, and governance alignment

**No ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical commitments changed.**

This release completes and seals the IER corpus without modifying any identity claims or ethical entailments fixed in **v10.8**.

**Key outcomes:**

* **Corpus completion**

  * All intended documents finalized, tiered, and inventoried
  * IER transitions from an evolving manuscript to a closed, publishable system

* **Governance clarified**

  * Canon (`IER-canon.md`) separated from corpus inventory (`IER-manifest.md`)
  * Prevents accidental authority inflation

* **Relational regimes completed**

  * Full structural account of multi-subject relationships without fusion, collectivization, or shared subjecthood
  * Blocks relational aggregation and identity-fusion misreadings

* **Experiential interruption clarified**

  * Sleep, anesthesia, dormancy, and unconsciousness treated as regime interruptions, not degraded experience
  * Eliminates partial-experience and subject-multiplication confusions

* **Negative-space hardened**

  * Structural impossibility results finalized for diagnostics, informational slack, and institutional subjecthood
  * Prevents certification, detection, and collective-standing misapplications

**Interpretive note:**
**v10.8.1 marks IER as fully sealed, navigable, and misuse-hardened.**
Post-closure work is limited to clarification, pedagogy, application, and critique.
