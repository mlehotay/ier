# **IER Changelog**

## **Informational Experiential Realism — Version History**

This changelog records **conceptual, structural, and governance-level changes** to the IER framework.
It does **not** list minor edits, wording tweaks, formatting changes, or routine refactors.

---

## **v9.x — Exploratory Era (Deprecated)**

**Status:** Archived
**Character:** Pre-identity exploration

* Multiple competing framings of experience
* Functional, gradualist, and proto-ethical sketches
* No fixed ontology or authority discipline

**Outcome:**
Abandoned in favor of a single closed identity claim.

---

## **v10.0 — Identity Lock-In**

**Character:** Foundational release

* Experience fixed as an **identity claim**, not emergence or correlation
* Unified Experiential Field (UEF) introduced as a **regime-level identity**
* Physical monism enforced
* Ethics and mathematics derived from identity
* First strict separation between:

  * normative specification
  * explanation
  * application

**Result:**
IER becomes a theory, not a research program.

---

## **v10.1 — Structural Consolidation**

**Character:** Clarification-only

* Terminology stabilized
* Ontology vs. explanation sharply separated
* Subjecthood vs. participation clarified

No changes to identity conditions.

---

## **v10.2 — Applications & Stress Testing**

**Character:** Demonstrative expansion

* Introduction of non-normative application domains
* Identity claim stress-tested without extension
* All applications explicitly labeled non-authoritative

---

## **v10.3 — Participation Dynamics**

**Character:** Major conceptual clarification

* Explicit distinction between:

  * UEF identity
  * experiential participation

* Regime transition separated from participation modulation

* Eliminated misreadings involving partial subjects or subject multiplication

Closes a major loophole.

---

## **v10.4 — Persistence and Agency**

**Character:** Diachronic clarification

* Persistence explained without serial subjects
* Agency formalized as **derived**, not primitive
* Clear separation between agency and control

---

## **v10.5 — Architectural Hardening**

**Character:** Canon consolidation

* Identity claim hardened against functionalist and representational creep
* Structural equivalence arguments expanded
* Redundancy reduced across the corpus

---

## **v10.6 — Normative Closure**

**Character:** Finalization

* Identity conditions fixed
* No diagnostics or thresholds permitted in principle
* Subjecthood categorical and non-gradable
* Ethical consequences fixed by identity
* Experiential access explicitly non-epistemic

After v10.6, no new normative commitments are permitted.

---

## **v10.7 — Specification Precision**

**Character:** Tightening pass

* Information explicitly non-primitive
* UEF system boundaries normatively fixed
* Single-UEF dominance clarified
* Observer language removed from normative roles
* Epistemic non-authority enforced

Removes remaining specification ambiguities.

---

## **v10.8 — Structural Closure (Final Normative Release)**

**Status:** **Normatively Closed**
**Character:** Hardening without expansion

No new primitives.
No new ethical commitments.

Key outcomes:

* Converts intuitive claims into **structural impossibility arguments**:

  * no experience in slack-admitting systems
  * no multiple dominant UEFs

* Structural non-diagnosability made explicit

* Scoped precaution principle finalized

* Canon reduced and authority tiers enforced

* Accepted theoretical costs explicitly acknowledged

**Design goal achieved:**
IER becomes structurally unavoidable rather than stipulative.

---

## **v10.8.1 — Corpus Completion & Scope Clarification (Patch)**

**Status:** Patch release
**Character:** Clarification, governance, and alignment

**No ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical commitments changed.**

Key changes:

* **Moral harm scope clarified**

  * Explicitly distinguishes **experiential moral harm** from moral harm in general
  * Blocks misreadings involving unconsciousness, anesthesia, dormancy, and non-experiential violations

* **Ethics-aligned revisions**

  * Updates to `IER-ethics`, `IER-morals`, and `IER-FAQ`
  * Explicit scope discipline added without expanding moral authority

* **Corpus completion declared**

  * Canon marked complete
  * All documents inventoried and tiered

* **Canon / Manifest split**

  * Governance (`IER-canon.md`) separated from inventory (`IER-manifest.md`)
  * Reduces accidental authority inflation

* **Navigation hardening**

  * Glossary and index finalized
  * Reader-facing orientation improved without softening constraints

* **Patch discipline formalized**

  * Patch versions restricted to clarification, pedagogy, and alignment
  * No silent normative drift permitted

**Interpretive note:**
v10.8.1 marks the point where IER becomes **fully sealed, navigable, and maintainable** as a closed system.

---

## **Current Status**

* **IER v10.8** — normatively closed
* **IER v10.8.1** — corpus complete

Post-closure work is limited to:

* clarification and pedagogy
* disciplined application
* internal critique
* comparative analysis

Any change that introduces diagnostics, graded standing, epistemic authority, or optimization principles is **out of scope by definition**.
