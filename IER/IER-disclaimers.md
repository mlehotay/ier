## **Global Interpretive Constraints**

**Tier:** 3 — Misuse & Misreading Containment
**Status:** Non-normative, constraint-enforcing
**Scope:** Global (applies unless explicitly overridden)

---

## **1. Purpose**

This document establishes the **global interpretive constraints** governing all materials associated with **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**.

Its function is to **block illegitimate inferences, category errors, diagnostic moves, and evaluative expectations** that are structurally incompatible with IER, even when such moves appear locally reasonable.

These constraints exist because the **IER identity claim** makes certain familiar interpretive moves **structurally invalid**, not because those moves are unreasonable, naïve, or made in bad faith.

This document introduces:

* **no theoretical claims**
* **no criteria**
* **no diagnostics**
* **no epistemic authority**

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md
```

Where an interpretation conflicts with the constraints below, **the interpretation is invalid under IER**, regardless of plausibility or precedent elsewhere.

---

## **2. Applicability**

The constraints in this document apply **globally** to:

* all IER corpus documents (Tiers 1–4),
* all books and derived publications governed by IER,
* all scholarly, evaluative, or critical engagement explicitly targeting IER.

They apply **by default** and remain in force unless a document **explicitly states otherwise**.

---

## **3. Informational Language Constraint**

All informational language in IER materials is used **descriptively only**, as shorthand for:

> **physically instantiated state distinctions that modulate a system’s own future dynamics under intrinsic constraint**

This usage does **not** introduce or license:

* semantic primitives,
* representations or encodings,
* messages or signals,
* stored content,
* epistemic access relations,
* observer-relative meaning.

Terms such as *information*, *content*, *structure*, *organization*, or *pattern* name **organizational and dynamical facts**, not internal objects.

This restriction does **not** deny the physical legitimacy of information-theoretic, dynamical, or statistical descriptions.
It restricts **only semantic, representational, or epistemic interpretations** of such descriptions.

---

## **4. Anti-Representational Constraint**

IER does **not** posit internal representations, models, symbols, or stored contents as explanatory primitives.

Accordingly:

* “meaning” does **not** imply semantic correspondence,
* “content” does **not** imply encoded entities,
* “structure” does **not** imply internal models.

Readings that treat IER as a representational, computational, semantic, or model-based theory are invalid.

**Clarification:**
This constraint does **not** deny the existence of thought, language use, reference-like behavior, systematic error, or structured cognition.
It denies only that these phenomena require **internal representations as explanatory primitives**.

---

## **5. Anti-Agentive / Anti-Observer Constraint**

IER does **not** presuppose:

* internal observers,
* homunculi,
* executive agents,
* meta-level controllers,
* interpretive subsystems,
* epistemically privileged viewpoints.

No system described by IER “observes,” “interprets,” or “accesses” its own states.

**Clarification (Introspection):**
This does **not** deny introspection. Under IER, what is called “introspection” is a change in experiential organization due to **participation modulation**, not an epistemic act of observing or accessing internal states.

**Clarification (Selfhood):**
This does **not** deny first-person perspective or selfhood. Under IER, perspective and selfhood arise from **unified intrinsic constraint**, not from a system representing or observing itself.

Agency, where discussed, is a **derived organizational phenomenon**, not a primitive source of control or observation.

---

## **6. Non-Diagnostic Constraint**

Nothing in IER materials licenses:

* detection of experience,
* measurement of experience,
* certification of experience,
* empirical inference of experiential status.

Similarity in behavior, performance, report, architecture, or function is **not sufficient evidence** of experience.

This limitation is **structural**, not provisional.

**Clarification:**
This is not a claim about current scientific limitations or missing data.
It follows directly from treating experience as an **identity-level regime property**, not as an output, signal, or observable feature.

Attempts to extract tests, indicators, proxies, or engineering criteria from IER are invalid.

---

## **7. Anti-Epistemic Authority Constraint**

Experiential structure, coherence, unity, salience, or inevitability confers **no epistemic authority** regarding:

* truth,
* correctness,
* reference,
* external reality,
* moral justification.

Feelings of insight, certainty, or necessity are **organizational phenomena**, not evidence.

**Clarification:**
This does **not** imply that experience is epistemically irrelevant.
It denies only that experiential structure, intensity, or conviction functions as **privileged justification or evidence by itself**.

Any reading that treats experience as epistemically privileged is invalid.

---

## **8. Artifact-Role Constraint**

IER materials serve **distinct artifact roles** (e.g. orientation, explanation, foundations, reference, misuse containment).

No single artifact is intended to function as a universal entry point.

Opacity, difficulty, or lack of explanation in a given artifact reflects a **mismatch between the artifact’s role and the reader’s expectations**, not theoretical incoherence, incompleteness, or evasion.

---

## **9. Relation to Other Tier-3 Documents**

This document complements:

* `IER-diagnostics.md` — diagnostic misuse containment
* `IER-rubric.md` — evaluation misuse containment
* `IER-denials.md` — explicit non-claims

Together, these documents define the **Tier-3 misuse-containment layer** of IER.

---

## **10. Change Policy**

This document may be revised to clarify or strengthen misuse boundaries.

Such revisions:

* clarify scope,
* prevent misattribution,
* and reinforce existing constraints,

without introducing new commitments or expanding authority.

Revisions must remain:

* non-normative,
* non-diagnostic,
* non-representational,
* and consistent with categorical non-diagnosability.

---

## **Closing Statement**

These constraints are **structural prohibitions**, not rhetorical hedges.

They do not narrow IER arbitrarily; they follow **necessarily** from its identity claim.

Where these constraints are violated, the result is **not a disagreement with IER** — it is **no longer an interpretation of IER at all**.
