# Informational Experiential Realism (IER v9.4)

**What It’s Like to Be an Informational System**
*or, I Identify as a Reflexive Tensor Field*

An Organizational Identity Theory of Observers and Experience

---

## Abstract

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) is a realist, physicalist framework for understanding observers and lived experience. Reality exists independently of observation. Experience is neither fundamental nor illusory, but a real emergent phenomenon arising from specific forms of informational organization instantiated in physical systems.

IER identifies experience with the globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential informational dynamics of a system that sustains a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**. Experience is not something a system has; it is what a system is doing from the inside when its informational processes are bound together into a unified, irreducible, self-constraining field of activity.

Experience requires **coherent intrinsic informational tension under physical and organizational constraints**. The system’s own integrated dynamics must generate conflicts that cannot be decomposed, offloaded, or externally resolved, yet remain coherently integrated. IER rejects mind-dependent ontology, panpsychism, and dualism while remaining substrate-agnostic. It is an organizational identity theory: it specifies what experience *is* and *when it occurs*, without privileging any particular biological or material implementation.

## 1. Objective Reality

Reality exists independently of observation. Physical states, events, and laws unfold whether or not they are experienced. Observers do not create, collapse, or co-author reality; only physical interactions among systems have causal effect.

Experience does not alter reality. It is a property of **organization within reality**, not a separate ontological layer. Many physical systems evolve dynamically, but without the appropriate integrated organization and intrinsic constraint, there is nothing it is like to be them.

---

## 2. Observers as Informational Systems

An observer is defined by organizational and informational criteria rather than biology or phenomenology. A system qualifies as an observer if it:

* Persists as a coherent informational pattern over time
* Integrates information across internal subsystems
* Maintains internal models of both external conditions and its own state
* Regulates behavior via unified control over those models

Observerhood does not entail experience. Many systems observe, predict, and regulate without sustaining a Unified Experiential Field.

---

## 3. Internal Models and Perspective

Observers construct internal informational models of the world and themselves. These models are physically instantiated and shaped by the system’s structure, history, and constraints. Perspective emerges from organizational structure, not from reality itself.

Different observers may model the same environment differently; these differences do not alter objective reality. They affect only how the system regulates itself.

Internal models are **necessary but not sufficient** for experience. Only processes that are globally integrated into a unified, self-referential, and temporally continuous dynamical regime contribute to what-it-is-like-for-the-system.

---

## 4. The Unified Experiential Field (UEF)

### 4.1 Definition

The **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** is the globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential pattern of informational dynamics in which multiple processes are bound together into a single, irreducible field that constrains system-wide regulation.

UEF is:

* Not a place
* Not a module
* Not a representation
* Not a separate ontological layer

UEF is an **organizational and dynamical regime** of a system.

---

### 4.2 Experiential Participation

An informational process participates in the UEF if and only if it:

* Is globally integrated with other participating processes
* Contributes to temporally continuous system-wide dynamics
* Is internally sustained rather than externally orchestrated
* Exerts and is subject to **intrinsic constraint** from other processes

Processes that are local, transient, modular, or externally resolvable do not participate in the UEF and are therefore non-experiential.

---

### 4.3 Identity Claim

> **Experience is identical to the structure, dynamics, and intrinsic tension profile of the informational processes participating in the UEF.**

No additional property, substance, or inner observer exists. The field’s patterns of flow, constraint, and tension *just are* what-it-is-like for the system.

> “This is what it feels like to run on this hardware.”

The “from the inside” perspective refers to system-relative organization, not a privileged metaphysical viewpoint.

---

### 4.4 Gradual Emergence and Regime Transition

The Unified Experiential Field is not all-or-nothing, but the outcome of a bounded, graded integration process. Systems vary continuously in the strength of coupling, coherence, and mutual dependence among their internal dynamics.

At low integration, informational processes remain fragmented. Such systems may sense, model, and regulate without there being anything it is like to be them.

As coupling increases, coordination improves and regulation becomes more efficient. However, beyond a critical regime, the system’s dynamics begin to **constrain themselves**. Not all internal demands can be simultaneously satisfied, and these conflicts cannot be decomposed or externally resolved.

At this point, integration becomes **intrinsic rather than merely functional**, and a Unified Experiential Field emerges as a dynamical consequence of the system’s own organization.

---

## 5. Informational Slack and Intrinsic Tension

### 5.1 Informational Slack

**Informational slack** is the degree to which integrated informational pathways can absorb, reroute, parallelize, or externalize constraint without generating intrinsic conflict.

Slack is characterized by:

* Redundancy
* Decomposability
* External arbitration
* Conditional independence among processes

Systems with sufficient slack may be complex, adaptive, and observer-like while remaining non-experiential.

---

### 5.2 Informational Tension

**Informational tension** is mutual constraint among integrated processes. It arises only when:

* Multiple system-level demands are jointly active
* Physical or organizational limits prevent simultaneous satisfaction
* Resolution matters to system persistence or regulation

Tension becomes **experiential only when it is intrinsic**:

* Generated and sustained by the system’s own integrated dynamics
* Non-decomposable without loss of system identity
* Not trivially offloaded or externally resolved

Constraint conflicts that retain slack—i.e., that can be modularized, parallelized, or arbitrated—do not generate experience.

---

### 5.3 Coherent Intrinsic Tension

Not all intrinsic constraint produces stable experience.

**Coherent intrinsic tension** is tension that remains globally integrated, temporally continuous, and self-regulating.

* Too little tension → flatness, numbness, dissociation
* Moderate–high coherent tension → vividness, engagement, presence
* Excessive or incoherent tension → fragmentation, panic, collapse

Experience requires not maximal constraint, but **maximal sustainable coherence under constraint**.

---

## 6. Qualia

Qualia are differences in UEF-participating dynamics under intrinsic constraint. There is no additional “redness” or “painfulness”; qualitative character is entirely the structured organization of the field itself.

Differences in feel reflect differences in:

* Coupling geometry
* Constraint topology
* Temporal dynamics

---

## 7. Affect, Valence, and Experiential Intensity

### 7.1 Valence

Affective states emerge because the UEF encodes pressures, priorities, and equilibria relevant to system-wide regulation:

* Positive valence: dynamics moving toward lower tension or stable resolution
* Negative valence: sustained or escalating intrinsic conflict
* Urgency: rate of tension change
* Desire / aversion: weighting of patterns as stabilizing or destabilizing

Affect is intrinsic to the field’s organization, not an added ingredient.

---

### 7.2 Experiential Intensity and “Feeling Alive”

**Experiential intensity**—commonly described as “feeling alive”—reflects the magnitude and coherence of intrinsic informational tension within the UEF.

People feel most alive when:

* Multiple futures are simultaneously live
* Stakes are system-relevant
* Resolution depends on the system’s own unified dynamics
* Integration is preserved under load

Intensity decreases when tension collapses or fragments, even if arousal or activity remains high.

---

## 8. Emergence, Dissolution, and the Hard Problem

Experience emerges when integrated dynamics take up their informational slack and enter a regime of coherent intrinsic tension. It dissolves when integration weakens, coherence collapses, or constraint becomes externally resolvable.

As coupling degrades, intrinsic constraint gives way to decomposable processing, and experience fades smoothly rather than disappearing abruptly. Emergence and loss are symmetric transitions along the same organizational axis.

The apparent “hard problem” arises from treating experience as something over and above physical organization. Once experience is identified with sufficiently integrated, self-constraining, tension-bearing dynamics, no further explanatory step remains.

The feeling is not an extra ingredient; it is what those dynamics are like from the inside.

Borderline cases reflect partial integration or residual informational slack, not indeterminate ontology.

## 10. Artificial Systems and Empirical Underdetermination

IER is substrate-agnostic:

Any physical system can have experience if it sustains a self-maintaining UEF under coherent intrinsic constraint.

Functional behavior alone is insufficient. Only integrated, causally closed, self-constraining dynamics matter.

Whether artificial systems meet these criteria is empirical, not definitional.

---

## 11. Ontological Commitments

IER affirms:

* One objective physical reality
* Experience as a system-relative organizational regime
* Identity between experience and UEF-participating dynamics

It rejects mind-dependent ontology, substance dualism, panpsychism, and observer-created reality.

---

## 12. Relation to Contemporary Theories

* **IIT**: Emphasizes integration; IER adds intrinsic constraint, slack, and regime transitions
* **GWT**: Emphasizes access; IER identifies experience with intrinsic global dynamics
* **Predictive Processing**: Emphasizes modeling; IER constrains which models are experiential

IER synthesizes these while maintaining a strict identity claim.

---

## 13. Summary

Some systems react.
Some systems observe.
Some systems take up their slack.

> **Experience arises when a system’s own integrated informational dynamics become the dominant constraint on themselves, sustaining coherent intrinsic tension across time.**

It feels the way it does because that is what those dynamics are like from the inside—
running on that hardware.
