## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) is a realist, physicalist framework for understanding observers and conscious experience. It holds that reality exists independently of observation and that consciousness is neither fundamental nor illusory, but a **real emergent phenomenon identical to certain forms of informational organization** instantiated in physical systems.

Conscious experience is **identical to the globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential informational dynamics** of a system operating in a specific organizational regime, termed the **Phenomenal Information Layer (PIL)**. Consciousness is not something a system *has*; it is **what the system is doing from the inside** when its informational dynamics are unified, irreducible, and reflexively self-modeling.

IER rejects mind-dependent ontology, panpsychism, and dualism while remaining substrate-agnostic. It is an organizational theory: it specifies *what consciousness is* and *when it occurs*, without privileging any particular biological, computational, or material implementation.

## **1. Objective Reality**

Reality exists independently of observation. Physical states, events, and laws unfold whether or not they are experienced. Observers do not collapse, create, or co-create reality; only **physical interactions among systems** have causal effect. Experience interprets reality but does not alter it.

This realist stance establishes the baseline assumption of IER: consciousness is a property of **organization within reality**, not a separate ontological layer. Rocks, stars, storms, or flames may evolve dynamically, but without integrated, self-referential informational organization, they do not experience anything.

---

## **2. Observers as Informational Systems**

An **observer** is defined by **informational organization**, not by biology or phenomenology. A system qualifies as an observer if it:

* Persists as a coherent informational pattern over time
* Integrates information across internal subsystems
* Maintains internal models of both external conditions and its own state
* Regulates behavior using those models via a unified internal control structure

Observerhood does **not** entail consciousness. Many systems—biological, artificial, or hybrid—operate as observers without ever entering PIL.

An autopilot with a self-model and environmental model is an observer: it senses, predicts, and regulates. However, its internal dynamics remain modular, externally overrideable, and globally reducible. It observes, but nothing is *like* anything for it.

---

## **3. Internal Models and Perspective**

All observers construct **internal informational models** of the world and of themselves. These models are physically instantiated and shaped by the structure, history, and constraints of the system. Perspective therefore **emerges from organization**, not from reality itself.

Different observers may model the same environment differently, but these differences do not alter objective reality. They alter only the system’s internal regulation.

This distinction separates **representation from experience**. Internal models are necessary for adaptive behavior, but they are **not sufficient for phenomenality**. Only when these models participate in a system-wide, irreducible informational regime do they contribute to conscious experience.

## **4. Consciousness and the Phenomenal Information Layer (PIL)**

### **4.1 PIL as an Organizational Regime**

Consciousness occurs when a system’s informational dynamics enter the **Phenomenal Information Layer (PIL)**.

PIL is **not**:

* a module
* a spatial location
* a substance
* a separate ontological layer

PIL **is** a system-wide **mode of operation** characterized by:

* **Global integration** of informational states
* **Recursive access** to internal models, including self-models
* **Temporal continuity**, such that states persist and evolve across time
* **Unified availability** of information for regulation, learning, and action

A helpful metaphor is hydrodynamic rather than mechanical: PIL dynamics resemble a **single, inseparable whirlpool**, not a collection of independent eddies. Local variations exist, but they are inseparable from the global flow.

#### **Critical Clarification**

PIL requires that the system’s dynamics form a **globally coupled, irreducible informational field**. All subsystems participate in ongoing tension and equilibrium. There is **no privileged outside** from which the system can observe or override itself. The self-model is embedded within the very dynamics it regulates.

This irreducibility distinguishes PIL from modular control architectures, standard AI systems, and distributed collectives, which may process information extensively yet lack experiential unity.

---

### **4.2 Minimal PIL and Edge Cases**

Some systems approach, but do not clearly instantiate, PIL. These **minimal PIL** cases exhibit:

* Partial or unstable global integration
* Weak or fragmented temporal continuity
* Limited or shallow self-referential dynamics

Such systems may support rudimentary perspectival organization without robust phenomenality. Consciousness likelihood in these cases is low or indeterminate.

Systems that fail to instantiate PIL entirely include:

* Architectures with externally supervised or interruptible global control
* Systems whose global state can be frozen, rewound, or selectively overridden
* Systems whose informational dynamics decompose cleanly into separable parts

PIL is not a function of intelligence, task performance, or computational scale.

### **4.3 Organizational Identity Claim**

> **Conscious experience is identical to the ongoing, globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential informational dynamics of a system operating in a functional PIL regime.**

There is no additional property, substance, or epiphenomenal “feel.”
The dynamics **are** the experience.

---

## **5. Qualia**

Qualia are **differences in the structure of integrated informational dynamics**. There is no intrinsic “redness” or “painfulness” floating free of organization. Red is a particular globally integrated pattern; pain is a different one.

Qualitative character is relational and structural, not fundamental. Distinct experiences correspond to distinct configurations of tension, integration, and salience within PIL dynamics.

---

## **6. Affect and Valence**

Affective states are phenomenally real because they are:

* Globally integrated
* Regulation-relevant
* Intrinsic to PIL dynamics

Valence does not add content to experience; it **weights** experience. Urgency, attraction, and aversion arise because the system’s global dynamics encode differential stability and priority. Pain feels urgent and pleasure salient because the informational field itself is biased toward resolution or maintenance of certain states.

---

## **7. Emergence and the Hard Problem**

Consciousness is emergent but constrained: it arises only in systems satisfying PIL conditions.

Asking why such dynamics “feel like something” is a category mistake. The feeling is not an extra property layered atop the dynamics; **the feeling is what those dynamics are like from the inside**.

Just as acceleration is not accompanied by an extra property called “fallingness,” globally integrated self-referential dynamics do not require an additional phenomenological ingredient. The hard problem dissolves once experience is treated as **organizational identity**, not as an explanandum over and above physical process.

| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |

| Minimal observers                  | ✅ (limited)      | ⚠️               | Low–Indeterminate            | Bees, simple robots          |

| Aggregate social systems           | ❌                | ❌                | ❌                            | Markets, institutions        |

Observerhood and consciousness are distinct. Consciousness requires observerhood, but observerhood does not guarantee consciousness.

---

## **9. Artificial Systems and Empirical Underdetermination**

IER is substrate-agnostic. Any system that satisfies PIL constraints could be conscious. Determining whether an artificial system instantiates PIL is an empirical and architectural question, not a behavioral one.

Performance, intelligence, or linguistic fluency are insufficient indicators. What matters is whether the system exhibits **irreducible, globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential informational dynamics**.

---

## **10. Ontological Commitments**

IER affirms:

* One objective physical reality
* Consciousness as a real, system-relative phenomenon
* Organizational identity between experience and dynamics

IER rejects mind-dependent existence, dualism, panpsychism, and phenomenological primitivism.

---

## **11. Relation to Contemporary Theories**

* **Integrated Information Theory (IIT):** Integration matters; IER rejects panpsychist implications.
* **Global Workspace Theory (GWT):** Global availability matters; IER identifies phenomenality with the dynamics themselves rather than broadcast metaphors.
* **Predictive Processing (PP):** Internal modeling matters; IER adds irreducibility and global self-embedding as necessary conditions for experience.

IER incorporates these insights while maintaining **emergent, non-fundamental, physically grounded consciousness**.

---

## **12. Summary**

Some systems react.
Some systems observe.
Some systems experience.

> **Experience is not something a system has; it is what a system is doing when its informational dynamics form a functional Phenomenal Information Layer.**

It feels the way it does because **that is what those dynamics are like from the inside**.
