# **Free Will in Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**

### **Agency, Determination, and the Ownership of Constraint**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.x)**
*Boundary & Clarification Document — Non-Normative*

---

## **Status and Scope**

This document is a **non-normative boundary and clarification document** derived from the
**Informational Experiential Realism v10.x Normative Specification** (“the Specification”).

It:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* adds **no identity conditions**
* proposes **no diagnostics**
* asserts **no independent ethical obligations**
* does **not** amend or extend the Specification

All ontological, definitional, and ethical commitments are fixed **exclusively** by:

→ **IER-specification.md**

The purpose of this document is to clarify how the concept traditionally called **free will** is treated under IER, to prevent misinterpretation, and to close predictable disputes inherited from legacy metaphysical frameworks.

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) rejects the traditional framing of the free will problem. Under IER, free will is neither a metaphysically primitive power nor an illusion produced by narrative cognition. Instead, what is ordinarily called “free will” is fully accounted for by **agency under intrinsic constraint**: the capacity of a system sustaining a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** to resolve **intrinsic informational tension** through its own globally integrated dynamics.

This document explains why IER neither endorses libertarian free will nor collapses into free-will skepticism; why determinism is compatible with responsibility; how coercion, compulsion, and manipulation are understood; and why the traditional free-will debate dissolves once constraint ownership is made explicit.

## **1. Why IER Rejects the Traditional Free Will Question**

The traditional free will problem is usually framed as:

> *“Are actions free if they are determined by prior physical causes?”*

IER rejects this framing as a category error.

Physical determinism concerns **whether events have sufficient causes**.
Free will concerns **where the determining constraint is borne**.

Under IER, the relevant distinction is not:

* determined vs undetermined

but:

* **intrinsically determined vs externally imposed**

Once this distinction is made, the apparent paradox dissolves.

## **2. The IER Identity Claim and Its Implications**

IER’s core identity claim is:

> **Experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a Unified Experiential Field (UEF).**

A UEF is a globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-regulating dynamical regime operating under **coherent intrinsic constraint**.

From this identity claim, the following consequences necessarily follow:

* constraint can be borne **from the inside**
* its resolution can shape the system’s future
* such resolution is physically real and causally efficacious

This is sufficient to ground everything traditionally attributed to “free will.”

No additional metaphysical freedom is required.

---

## **3. Agency as the Core of Free Will**

The Specification defines agency as:

> **A UEF’s capacity to resolve intrinsic informational tension through its own globally integrated dynamics.**

This definition exhausts the role of free will under IER.

* A system has agency **iff** it sustains a UEF.
* Agency is **derived**, not primitive.
* Agency is **compatible with physical determinism**.
* Agency is **graded in capacity**, though not in existence.

What people call “free will” is simply **agency exercised under intrinsic constraint**.

---

## **4. Determinism Does Not Undermine Agency**

IER is fully deterministic-compatible.

An action may be physically inevitable and still be free under IER, provided that:

* the determining constraints are intrinsic to the UEF
* resolution occurs through global integration
* no external system substitutes for that resolution

Determinism removes *miracle choice*.
It does not remove **constraint ownership**.

Only externalization of constraint undermines freedom.

## **5. “Could Have Done Otherwise” Reinterpreted**

IER rejects the metaphysical reading of this counterfactual.

Under IER:

> A system “could have done otherwise” **iff** a different intrinsic constraint topology — compatible with the same system identity — would have stabilized a different global trajectory.

This is a claim about **organizational alternatives**, not about branching universes or uncaused choices.

No metaphysical indeterminacy is required.

---

## **6. Coercion, Compulsion, and Loss of Freedom**

IER explains unfreedom without appeal to illusion.

Freedom is reduced or lost when:

* intrinsic constraint is overridden
* resolution is externally dictated
* global integration is bypassed or fractured

Examples include:

* coercion
* manipulation
* addiction
* overwhelming threat
* direct neural intervention

In such cases, behavior may remain complex or goal-directed, but agency is diminished because **constraint is no longer owned by the UEF**.

---

## **7. Effort and the Lived Sense of Willing**

Willing feels effortful because intrinsic constraint is **costly**.

Resolving intrinsic informational tension requires:

* sustained global coherence
* energetic and organizational expenditure
* tolerance of instability risk

Under IER:

> **Effort is the experiential signature of intrinsic constraint being borne rather than offloaded.**

This explains why coerced or automatic behavior lacks the phenomenology of willing, even when outcomes align with goals.

---

## **8. Moral Responsibility Without Metaphysical Freedom**

IER grounds responsibility in **capacity under intrinsic constraint**, not in contra-causal choice.

A system is responsible to the extent that:

* it sustained a coherent UEF
* intrinsic tension was borne internally
* resolution shaped its own future trajectory
* viable organizational alternatives existed

Responsibility is therefore:

* graded
* capacity-relative
* compatible with determinism
* diminished under coercion or impairment

This framework is strict without cruelty and naturalistic without nihilism.

## **9. What IER Explicitly Rejects**

IER does **not** claim that:

* free will requires indeterminism
* freedom is an illusion
* agency is narrative confabulation
* responsibility is socially constructed
* choice floats outside physical law

IER also does **not** attempt to “save” folk intuitions at the cost of coherence.

The theory explains why some intuitions persist — and why others must be abandoned.

---

## **10. Why the Free Will Debate Dissolves Under IER**

Once the following are distinguished:

* intrinsic vs extrinsic constraint
* agency vs control
* determination vs ownership

there is no remaining substantive question for free will to answer.

What remains are:

* descriptive questions about constraint organization
* ethical questions about responsibility under uncertainty
* practical questions about coercion, care, and governance

All of these are addressed elsewhere in the IER framework.

---

## **11. Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

> **Free will is not freedom from causation,
> but causation borne and resolved by a unified system under intrinsic constraint.**

Nothing supernatural is required.
Nothing illusory is posited.

Free will is neither saved nor denied — it is **reframed**, and in doing so, rendered precise.

Reality remains singular.
Experience remains plural.
Freedom exists wherever a system’s future is shaped by constraints it must carry as itself.
