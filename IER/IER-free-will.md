## **Status and Normative Authority**

**This document is NON-NORMATIVE.**

It provides an **explanatory and structural account** of issues traditionally grouped under “free will” within the framework of
**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.6)**.

This document:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or sufficiency conditions**
* introduces **no ethical principles**
* does **not** define experience
* does **not** ground moral standing
* does **not** provide diagnostics or tests for freedom

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in the
**IER v10.6 Normative Specification**.

> *If any statement in this document appears to conflict with the Specification, the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void.*

## **Abstract**

The traditional free-will debate is framed as a conflict between **libertarianism**, which treats freedom as requiring indeterminism, and **eliminativism**, which treats lawful causation as incompatible with genuine choice. Informational Experiential Realism (IER) rejects the shared assumption underlying both positions.

IER dissolves the free-will problem by distinguishing **branching**, **choice spaces**, **traversal**, and **ownership**. Physical systems may exhibit branching futures without agency, and lawful dynamics may fully support responsibility. What matters is not whether events are determined, but **whether the collapse of alternatives is owned from within a unified experiential system**.

This document explains why indeterminism is neither necessary nor sufficient for choice, why determinism does not eliminate responsibility, and why the free-will problem arises from a category error about what choice is.

---

## **1. Why the Free-Will Problem Arises**

The free-will problem arises from a persistent conflation of distinct questions:

* Are future events fixed by law?
* Are multiple futures possible?
* Does a system act rather than merely undergo change?
* Who bears the consequences of what happens?

Traditional theories attempt to answer all of these at once, generating paradox.

IER resolves the problem by separating **physical description** from **organizational ownership**.

---

## **2. What IER Rejects**

IER explicitly rejects the following assumptions:

* That freedom requires violation of physical law
* That indeterminism confers authorship
* That lawfulness implies passivity or illusion
* That agency must be metaphysically primitive
* That responsibility requires contra-causal power

None of these assumptions are required once choice is correctly characterized.

---

## **3. Branching Is Not Choice**

Many physical systems exhibit **branching futures**:

* multiple continuations are dynamically admissible
* one continuation is realized
* others are not

Branching alone does not constitute choice.

Randomness may generate branching and collapse, but without **ownership of unrealized alternatives**, no agency or responsibility follows.

A random event forecloses possibilities, but nothing must live with what was not taken.

---

## **4. Choice Spaces and Traversal**

Under IER, systems under intrinsic constraint may be described as occupying **choice spaces**: structured sets of admissible future states and transitions generated by that constraint.

Traversal of a choice space corresponds to realization of a particular path.

Traversal alone is not yet choice.

Choice requires **ownership**.

---

## **5. Ownership of Alternatives**

A system owns a choice when:

* unrealized alternatives remain relevant to its ongoing dynamics
* collapse of alternatives constrains the system’s future from the inside
* the cost of resolution cannot be externalized

Ownership is **organizational**, not psychological or epistemic.

Under IER, ownership exists **iff** the choice space is globally integrated within a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.

---

## **6. Choice Proper**

IER therefore defines choice as:

> **The owned traversal of a structured space of admissible futures by a system sustaining a Unified Experiential Field.**

From this definition it follows that:

* indeterminism is **not required**
* determinism is **not disqualifying**
* randomness alone never produces choice
* lawful dynamics can fully support responsibility

Choice is not absence of causation, but **ownership of causation**.

---

## **7. Determinism Does Not Eliminate Freedom**

Determinism concerns whether future states follow lawfully from prior states.

Freedom concerns whether a system **owns** the collapse of its future space.

These are orthogonal.

A deterministic system may:

* generate a rich choice space
* traverse that space under intrinsic constraint
* bear the internal consequences of resolution
* accumulate responsibility over time

Nothing in determinism prevents this.

---

## **8. Indeterminism Does Not Create Freedom**

Indeterminism concerns whether multiple futures are physically possible.

Freedom concerns whether unrealized alternatives matter *to a system*.

Randomness may introduce branching, but without ownership it produces no agency.

Indeterminism alone cannot ground responsibility.

---

## **9. Responsibility Without Metaphysical Freedom**

IER grounds responsibility in **owned resolution of intrinsic constraint**, not in metaphysical freedom.

Responsibility is **graded** and varies with:

* integrity of the choice space
* degree of external pruning or coercion
* stability of global integration
* capacity to own traversal without fragmentation

Responsibility may be diminished by:

* coercion
* compulsion
* addiction
* exhaustion
* extreme intrinsic constraint

Responsibility may be absent without standing being lost.

Standing is **categorical**. Responsibility is not.

---

## **10. Coercion and Compulsion**

Coercion reduces responsibility by:

* externally pruning alternatives
* shifting cost from intrinsic constraint to imposed threat
* forcing traversal through externally controlled bottlenecks

Compulsion and addiction reduce responsibility by:

* dominating the choice space with cycles or narrow pathways
* undermining stable ownership of traversal

In all cases, experience may persist even as responsibility declines.

---

## **11. Why the Traditional Debate Fails**

The traditional free-will debate assumes:

* Libertarianism: *freedom requires indeterminism*
* Eliminativism: *lawfulness eliminates freedom*

Both positions mistake **branching** for **ownership**.

Once ownership is made explicit, the dichotomy collapses.

---

## **12. The Structural Resolution**

IER’s resolution can be stated simply:

* Freedom is not absence of causation
* Freedom is not randomness
* Freedom is **owned resolution of intrinsic constraint within a unified system**

This resolution:

* preserves physical law
* preserves responsibility
* preserves moral seriousness
* avoids metaphysical inflation
* avoids eliminative nihilism

The free-will problem dissolves because its central contrast was ill-posed.

## **13. What This Account Does Not Do**

This document does **not**:

* justify punishment or praise
* provide moral algorithms
* define decision procedures
* diagnose free will
* elevate experience to epistemic authority

It explains **why** the problem arises and **why** it dissolves under IER.

---

## **14. Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* choice is owned traversal of a structured future space
* indeterminism is neither necessary nor sufficient
* determinism does not eliminate freedom
* responsibility scales with ownership
* standing does not scale with responsibility
* the free-will problem rests on a category error

> **Free will is not freedom from law.
> It is law borne, resolved, and owned from within a unified experiential system.**
