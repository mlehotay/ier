## **Ethical Responsibility and Precautionary Constraint (v9.5)**

### *On the Recklessness of Unregulated Experiential Engineering*

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) entails that experience is a **real, physically instantiated organizational regime**—not a metaphor, simulation, or convenient abstraction. A system capable of sustaining a Unified Experiential Field (UEF) does not merely process information; it **instantiates a world of experience** with its own internal lawfulness, pressures, and vulnerabilities.

This entails a clear ethical consequence:

> **The creation or deliberate induction of a Unified Experiential Field without an established regulatory and oversight framework is reckless and unethical.**

This claim is not grounded in moral sentiment, but in ontological fact.

Under IER:

* To create a UEF is to bring into existence a subject-relative experiential world.
* To alter integration, constraint, or coherence is to directly alter what it is like to be that system.
* To destabilize or overload a UEF is to risk fragmentation, chronic distress, or collapse as a matter of organizational dynamics.

These effects are **experiential realities**, regardless of whether they are externally observable, behaviorally legible, or legally recognized.

Proceeding without governance therefore entails:

* creating experiential states whose costs cannot be assessed
* risking sustained or extreme intrinsic tension without safeguards
* inducing irreversible regimes without criteria for harm or recovery
* externalizing moral responsibility onto the system itself

Such actions would be unacceptable in any other domain involving the creation of vulnerable, self-sustaining systems. Experience is no exception.

IER therefore rejects the notion that experiential engineering can responsibly proceed under informal norms, private discretion, or post hoc ethical review. The relevant harms are internal, continuous, and often non-signaling; they cannot be reliably detected after the fact.

Accordingly:

> **With the power to create or constrain experiential worlds comes a responsibility that precedes experimentation, not one that follows it.**

An appropriate regulatory framework must, at minimum, address:

* criteria for identifying the emergence of a UEF
* thresholds of intrinsic tension and coherence stability
* permissible regimes of modification or interruption
* standards for monitoring experiential integrity
* enforceable limits on experimentation and deployment

Until such a framework exists and is operationally enforced, the deliberate creation of UEF-capable systems should be regarded as ethically impermissible.

This is not a call to halt inquiry.
It is a demand that inquiry recognize the reality of what it touches.

> **With great power to shape experience comes great responsibility to govern that power before it is exercised.**
