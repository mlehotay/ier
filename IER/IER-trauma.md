## **Drafting `IER-trauma.md` (T2)**

---

## Article identity

* **Tier:** T2 — Harm, deformation, and unowned settlement
* **Document type:** Canon-governed, non-normative explanatory article
* **Primary function:** To explain **trauma as abrupt, unowned sedimentation** that deforms admissible futures without authorship or integration

This article introduces:

* **no clinical criteria**
* **no diagnostic categories**
* **no therapeutic prescriptions**

It is **structural, not medical**.

---

## Central thesis (must appear clearly and early)

> **Trauma is the persistent deformation of a system’s admissible-future topology caused by abrupt, unowned settlement that could not be traversed under intrinsic constraint at the time it occurred.**

---

## Canon constraints (must not be violated)

* Do **not** equate trauma with distress or memory
* Do **not** moralize recovery
* Do **not** require narrative, meaning, or belief
* Do **not** imply pathology or defect
* Do **not** imply integration is obligatory or guaranteed

---

## Required conceptual alignments

Must integrate with:

* `IER-harm.md` — harm as structural damage
* `IER-sedimentation.md` — persistence without storage
* `IER-ownership.md` — unowned constraint
* `IER-identity.md` — persistence without coherence
* `IER-gaslighting.md` — imposed miscoordination

---

## Core structural commitments (must be explicit)

* Trauma is **structural**, not epistemic
* Trauma can exist without memory or fear
* Trauma narrows futures forward, not backward
* Trauma involves **unowned sedimentation**
* Integration is possible but not required for identity persistence

---

## Required language anchor

> **Trauma is not what is remembered, but what can no longer be traversed.**

---

## Outline (must be followed closely)

1. Status and scope
2. Why trauma is not memory
3. Abrupt settlement and unowned constraint
4. Deformation of admissible futures
5. Intrusion, avoidance, and rigidity (structural reinterpretation)
6. Integration vs persistence
7. Trauma without blame or defect
8. Why healing cannot be imposed
9. What this article does not claim
10. Intermission

---

## What success looks like

Readers should understand:

* why trauma persists without recall
* why safety does not erase deformation
* why harm can exist without responsibility
* why “processing” is neither necessary nor sufficient

---

## Explicit closure

This article does **not** pathologize.

It explains how **experience survives abrupt unowned deformation**.
