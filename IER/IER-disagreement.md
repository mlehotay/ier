## *Why Some Disagreements Persist Without Error, Bad Faith, or Epistemic Failure*

---

## 0. Status, Scope, and Explicit Non-Claims

**Status**
This document is **explanatory and non-normative**. It introduces no new ontological, epistemic, or ethical commitments.

**Scope**
It operates entirely within the commitments already fixed by the IER Specification, including experiential identity, experiential pluralism, and epistemic non-authority.

**This document does NOT**:

* resolve disagreements
* rank perspectives
* claim that “both sides are right”
* treat disagreement as moral failure
* treat agreement as a goal or norm

**Purpose**
To explain why some disagreements persist **even when**:

* all parties are sincere
* all parties are informed
* no one is confused about the facts
* no one is reasoning incorrectly
* no one is acting in bad faith

---

## 1. The Standard Misframing of Disagreement

Most everyday and philosophical accounts of disagreement rely on a default error model. When two people disagree, it is typically assumed that at least one of the following must be true:

* someone lacks relevant information
* someone is reasoning incorrectly
* someone is biased or motivated
* someone is acting dishonestly
* convergence would occur under ideal conditions

These assumptions are often correct. Many disagreements dissolve under clarification, education, or improved reasoning.

But not all do.

A persistent remainder exists: disagreements that survive explanation, shared evidence, and explicit good faith. These cases are frequently treated as irrational, pathological, or morally suspect. Under IER, this diagnosis is often structurally mistaken.

## 2. Disagreement as Constraint Organization

### 2.1 What Actually Binds a System

Under Informational Experiential Realism, what feels *non-negotiable* to a system is not primarily:

* belief content
* stated reasons
* articulated values

What binds is **intrinsic constraint**: which variables determine admissible futures, responsibility boundaries, and stability under load.

A disagreement persists when different Unified Experiential Fields bind **different variables** as intrinsic constraint. When this occurs, the disagreement is not evidential or inferential. It is organizational.

### 2.2 Salience Is Not Epistemic Authority

IER strictly separates experiential force from epistemic authority.

* Experiential salience does **not** track truth.
* Experiential urgency does **not** track correctness.
* Experiential inevitability does **not** obligate others.

This separation is not a weakness of experience. It is a structural consequence of experiential identity.

Disagreement persists when experiential force is mistaken—by one or both parties—for epistemic privilege.

## 3. A Small Disagreement: Raisins

### 3.1 The Case

Some people enjoy raisins.
Others find them actively aversive.

The disagreement has several notable features:

* the stimulus is identical
* the facts are uncontroversial
* explanation does not resolve the disagreement
* no one expects convergence

Statements such as “they’re sweet,” “they’re chewy,” or “they’re natural” do not persuade someone who finds raisins unpleasant. Conversely, describing the aversion does not make the enjoyment disappear.

---

### 3.2 Structural Analysis

For one experiential system, raisins contribute to experiential coherence.
For another, the same stimulus introduces disruption.

Nothing is missing. Nothing is misperceived. Nothing is corrected by argument.

The disagreement is:

* categorical from the inside
* non-moral
* non-epistemic
* experientially real

---

### 3.3 What the Small Case Shows

The raisins case establishes a minimal but crucial point:

> Disagreement can persist without error.

Explanation may increase understanding, but it does not realign constraint organization. Calling this “just taste” is not dismissive; it is structurally accurate.

This benign case removes the assumption that persistence implies defect.

---

## 4. Why the Small Case Matters

The raisins example does not matter because of food. It matters because it isolates **pure constraint divergence** without moral pressure.

It shows that:

* sincerity does not guarantee convergence
* information does not guarantee alignment
* disagreement can be lawful

This prepares the ground for understanding why similar persistence appears in high-stakes moral and political cases—without collapsing into relativism or cynicism.

## 5. A Large Disagreement: Capital Punishment

### 5.1 The Persistence Problem

Disagreements over capital punishment often persist despite:

* shared awareness of wrongful convictions
* shared crime statistics
* shared international comparisons
* shared moral seriousness

Participants frequently report that they understand the opposing arguments—and remain unmoved. The disagreement feels categorical, not negotiable.

---

### 5.2 Competing Constraint Bindings

In simplified form, two dominant experiential regimes often appear.

**One regime binds intrinsic constraint to**:

* irreversibility
* moral contamination
* illegitimacy of state-inflicted death

From within this regime, execution is categorically unacceptable, regardless of procedural safeguards.

**Another regime binds intrinsic constraint to**:

* proportionality
* closure
* legitimacy of final sanction

From within this regime, refusing capital punishment can feel like a failure of moral accounting.

These bindings operate prior to argument. They determine which futures are admissible and which are foreclosed.

---

### 5.3 Why Argument Does Not Resolve the Disagreement

Additional facts often fail to resolve the dispute because facts are not the binding variable.

The disagreement is not about:

* whether mistakes occur
* whether deterrence is perfect
* whether the state is fallible

It is about **which variable defines unacceptable cost**.

Both sides experience their position as necessary, not optional. This necessity is experiential, not epistemic.

---

## 6. Why This Is Not Relativism

### 6.1 One Reality, Many Constraint Organizations

IER affirms:

* one objective physical reality
* many internally lawful experiential worlds

Persistent disagreement does not imply multiple truths. It implies non-shared constraint organization.

Truth remains mind-independent. Experience does not arbitrate it.

---

### 6.2 Rehabilitating “Just Perspective”

Under IER, saying “it’s just perspective” does **not** mean:

* arbitrary preference
* equal correctness
* indifference to stakes

It means:

> The disagreement arises from distinct, internally coherent organizations of intrinsic constraint that do not share binding variables.

This is a structural claim, not a dismissal.

---

## 7. Disagreement and Conflict

### 7.1 Disagreement Without Harm

Disagreement alone does not imply:

* coercion
* domination
* moral violation

Multiple constraint organizations can coexist without interference.

---

### 7.2 When Disagreement Becomes Morally Relevant

Conflict arises when:

* one regime imposes irreversible constraint on another
* futures are foreclosed without shared binding

This document does not adjudicate such cases. It marks only the structural distinction.

---

## 8. What IER Refuses to Promise

IER does **not** promise:

* convergence through reason
* persuasion through sincerity
* resolution through explanation
* neutral arbitration by experience

These refusals follow directly from experiential identity and epistemic non-authority.

---

## 9. Summary

* Some disagreements persist without error or bad faith
* Explanation can clarify without resolving
* Experiential salience confers no epistemic authority
* Perspective is structural, not arbitrary
* Disagreement can be the lawful coexistence of incompatible constraint organizations

### **Intermission — Orientation Signal**

> **Not all disagreements are misunderstandings.
> Some are the stable coexistence of incompatible ways of binding the future.**
