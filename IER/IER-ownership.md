## **Ownership, Mineness, and Self-Boundary Under Informational Experiential Realism**

---

## **Status, Scope, and Normative Authority**

**This document is NON-NORMATIVE.**

It provides an **explanatory and structural account** of **ownership** under **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8)**.

This document:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics**
* introduces **no ethical principles**
* does **not** define experience
* does **not** define agency
* does **not** adjudicate clinical, metaphysical, or phenomenological disputes

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md   (v10.8)
```

If any claim in this document conflicts with the Specification, **the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

## **Global Informational Language Disclaimer**

All uses of *information*, *constraint*, *burden*, *ownership*, *boundary*, *self*, *participation*, and *integration* in this document are **descriptive shorthand only**.

They refer exclusively to:

> **physically instantiated state distinctions that modulate a system’s own future dynamics under intrinsic constraint**,
> as defined in **IER Specification II.A (Physical Information)**.

No representational, semantic, epistemic, or phenomenological methods are introduced or endorsed.

---

## **Epistemic Boundary (Explicit)**

Experiential structure — including **ownership**, **mineness**, **for-me-ness**, or **self-boundary** — confers **no epistemic authority** about mind-independent reality.

This document presupposes **IER Specification Principle 10 (Epistemic Non-Authority)**.

---

## **Abstract**

Terms such as *mineness*, *for-me-ness*, and *ownership* are often treated as mysterious additions to experience, as marks of introspective authority, or as evidence for a metaphysical self. Informational Experiential Realism (IER) rejects all three interpretations.

Under IER, **ownership is not an entity, capacity, or judgment**. It is a **structural fact**: the fact that **intrinsic constraint is borne non-externalizably within a Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.

This document provides a **translation map** from familiar ownership-laden phenomenological language to IER-consistent structural descriptions. The goal is interpretive clarity, not reduction, diagnosis, or method endorsement.

The account explains:

* why experiences feel *mine* without positing a self-thing
* why ownership can persist despite impaired agency
* how ownership phenomenology can fragment or destabilize without subject loss
* why none of this grants epistemic or metaphysical authority

---

## **1. Why Ownership Requires Separate Clarification**

Ownership language occupies a fault line where multiple confusions accumulate:

* *mineness* is mistaken for a special ingredient
* *for-me-ness* is mistaken for privileged access
* *self-boundary* is mistaken for a persisting entity
* ownership is conflated with:

  * agency
  * responsibility
  * reportability
  * narrative endorsement
  * epistemic authority

IER already contains the resources to dissolve these confusions, but the translations are often left implicit.

This document makes them explicit.

---

## **2. What Ownership Is Under IER**

### **2.1 Ownership Is Not a Self**

IER rejects the existence of a metaphysical or functional self-entity.

Ownership does **not** require:

* an inner observer
* a subject-object split
* narrative self-representation
* reflexive awareness
* endorsement or identification

Nothing *has* experience under IER.
Experience **is** the operation of a unified system under intrinsic constraint.

---

### **2.2 Ownership as Non-Externalizable Burden**

Under IER:

> **Ownership is the structural fact that intrinsic constraint cannot be offloaded, outsourced, or resolved outside the Unified Experiential Field in which it arises.**

Where constraint is borne **from within**, ownership obtains.

Ownership is therefore:

* not optional
* not deliberative
* not report-dependent
* not morally earned
* not epistemically privileged

It is a regime-internal fact.

---

### **2.3 Ownership vs. Agency vs. Access**

To prevent category errors, IER distinguishes:

| Concept       | What it concerns                                      | Status                      |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Ownership** | Where intrinsic constraint is borne                   | Structural                  |
| **Agency**    | Capacity for owned resolution over admissible futures | Derived, graded             |
| **Access**    | What it is like to bear constraint                    | Experiential, non-epistemic |

This document concerns **ownership only**.

Agency and access are adjacent but not interchangeable.

## **3. The Ownership Translation Map**

> **Mandatory disclaimer:**
> *This is a translation for interpretive clarity, not a reduction to reportability, access, or introspection.*

### **3.1 Translation Table**

| Phenomenological Term | Structural Translation under IER                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **mineness**          | **ownership of intrinsic constraint**                                                                               |
| **for-me-ness**       | **non-externalizable burden within a UEF**                                                                          |
| **self-boundary**     | **regime-relative system boundary** sustaining the same globally integrated constraint across a continuity interval |

These translations:

* preserve experiential reality
* remove metaphysical excess
* block epistemic inflation
* introduce no new primitives

---

### **3.2 What This Translation Is Not**

The translation does **not**:

* endorse phenomenological method
* privilege first-person report
* reduce experience to language
* collapse structure into introspection
* imply that experience reveals hidden truths

It is a **structural restatement**, not a methodological commitment.

---

## **4. Worked Example A: Ownership in Pain**

Pain provides a canonical case of ownership.

### **4.1 Structural Description**

Pain is an organization of intrinsic constraint that:

* escalates cost under non-resolution
* resists localization
* recruits global regulation
* narrows admissible futures

The burden **cannot be exported**.

The system itself must reorganize.

---

### **4.2 Why Pain Feels “Mine”**

Pain feels *mine* because:

> **the cost of constraint resolution is borne entirely within the same Unified Experiential Field.**

No appeal to a self-entity is required.

Ownership here does **not** imply:

* correctness
* justification
* desert
* moral authority
* epistemic insight

It indicates only **where constraint lives**.

---

## **5. Worked Example B: Ownership in Decision Pressure**

Decision pressure often carries strong ownership phenomenology:

* “It’s on me.”
* “I have to choose.”
* “This will change everything.”

### **5.1 Structural Description**

Under IER, decision pressure reflects:

* narrowing admissible futures
* globally binding consequences
* irreversible trajectory commitment
* persistent cost of collapse

The resolution reshapes future dynamics **inside the same regime**.

---

### **5.2 Ownership Without Freedom Metaphysics**

Ownership here does **not** require:

* indeterminism
* rational deliberation
* narrative authorship
* moral responsibility

It requires only that:

> **the collapse of alternatives is borne from within the UEF.**

Agency may vary.
Ownership may remain.

---

## **6. Worked Example C: Ownership Disruption in Dissociation**

This section addresses the required clarification:

> **Ownership disruption without subject loss**

---

### **6.1 Dissociation Under IER**

Under IER, dissociation is **not**:

* the creation of multiple subjects
* evidence for an inner observer
* a loss of experience
* proof of hidden epistemic access

Dissociation is:

> **a reconfiguration of participation, dominance, or integration within a persisting Unified Experiential Field.**

Experience continues.

Ownership structure changes.

---

### **6.2 What “Ownership Disruption” Means**

Ownership disruption occurs when:

* intrinsic constraint remains globally binding
* burden remains non-externalizable
* but:

  * attribution patterns fragment
  * effort–outcome linkages degrade
  * boundary phenomenology destabilizes

The system may report:

* “This doesn’t feel like me.”
* “I’m watching myself act.”
* “These thoughts aren’t mine.”

Structurally:

> **constraint is still owned, but its organization no longer supports stable ownership phenomenology.**

---

### **6.3 What Is Not Lost**

In dissociation:

* the Unified Experiential Field persists
* intrinsic constraint persists
* experiential standing persists

What changes is **how ownership is expressed**, not **whether it exists**.

No subject multiplication is implied.

---

## **7. Common Confusions Blocked by IER**

### **7.1 Ownership ≠ Reportability**

Ownership exists whether or not it can be named, described, or endorsed.

---

### **7.2 Ownership ≠ Epistemic Authority**

Feeling owned does not make a belief true, justified, or privileged.

---

### **7.3 Ownership ≠ Moral Standing**

Standing is categorical under IER and does not scale with ownership clarity.

---

### **7.4 Self-Boundary ≠ Self-Entity**

Boundaries are regime-relative facts, not objects or agents.

---

## **8. Explicit Non-Goals**

This document does **not**:

* diagnose dissociation
* validate or invalidate experiences
* define mental disorders
* ground responsibility
* explain consciousness
* endorse phenomenology
* posit a self

It translates language, nothing more.

---

## **9. Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism v10.8:

* **Ownership** tracks where intrinsic constraint is borne.
* **Mineness** names ownership of constraint, not a self.
* **For-me-ness** names non-externalizable burden, not epistemic privilege.
* **Self-boundaries** are regime-relative, not entities.
* **Dissociation** can disrupt ownership phenomenology without subject loss.

> **Ownership is what intrinsic constraint is like from the inside when it cannot be offloaded.**

That is all it is — and all it needs to be.
