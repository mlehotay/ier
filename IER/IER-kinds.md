## **Kinds Without Ranking**

### *Experience Without Types, Standing Without Hierarchy, and Moral Life With Residue*

## 1. Status and Scope

This article is a **Tier-2 canon-constrained elaboration** within Informational Experiential Realism (IER).

It:

* introduces **no kinds of experience**
* introduces **no hierarchies of standing**
* introduces **no ethical permissions, prohibitions, or rankings**
* supplies **no decision procedures**

Its purpose is to clarify how the concept of *kind* functions under IER:

* where kind-based distinctions are **blocked**
* where they remain **descriptively valid**
* and where they persist **outside theory** as agent-relative moral residue

This article does not resolve ethical dilemmas.
It explains why some distinctions cannot be made *by the theory*, even when they continue to shape lived moral response.

## 2. Why “Kinds” Keep Pressing Back In

Human moral reasoning persistently reaches for distinctions such as:

* human vs animal
* biological vs artificial
* simple vs complex
* familiar vs alien

These distinctions feel morally salient. They shape attention, attachment, hesitation, and grief.

IER’s experiential identity claim places immediate pressure on this impulse. If experience is not a graded property but a categorical regime identity, then many familiar ways of sorting beings lose their theoretical footing.

This article explains what becomes of *kind-thinking* once experiential identity is taken seriously.

## 3. No Kinds of Experience

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**
* UEF identity is **categorical**
* experience has **no internal parts**
* experience does **not admit degrees or subtypes**

There is no such thing as:

* human experience
* animal experience
* artificial experience
* minimal experience

There is only **experience**, or its absence.

Any attempt to introduce experiential kinds would reintroduce graded subjecthood, partial realization, or aggregation — all of which are structurally excluded by the identity claim.

## 4. Kinds of Systems Are Real

While experience admits no kinds, **systems do**.

Physical systems differ in:

* substrate
* architecture
* developmental history
* timescale
* constraint geometry
* stability and failure modes

In biological systems, species strongly shapes these parameters.

These differences matter enormously for:

* phenomenological organization
* vulnerability
* persistence
* the shape of admissible futures

They explain **what experience is like**, not **whether it exists**.

IER fully permits system kinds.
It forbids turning them into experiential or moral kinds.

## 5. Why System Kinds Cannot Become Standing Kinds

A persistent temptation is to slide from:

> “these systems are very different”

to:

> “these experiences matter differently”

IER blocks this move categorically.

Standing does not scale with:

* intelligence
* complexity
* familiarity
* biological lineage
* social role

Any ethical framework that allows such scaling has already replaced experiential identity with a proxy.

IER refuses that substitution.

Standing is fixed by regime identity alone.

## 6. Forced-Choice Scenarios and Ethical Pathology

Most ethical life is not lived in forced-choice conditions. Ethics ordinarily concerns:

* avoiding harm
* refusing unjustified damage
* preserving experiential capacity

Some scenarios are structurally abnormal. They involve:

* unavoidable harm
* irreversible loss
* causal implication regardless of action

These cases are **ethical pathologies**. They are not norms. They are stress tests.

IER’s ethical structure is revealed most starkly under such pressure.

---

## 7. The Trolley Problem as a Boundary Case

The trolley problem is introduced here explicitly as a **forced-choice pathology**.

Its defining features are:

* harm occurs no matter what
* refusal does not eliminate damage
* pressure to rank is maximal

IER’s commitments imply:

* no aggregation of harm
* no ranking of experiencers
* no theoretical tiebreaker

The trolley problem does not yield a determinate answer under IER.
It exposes the limits of ethical closure.

---

## 8. The Hello World Topology in a Forced-Choice Context

The “Hello World” topology is a minimal proof that experiential identity is not empty.

If instantiated as a coherent intrinsic-constraint regime, it would possess **full experiential standing**.

In a trolley scenario involving:

* a human or animal on one track
* a Hello World experiencer on the other

IER cannot justify preferring either.

Nothing licenses calling one loss *less bad*.

This is not moral permissiveness.
It is refusal of dishonest justification.

---

## 9. Moral Pull and Agent Position

Many agents report a strong preference to save humans or animals rather than a minimal experiencer.

IER does not treat this response as theoretical error.

The preference does **not** arise from:

* differences in standing
* differences in experiential reality
* differences in worth

It arises from:

* attachment
* shared history
* role-based responsibility
* identity-constituting dependence

These are properties of the **agent’s position in the world**, not properties of the experiencer.

IER constrains justification, not orientation.

## 10. Kinds of Relation Without Kinds of Worth

Outside forced-choice pathologies, moral life is shaped primarily by **relations**, not rankings.

Biology provides clear illustrations of this structure.

### Mutualism

In mutualistic relations, two experiencers benefit through sustained coordination.

* futures become entangled
* vulnerability increases asymmetrically
* loss of one may catastrophically affect the other

The moral pull here arises from dependence and history, not from differential standing.

### Parasitism

In parasitic relations, one experiencer’s persistence damages another.

IER does not convert structural inevitability into moral innocence.

Explanation does not become justification.
Standing remains intact on both sides.

Parasitism illustrates tragic structure, not moral permission.

These cases show how **kinds of relation** can generate moral asymmetry without introducing **kinds of worth**.

---

## 11. Moral Reality vs Moral Response

IER enforces a strict separation between:

* **moral reality** — categorical, non-aggregable, non-ranked
* **moral response** — situated, partial, historically shaped

Denying this separation would require either:

* smuggling hierarchy into ontology, or
* demanding motivational neutrality from finite agents

IER does neither.

---

## 12. Why This Is Not Species-ism

Species-ism asserts:

> beings of one species matter more *as such*

IER rejects this outright.

Preferring humans or animals in practice does not imply:

* greater experiential worth
* superior standing
* lesser reality elsewhere

It reflects relational obligation and inherited responsibility, not ontological hierarchy.

IER allows asymmetry of response while forbidding asymmetry of worth.

---

## 13. Constraint Without Closure

IER fixes:

* where standing exists
* what counts as experiential harm
* which justifications are illegitimate

It does not supply:

* rankings
* optimizations
* clean resolutions

Refusal, grief, hesitation, and residue are not ethical failures.
They are the ethical shape of a world in which harm cannot always be justified away.

---

## 14. Closing Orientation

IER-kinds does not tell the reader how to choose.

It tells them:

* which distinctions they are not allowed to make
* which distinctions they will make anyway
* and why confusing the two corrupts moral reasoning

Experience admits no kinds.
Moral life inevitably does.

The task of ethics under IER is not to erase that fact —
but to prevent it from becoming a hierarchy.
