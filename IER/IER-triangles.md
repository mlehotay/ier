# **Dream Triangles and the Question of Instantiation**

*A sympathetic IER engagement with a recurring intuition*

## **1. Why the Triangle Question Matters**

The question

> *“If you dream of a triangle, where does the triangle exist?”*

has an unusual staying power. It returns again and again in discussions of consciousness, not because it is technically complex, but because it targets something deeply intuitive: the apparent mismatch between **what experience is like** and **what physical description seems to offer**.

A particularly clear and careful articulation of this puzzle appears in an essay published by the **Essentia Foundation**, associated with the work of **Bernardo Kastrup**. The essay argues that when one dreams of a triangle, the experience seems to involve genuine geometric structure, yet no corresponding structure appears to be physically instantiated in the brain. From this, the essay draws pressure against standard physicalist accounts of mind.

This article is written in the spirit of engagement rather than refutation. Informational Experiential Realism (IER) takes the triangle intuition seriously, agrees with much of what motivates it, and understands it as pointing to a real explanatory gap. Where IER diverges is not in diagnosing *that* something is missing, but in how that absence should be interpreted.

## **2. A Shared Starting Point: Rejecting Inner Pictures**

One of the most valuable contributions of the dream triangle argument is its clear rejection of a naïve picture theory of experience.

The Essentia essay rightly emphasizes that:

* there is no literal triangle-shaped object in the brain,
* neural correlates of dreaming are not geometrically isomorphic to dream content,
* and nothing like an internal “screen” is found by neuroscience.

IER fully agrees. Any account of experience that relies, even implicitly, on inner pictures, displays, or renderings is already misframed. Experience does not consist in internal images that mirror external shapes.

On this point, there is no disagreement.

## **3. Where the Pressure Builds**

The real force of the dream triangle argument comes from the following tension:

1. The dream triangle appears experientially concrete and structurally determinate.
2. No physical structure instantiates those geometric properties as a triangle.
3. Therefore, experience seems to outrun physical instantiation.

This tension is genuine. It reflects a widespread sense that *whatever experience is*, it does not seem to be captured by familiar notions of physical structure, even when those notions are made abstract or computational.

IER takes this pressure seriously and agrees that something important has been exposed. The question is how to respond to it without immediately moving to a non-physical ontology.

## **4. A Gentle Shift in Framing: From Objects to Regimes**

IER’s response begins with a small but consequential reframing.

The dream triangle argument implicitly treats the triangle as something that must either:

* exist as a physical object or structure, or
* exist in some non-physical way.

IER suggests a third option:

> **The dream triangle is not an object that exists somewhere at all.**

Under Informational Experiential Realism, experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** — a globally integrated, temporally continuous regime under intrinsic, unavoidable constraint. Within such a regime, qualitative structure arises not by instantiation of inner objects, but by **organization of constraint**.

From this perspective, the triangle is not something *represented* or *located*. It is a way the system is organized from the inside during a particular experiential regime.

## **5. Reconsidering the Screen Analogy**

The Essentia essay makes productive use of an analogy with computer graphics: code does not contain triangles; only rendered output on a screen does. Dreams, it is argued, lack any such rendering surface.

IER agrees that this analogy is instructive — but interprets its lesson differently.

A screen is:

* an output interface,
* designed for external observation,
* whose function is display.

Experience, under IER, is not an output at all. It is not something produced *for* an observer, internal or external. As a result, the absence of a “screen” is not a problem to be solved, but a sign that the display metaphor itself has reached its limit.

The triangle is not waiting to be rendered. Nothing is missing.

## **6. Isomorphism Without Dismissal**

Another point of convergence deserves emphasis. The Essentia argument shows convincingly that **geometric or pictorial isomorphism is not required for experience**. IER agrees, and extends this point slightly further.

Under IER:

* organizational similarity,
* functional equivalence,
* computational mirroring,
* or behavioral resemblance

do not by themselves determine experiential status.

This is not a rejection of structure, but a clarification of *which* structure matters. What matters is not resemblance, but **intrinsic ownership of globally binding constraint**. Two systems may be extraordinarily similar in every externally describable respect, yet differ categorically in whether experience is present.

This claim is not meant to trivialize similarity, but to acknowledge how demanding experiential identity actually is.

## **7. What the Dream Triangle Becomes Under IER**

Seen through this lens, the dream triangle is neither puzzling nor diminished.

It is:

* experientially real,
* qualitatively structured,
* stable enough to support recognition and description,

without being an instantiated geometric object anywhere.

The question “where does the triangle exist?” quietly assumes that experience must consist of located things. IER suggests that this assumption, rather than physicalism itself, is what the thought experiment ultimately invites us to reconsider.

## **8. A Difference in Ontological Direction, Not in Sensitivity**

It is worth emphasizing what this response does *not* do.

It does not deny the reality, richness, or importance of experience.
It does not suggest that physical description “explains away” phenomenology.
It does not dismiss the dream triangle intuition as confused or naïve.

Instead, it treats the intuition as pointing toward a real inadequacy in representational and instantiation-based models of mind — a point on which IER and the Essentia tradition are closely aligned, even where their ontological conclusions differ.

---

## **9. Closing Reflections**

The dream triangle remains a powerful way of destabilizing overly simple pictures of mind–brain identity. Its enduring appeal suggests that something important is being touched, even when conclusions diverge.

Informational Experiential Realism proposes that what the argument ultimately reveals is not the non-physicality of experience, but the need to think of experience as **regime identity rather than object instantiation**.

On that reading, the triangle does not disappear — it simply stops needing a place to be.
