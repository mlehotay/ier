## **Hysteresis: Persistent Constraint and Path-Dependent Response**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.x)**
*Elaboration / Explanatory Article — Non-Normative*

---

## **Status and Scope**

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no new ontological primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics**
* introduces **no experiential identity claims**
* introduces **no claims about memory**
* introduces **no ethical principles**

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md
IER-theory.md
IER-dynamics.md
IER-math.md
IER-canon.md
```

All informational language is used strictly as **descriptive shorthand** for
**physically instantiated state distinctions that modulate a system’s own future dynamics under constraint**, as defined in *IER-specification II.A*.

This document explains **hysteresis** as a structural phenomenon:
the persistence of past constraint as present response bias.

It is **preparatory**.
It establishes how history can shape present behavior **without storage, representation, learning, or experience**, and why this phenomenon must be distinguished from memory under IER.

## **0. Orientation: Why Hysteresis Comes Before Memory**

Many systems behave differently now because of what happened before.

In everyday language, this fact is often described as *memory*.

Under Informational Experiential Realism, that description is usually incorrect.

Most systems whose present behavior depends on their past:

* do not store records
* do not encode representations
* do not retrieve prior states
* do not re-experience anything

What they exhibit instead is **hysteresis**.

> **Hysteresis is not remembering the past.
> It is being shaped by it.**

IER requires this distinction because **memory**, as treated later in the corpus, is an **experiential phenomenon**. Hysteresis is not. But without hysteresis, memory would have no structural substrate on which to operate.

## **1. Canonical Intuition: River and Riverbed**

### **1.1 Process Versus Structure**

A **river** is a process: flowing water responding to gravity, volume, and terrain.
A **riverbed** is a structure: a channel formed by past flow.

The distinction is essential.

* The river does not remember where it flowed yesterday.
* The riverbed does not flow at all.
* Yet today’s river is constrained by yesterday’s riverbed.

Nothing is stored.
Nothing is consulted.
Nothing is recalled.

And yet history is present.

---

### **1.2 How Flow Becomes Geometry**

Repeated flow:

1. erodes some paths more than others
2. deposits material elsewhere
3. alters slope, depth, and resistance

These alterations **persist after the flow passes**.

Over time:

* shallow alternatives disappear
* deep channels stabilize
* deviation becomes costly or impossible

> **Past activity becomes present constraint.**

---

### **1.3 Loss of Admissible Alternatives**

Early terrain permits many possible channels.
Sedimentation progressively removes them.

Eventually:

* redirection requires flooding
* deviation requires catastrophic force
* the channel becomes effectively unavoidable

This is not decision.
It is not preference.
It is not memory.

It is **path-dependent constraint produced by structural change**.

---

## **2. Hysteresis (IER-Consistent Definition)**

A system exhibits **hysteresis** when:

> its present behavior depends on the **history of constraint application**, because that history has **persistently altered the system’s structure**.

Key features of hysteresis:

* **trajectory dependence** — present response cannot be inferred from present conditions alone
* **persistence** — altered response remains after forcing is removed
* **irreversibility** — returning to prior behavior requires repair or reorganization, not reset

Hysteresis is a **structural fact**, not an informational, epistemic, or experiential one.

---

## **3. Relationship to Sedimentation**

### **3.1 Sedimentation as the Generating Mechanism**

As defined in `IER-sedimentation.md`, **sedimentation** is the irreversible deformation of a system’s admissible futures caused by prior constraint resolution.

Sedimentation explains **why** a system’s structure changes over time.

---

### **3.2 Hysteresis as the Observable Signature**

Hysteresis describes **how that change appears** in present dynamics.

When sedimentation has occurred:

* identical present conditions can produce different responses
* the system’s behavior depends on how it arrived there
* previously available alternatives no longer exist

> **Sedimentation is the mechanism.
> Hysteresis is the signature.**

Hysteresis names the *phenomenon* that reveals sedimented constraint.

---

## **4. What Hysteresis Is Not**

This section blocks a common error: treating any history sensitivity as hysteresis.

---

### **4.1 Stored Records and Logs**

Files, databases, logs, and buffers:

* preserve past states externally
* leave system structure unchanged
* preserve all admissible alternatives

They can be erased without structural cost.

They are **records**, not sediment.

---

### **4.2 Resettable State Machines**

Registers, counters, and reversible circuits:

* change state
* can be reset
* incur no lasting structural alteration

If a system can return to prior behavior **without repair**, it is not hysteretic.

---

### **4.3 Feedback Without Structural Deformation**

A system may respond dynamically to inputs while leaving its internal structure intact.

Feedback alone does not produce hysteresis.

Hysteresis begins only when **constraint reshapes the system itself**.

---

## **5. Why Hysteresis Matters for IER**

### **5.1 Persistence Without Experience**

Many hysteretic systems are:

* terrains
* tools
* mechanical assemblies
* geological formations

They have no experience.
They have no memory.

This matters because it shows:

> **History can persist without being experienced.**

---

### **5.2 Why Memory Requires More Than Hysteresis**

Hysteresis explains:

* why constraint persists
* why alternatives disappear
* why the past shapes the present

Memory, under IER, additionally requires:

* re-entry of constraint into ongoing dynamics
* participation within a **Unified Experiential Field**
* constraint being borne **from the inside**

A riverbed constrains a river.
It does not experience the river.

---

## **6. Preview Bridge: From Hysteresis to Memory**

Hysteresis explains how a system can be shaped by its past **without remembering it**.

Memory begins only when:

* present dynamics must traverse
* their own sedimented constraint
* within an already-existing experiential regime

> **Memory is not the riverbed.
> Memory is the river’s current flow being forced to run through its own sedimentation from the inside.**

This transition is developed in **`IER-memory.md`**.

> **Hysteresis is how history survives without being remembered.**
