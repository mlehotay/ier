## 1. First: Reframe the corpus around v10.0

Treat **IER v10.0** as the **axiomatic core**, not just the latest version.

Everything else should answer *one* of these questions:

1. **Clarification** – does this explain a concept introduced in v10?
2. **Application** – does this apply v10 to a domain (ethics, DID, AI, biology)?
3. **Formalization** – does this rigorously express v10 (math / dynamics)?
4. **Diagnostics** – does this give a test or criterion derived from v10?

If a companion does **none** of these cleanly, it should be merged, deprecated, or archived.

## 2. Recommended consolidation outcome (high-level)

### A. Keep as independent companions (but update language)

These still earn their own documents:

1. **IER-theory.md (v10.0)**
   → *Foundational / canonical*

2. **IER-math.md**
   → Rename to something like
   **“Formal Constraints and Curvature in IER”**
   Update framing from “v9.4 companion” → “formalization of v10”

3. **IER-ethics.md**
   → Strong, distinct contribution
   Just needs terminology alignment (Unified Experiential Field, intrinsic constraint dominance)

---

### B. Merge into a single **“Dynamics & Diagnostics”** paper

These three overlap heavily in *mechanism* and *criteria*:

* IER-mechanics.md
* IER-pause-and-resume-test.md
* Parts of IER-DID.md (mechanism sections only)

**Proposed merged paper:**

> **IER Dynamics: Intrinsic Constraint, Regime Stability, and Failure Modes**

Sections:

* Informational slack & intrinsic tension
* Regime formation and collapse
* Pause–resume as a special case diagnostic
* Dissociation as constrained regime switching (DID as applied case)

This removes redundancy while strengthening coherence.

---

### C. Merge into a **Pluralism & Meaning** paper

These are philosophically aligned and partially redundant:

* IER-pluralism.md
* IER-storytelling.md

**Proposed merged paper:**

> **Experiential Pluralism and Meaningful Attractors**

Core themes:

* Many experiential worlds, one physical reality
* Attractors under intrinsic constraint
* Narrative, instinct, and cultural persistence as organizational solutions

This becomes your *“IER explains meaning without mysticism”* paper.

---

## 3. What is likely out of date or no longer necessary

### Likely deprecated as standalone

* **IER-pause-and-resume-test.md**
  → Still valuable, but better as a *section*, not a paper

* **IER-mechanics.md (as-is)**
  → Content survives, structure doesn’t

### Needs revision, not removal

* **IER-DID.md**
  The conclusion is still excellent, but:

  * It relies on v9.4 framing
  * It should be explicitly positioned as *non-foundational*
  * Best folded into a general regime-failure framework

## 4. How to use ChatGPT Projects with the 5-file limit

### Phase 1 — Core Alignment Pass

Upload:

1. IER-theory.md
2. IER-math.md
3. IER-ethics.md
4. IER-mechanics.md
5. IER-pause-and-resume-test.md

**Goal:**
Ask ChatGPT to:

* Extract **all core concepts**
* Identify **terminology drift**
* Propose a unified v10 vocabulary

---

### Phase 2 — Application & Meaning Pass

Upload:

1. IER-theory.md
2. IER-DID.md
3. IER-pluralism.md
4. IER-storytelling.md
5. (Optionally) revised dynamics draft from Phase 1

**Goal:**

* Identify redundancies
* Propose merged outlines
* Flag claims that now belong in the core vs applications

---

### Phase 3 — Final Consolidation

Upload:

* Revised v10 core
* Draft merged companions

**Goal:**

* Tighten narrative
* Ensure no circular definitions
* Ensure every companion *derives from*, not competes with, the core

---

## 5. A useful litmus test for every surviving paper

If you want a sharp criterion:

> **If this paper disappeared, would IER v10 lose explanatory power — or only pedagogical richness?**

* If **explanatory power** → keep or elevate
* If **pedagogical richness** → merge or shorten
* If **neither** → archive
