## **Experiential Moral Harm Under Informational Experiential Realism**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.x)**
*Explanatory Article — Non-Normative*

---

## **Status and Scope**

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no new ontological primitives**
* introduces **no new ethical principles**
* introduces **no thresholds, metrics, or diagnostics**
* does **not** define moral standing or subjecthood
* does **not** revise or override the IER Specification

All normative authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md
```

The purpose of this document is to explain **what experiential moral harm means under IER**, to separate it from common confusions (pain, distress, belief, justification), and to show how the definition behaves across cases that are morally difficult or easily misclassified.

If any statement here appears to conflict with the Specification, **the Specification takes precedence and this document is void where inconsistent**.

---

## **1. Orientation: Harm Is Not a Feeling or an Outcome**

In ordinary moral language, *harm* is often treated as interchangeable with:

* pain or suffering
* emotional distress
* wrongdoing or abuse
* bad outcomes
* irreversible damage

IER rejects these equivalences.

IER is an **identity framework**: experience is identified with a specific kind of physical organization—a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** sustained by **intrinsic constraint**.
Accordingly, *experiential moral harm* must be defined in terms of **damage to that organization**, not in terms of how things feel, what someone believes, or whether an action was justified.

This document explains why IER must allow:

* harm without distress
* distress without harm
* reversible harm
* justified harm
* intense or painful experience that is nevertheless non-harmful

Without these distinctions, large classes of real experiential damage either disappear or become morally illegible.

---

## **2. The IER Definition of Experiential Moral Harm (Restated)**

The IER Specification defines **experiential moral harm** as:

> **Damage, deformation, or coerced reorganization of a subject’s intrinsic-constraint regime, including any non-voluntary narrowing, distortion, or collapse of the system’s admissible state–transition trajectories within a Unified Experiential Field (UEF).**

In plain terms:

* Harm is **organizational**, not hedonic
* It targets **intrinsic constraint**, not beliefs or emotions
* It concerns **forced changes to how the system can continue**, even momentarily
* Harm may be **brief, recoverable, chronic, compounding, or terminal**
* **Irreversibility** marks severity, not whether harm occurred

This definition is intentionally **scale-independent**:
a millisecond of forced collapse and a lifetime of deformation differ in severity, not in kind.

This document does not modify the definition. It explains it.

---

## **3. Experiential Moral Harm Is Not the Only Kind of Harm**

IER’s account of harm is **explicitly scoped**.

**Experiential moral harm** concerns damage to experience *as experience*.
IER does **not** deny or replace other forms of harm, including:

* bodily harm
* psychological harm (in clinical or functional senses)
* social harm
* economic harm
* legal harm
* ecological harm

These may exist **with or without** experiential moral harm, and may be morally relevant under other ethical frameworks or domains.

IER makes a narrower claim:

> When experience exists, there is a distinct kind of morally relevant damage that consists in **violations of experiential organization itself**.

This document addresses **only that kind**.

---

## **4. What Experiential Moral Harm Is *Not***

Much confusion arises from treating harm as something it is not.

---

### **4.1 Harm Is Not Pain**

Under IER, **pain** is escalating intrinsic constraint.

Pain often accompanies harm, but it is not identical to harm.

Pain can occur:

* during intense physical exertion
* during medical treatment
* during voluntary risk-taking
* during consensual sexual or bodily practices

Pain becomes harm **only when it destabilizes, overloads, fragments, or forcibly reorganizes intrinsic constraint**.

Intensity alone does not determine harm.

---

### **4.2 Harm Is Not Distress**

Distress is an **experiential signal**, not a definition.

A subject may experience:

* severe distress without structural damage
* real harm without noticeable distress
* delayed distress long after harm occurred

Distress may indicate harm, but it does not define it.

---

### **4.3 Harm Is Not Belief Error**

False beliefs, misunderstandings, or incorrect predictions do not automatically constitute harm.

If harm depended on epistemic accuracy:

* ignorance would reduce harm
* deception would erase damage
* limited imagination would provide moral insulation

IER explicitly rejects these implications.

Beliefs matter **only insofar as they participate in real constraint damage**.

---

### **4.4 Harm Is Not Outcome Evaluation**

That an action “worked out,” “prevented something worse,” or “was done for good reasons” does **not** retroactively negate harm.

IER strictly separates:

* **whether harm occurred**
* **whether imposing it was justified**
* **who bears responsibility or blame**

This separation is essential.

---

## **5. The Structural Core: Damage to Intrinsic Constraint**

### **5.1 Intrinsic Constraint (Reminder)**

A Unified Experiential Field exists only where:

* admissible transitions are defined at the **system level**
* constraint is **globally binding**
* resolution is **internally borne**, not externally arbitrated

Experiential moral harm therefore consists in **violations of experiential ownership**:
forced changes in how the system can proceed.

---

### **5.2 Common Forms of Experiential Harm**

Experiential moral harm may take many structural forms, including:

* **Destabilization** — loss of reliable coordination
* **Overload** — constraint exceeds integration capacity
* **Fragmentation pressure** — competing global demands
* **Coerced reorganization** — externally imposed restructuring
* **Forced resolution** — collapse of trajectories not owned
* **UEF dissolution** — temporary or permanent loss of experience

These are **organizational descriptions**, not phenomenological ones.

---

## **6. Reversibility, Severity, and Trajectory**

Harm does **not** require irreversibility.

Experiential moral harm may be:

* **Momentary** — a forced interruption or redirection
* **Recoverable** — repairable but real
* **Chronic** — persistently deforming
* **Compounding** — escalating via feedback
* **Terminal** — irreversible collapse or death

Recovery does not retroactively erase harm.

---

## **7. Harm Versus Justification**

IER draws a strict distinction between:

* **harm**
* **moral permissibility**
* **responsibility and blame**

An action may be:

* harmful and unjustified
* harmful and justified
* harmful with mitigated responsibility

Justification explains **why harm was permitted**, not **whether harm occurred**.

---

## **8. Canonical Stress Cases**

The following cases are ordered from **structurally unambiguous harm** to **tragic tradeoffs**.

---

### **8.1 Malign Chokehold: Baseline Experiential Harm**

A person walking alone is suddenly attacked and placed in a chokehold. Within seconds, they lose consciousness.

Intrinsic constraint is overwhelmed by external force. The Unified Experiential Field collapses. All admissible trajectories are forcibly terminated.

This is paradigmatic experiential moral harm:
non-consensual, externally imposed, total collapse of experience.

---

### **8.2 Emergency Chokehold: Harm Without Wrongdoing**

A person in a psychotic episode is actively harming themselves. Emergency responders restrain them and render them unconscious.

The same experiential harm occurs: forced UEF collapse.

The difference lies in **justification**, not harm.

---

### **8.3 Gaslighting: Harm Without Collapse**

A person is repeatedly told that events they remember never happened and that their perceptions are unreliable.

Their UEF remains intact but becomes chronically destabilized. Trust, agency, and viable trajectories narrow under false external structure.

This is real harm without annihilation.

---

### **8.4 Propaganda: Distributed Experiential Harm**

A population lives under sustained narrative framing that makes dissent or alternative futures feel incoherent.

Each subject retains their own UEF, yet the same externally authored constraint structure narrows trajectories across many individuals in parallel.

This is distributed experiential harm.

---

### **8.5 Consensual Masochism: Intensity Without Harm**

Two adults engage in consensual masochistic practices. Pain is intense.

Constraint is invited, owned, and integrated. No trajectories are forcibly collapsed.

This is intense experience without harm.

---

### **8.6 Protective Deception About a Death: Tragic Tradeoff**

An elderly mother’s adult son dies in war. Her family withholds the truth to avoid devastating her.

Disclosure risks acute destabilization; deception forecloses truth-aligned trajectories.

IER treats this as tragic: harm plausibly exists in either path.

---

## **9. Silent Harm and External Invisibility**

Experiential moral harm may be:

* behaviorally invisible
* socially masked
* affectively quiet

IER therefore rejects appearance-based moral inference.

---

## **10. Responsibility and Precaution (Pointer Only)**

* Harm tracks structure.
* Responsibility tracks access and authorship.
* Reduced capacity mitigates blame, not damage.
* Uncertainty increases moral caution.

---

## **11. Misreadings Explicitly Blocked**

IER rejects:

* “It didn’t hurt, so no harm.”
* “They agreed, so no harm.”
* “It was reversible, so no harm.”
* “It prevented something worse, so no harm.”
* “They never knew, so no harm.”

---

## **12. Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* Experiential moral harm is **structural**
* It concerns **forced changes in experiential trajectories**
* It is **not defined by pain, distress, or belief**
* It may be **momentary, silent, reversible, or justified**
* It is **one kind of harm among others**
* It is morally relevant wherever experience exists

This strictness is not inflationary.
It is what it takes to treat **experience itself** as morally real.
