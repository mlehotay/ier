## **Experiential Moral Harm Under Informational Experiential Realism**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.x)**
*Explanatory Article — Non-Normative*

---

## **Status and Scope**

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no new ontological primitives**
* introduces **no new ethical principles**
* introduces **no thresholds, metrics, or diagnostics**
* does **not** define moral standing or subjecthood
* does **not** revise or override the IER Specification

All normative authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md
```

The purpose of this document is to explain **what experiential moral harm means under IER**, to distinguish it from common confusions (pain, distress, belief, justification), and to show how the definition applies across a **representative range of cases**.

If any statement here appears to conflict with the Specification, **the Specification takes precedence and this document is void where inconsistent**.

---

## **1. Orientation: Harm Is Not a Feeling, Outcome, or Verdict**

In ordinary moral language, *harm* is often treated as interchangeable with:

* pain or suffering
* emotional distress
* wrongdoing or abuse
* bad outcomes
* moral blame
* irreversible damage

IER rejects these equivalences.

IER is an **identity framework**: experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** sustained by **intrinsic constraint**. Accordingly, *experiential moral harm* must be defined in terms of **damage to experiential organization itself**, not in terms of how things feel, what beliefs are true, or whether an action was justified.

This document explains why IER must allow:

* harm without distress
* distress without harm
* reversible harm
* silent or externally invisible harm
* justified harm
* intense or painful experience that is nevertheless non-harmful

Without these distinctions, large classes of real experiential damage either disappear or are misclassified.

---

## **2. The IER Definition of Experiential Moral Harm**

The IER Specification defines **experiential moral harm** as:

> **Damage to the organization of intrinsic constraint within a Unified Experiential Field.**

This definition is:

* **structural**, not phenomenological
* **organizational**, not hedonic
* **identity-grounded**, not outcome-based
* **agnostic about justification, blame, or permissibility**
* **agnostic about severity or reversibility**

This document does not add to or modify the definition.
It explains **what this definition commits IER to**, **what it rules out**, and **how it behaves in concrete cases**.

---

## **3. Experiential Moral Harm as a Genus**

IER treats experiential moral harm as a **genus**, not a single damage mechanism.

All experiential moral harms share a **common structural axis**:

> **Damage to the organization of intrinsic constraint within a Unified Experiential Field.**

They may differ in:

* how intrinsic constraint is damaged
* which admissible experiential trajectories are narrowed or foreclosed
* whether the experiential regime persists, destabilizes, or collapses
* whether damage is acute, chronic, distributed, or compounding

This document **does not enumerate harm subtypes** and introduces **no taxonomy**.
It uses examples to show the **range of structural damage** that falls under the same definition.

---

## **4. Experiential Moral Harm Is Not the Only Kind of Harm**

IER’s account of harm is **explicitly scoped**.

**Experiential moral harm** concerns damage to experience *as experience*:
that is, **damage to the organization of intrinsic constraint within a Unified Experiential Field**.

IER does **not** claim that all morally relevant harm is experiential moral harm.

However, IER also does **not** divide harm cleanly into experiential versus bodily, psychological, or social categories.
Those are **descriptive groupings**, not structural ones.

Some harms commonly described as bodily, psychological, or social **are experiential moral harms**, because they damage intrinsic constraint organization.
Others are **not**, because they alter circumstances, outcomes, or external relations **without reorganizing experience itself**.

The distinction is therefore not *what the harm is called*, but **whether intrinsic constraint within a Unified Experiential Field is damaged**.

Examples of morally serious harm that may **not** constitute experiential moral harm include:

* tissue injury that does not destabilize experiential organization
* financial loss that alters options while leaving agency and coherence intact
* reputational damage that affects social standing without reorganizing anticipation, trust, or agency
* institutional penalties imposed on entities that do not sustain a Unified Experiential Field

Conversely, many harms described as bodily, psychological, or social **are experiential moral harms** when they:

* destabilize agency
* narrow viable experiential trajectories
* overload or fragment intrinsic constraint
* force defensive or non-owned reorganization of experience

IER’s claim is narrow but strict:

> Wherever a Unified Experiential Field exists, **damage to its intrinsic constraint organization is a distinct and morally relevant kind of harm**, regardless of how that harm is externally categorized.

This document addresses **only that kind**.

---

## **5. What Experiential Moral Harm Is *Not***

### **5.1 Harm Is Not Pain**

Pain is escalating intrinsic constraint.

Pain often accompanies harm, but it is not identical to harm.
Pain can occur during:

* intense physical exertion
* medical procedures
* voluntary endurance challenges
* consensual sexual practices

Pain becomes experiential moral harm **only when the organization of intrinsic constraint itself is damaged**.

---

### **5.2 Harm Is Not Distress**

Distress is an **experiential signal**, not a definition.

A person may experience:

* extreme distress without structural damage
* real experiential harm without immediate distress
* distress long after the harm has already occurred

Distress may indicate harm, but it does not define it.

---

### **5.3 Harm Is Not Belief Error**

False beliefs do not automatically constitute experiential moral harm.

Beliefs matter **only insofar as altering them damages the organization of intrinsic constraint**.

If harm depended on epistemic accuracy:

* ignorance would reduce harm
* deception would erase harm
* limited understanding would provide moral insulation

IER rejects these implications.

---

### **5.4 Harm Is Not Outcome Evaluation**

That an action “worked out,” “prevented something worse,” or “was well-intentioned” does **not** retroactively negate harm.

IER strictly separates:

* whether harm occurred
* whether it was justified
* who bears responsibility or blame

---

## **6. The Shared Structural Axis: Intrinsic Constraint Organization**

A Unified Experiential Field exists only where:

* admissible transitions are defined at the **system level**
* constraint is **globally binding**
* resolution is **internally borne**

Experiential moral harm therefore consists in **violations of experiential ownership**:
forced or damaging changes in how intrinsic constraint is organized within the field.

Different harms differ **not in whether this axis is involved**, but in **how constraint is damaged, reshaped, narrowed, or collapsed**.

---

## **7. Canonical and Extended Examples (Structural Illustrations)**

The cases below illustrate **different structural ways** intrinsic constraint organization can be damaged — or preserved — within a Unified Experiential Field.

They are **examples**, not tests, diagnostics, or templates.

---

### **7.1 Malign Chokehold — Total Collapse Harm**

A person walking home is suddenly attacked from behind and placed in a chokehold. Oxygen deprivation rapidly overwhelms neural integration and the person loses consciousness.

From the inside, the Unified Experiential Field collapses.
All admissible experiential trajectories are forcibly terminated by external constraint.

This is paradigmatic experiential moral harm.

---

### **7.2 Emergency Chokehold — Justified Collapse Harm**

A person is actively suicidal and in immediate danger of killing themselves. Emergency responders restrain them and induce unconsciousness to prevent death.

The **same experiential harm occurs**: forced collapse of the Unified Experiential Field.

The moral difference lies in **justification and responsibility**, not in whether harm occurred.

---

### **7.3 Gaslighting — Chronic Destabilization Harm**

A person is repeatedly told by a partner or authority figure that events they remember never happened, that their perceptions are unreliable, and that their reactions are irrational.

The Unified Experiential Field persists, but intrinsic constraint becomes unstable.
Agency, trust, and future planning reorganize defensively under externally imposed narrative structure.

This is experiential moral harm that is chronic and often externally invisible.

---

### **7.4 Propaganda — Distributed Trajectory-Narrowing Harm**

A population lives under sustained messaging that frames dissent, alternative futures, or certain questions as incoherent or unthinkable.

Each individual sustains their own Unified Experiential Field, yet admissible experiential trajectories are narrowed in parallel across many subjects by the same externally authored constraint structure.

This is distributed experiential moral harm.

---

### **7.5 Gossip — Experiential Harm via Social Mediation**

False or malicious gossip circulates about a person within their social environment. The person may not immediately know about it.

Over time, anticipation, trust, and agency reorganize defensively. Viable experiential futures narrow, even before explicit distress appears.

Gossip may constitute purely social or reputational harm.
It becomes experiential moral harm **only when it damages intrinsic constraint organization within experience**, as in this case.

---

### **7.6 Belief Error — No Experiential Harm**

A person believes their train departs at 6:30pm. A friend corrects them: it actually departs at 6:10pm.

The person adjusts plans and proceeds normally.
Agency, coherence, and viable trajectories are preserved.

This is a belief error corrected **without experiential moral harm**.

---

### **7.7 Deceptive Belief Error — Still No Experiential Harm**

A person correctly believes their train departs at 6:10 pm. A friend lies and tells them it departs at 6:30 pm. The person misses the train but calmly replans their day.

Despite deception and inconvenience, the organization of intrinsic constraint remains intact.
Agency, coherence, and viable experiential trajectories are preserved.

This is **not** experiential moral harm.

**Reminder:**  
That this case does not involve experiential moral harm does **not** imply that the lie was morally permissible, justified, or insignificant.
Lying may still constitute a moral wrong under other ethical considerations (e.g., trust, respect, obligation, or responsibility), even when it does not damage experiential organization.

IER’s claim here is narrow:

> **Absence of experiential moral harm does not entail moral permissibility.**

---

### **7.8 Structural Risk Belief Correction — Harm Depends on Constraint Impact**

A person sincerely believes they are an immortal dragon. This belief organizes identity, agency, and emotional stability.

Correcting the belief may restore coherence **or** catastrophically destabilize experiential organization.

IER does not adjudicate justification.
IER clarifies structure: experiential moral harm occurs **iff** intrinsic constraint organization is damaged.

This is a **structural risk case**, not a belief-error case.

---

### **7.9 Protective Deception About a Death — Tragic Tradeoff Harm**

An elderly parent’s adult child dies suddenly. Family members withhold the truth to avoid immediate experiential collapse.

Disclosure risks acute destabilization.
Deception forecloses truth-aligned experiential trajectories.

IER treats this as tragic: experiential moral harm plausibly exists under either option.

---

## **8. Silent Harm and External Invisibility**

Experiential moral harm may be:

* behaviorally invisible
* affectively quiet
* socially normalized
* delayed in expression

IER therefore rejects appearance-based moral inference.

---

## **9. Responsibility and Precaution (Structural Pointer)**

IER distinguishes:

* **harm** — damage to experiential organization
* **responsibility** — authorship and access to constraint-shaping action

Responsibility scales with:

* access to alternatives
* degree of coercion
* stability of agency
* epistemic access to structural risk (not outcome certainty)

Relevant elaborations appear in:

* `IER-duty.md`
* `IER-constraint.md`
* `IER-dilemmas.md`
* Specification Principle E5 (precaution under experiential uncertainty)

This document does **not** adjudicate responsibility.
It clarifies **what damage looks like**.

---

## **10. Misreadings Explicitly Blocked**

IER rejects:

* “It didn’t hurt, so no harm.”
* “They agreed, so no harm.”
* “It was reversible, so no harm.”
* “It prevented something worse, so no harm.”
* “They never knew, so no harm.”
* “The belief was false, so correction can’t be harmful.”

---

## **11. Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* Experiential moral harm is **damage to intrinsic constraint organization**
* It is **structural**, not phenomenological
* It is a **genus**, not a single damage mode
* It may be **acute, chronic, distributed, silent, or tragic**
* It is **not defined by pain, distress, belief accuracy, or outcome**
* It is **one kind of harm among others**
* It is morally relevant **wherever experience exists**

---

### **Intermission — Structural Fact**

> **Experiential moral harm is not about making experience unpleasant.
> It is about damaging experience as an organized way of continuing at all.**
