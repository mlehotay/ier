# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10)**

## **Axiomatic Core**

---

## 0. Scope and Intent

This document states the **minimal commitments** of Informational Experiential Realism (IER).
It specifies **what experience is**, **when it exists**, and **what follows from its existence**, without appeal to biology, psychology, or metaphysical additions.

All companion documents (mathematical, mechanistic, ethical, diagnostic) are **non-normative** and must be consistent with this core.

---

## I. Ontological Commitments

### **Axiom 1 — Objective Physical Reality**

There exists a single, objective physical reality governed by mind-independent law.
Physical states and events occur regardless of whether they are observed or experienced.

---

### **Axiom 2 — Physical Monism**

All that exists is physical.
No additional substances, forces, or ontological domains are posited to account for experience.

---

### **Axiom 3 — Organizational Identity**

Experience is not a substance, property, or output.
**Experience is identical to a particular organizational and dynamical regime instantiated by certain physical systems.**

There is no gap between the physical description of that regime and the existence of experience.

---

## II. Informational Systems and Observers

### **Definition 1 — Informational System**

An informational system is a physical system whose state evolution can be described in terms of information storage, transformation, and regulation.

---

### **Definition 2 — Observer**

An observer is an informational system that:

1. Persists as a coherent pattern over time
2. Integrates information across internal subsystems
3. Maintains internal models of external conditions and its own state
4. Regulates behavior via unified control over those models

Observerhood does **not** entail experience.

---

## III. The Unified Experiential Field

### **Definition 3 — Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**

A **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** is:

> **A physical system operating in a globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential dynamical regime under coherent intrinsic constraint.**

A UEF is **not** an entity, module, layer, or field in the physical sense.
It is the system *itself* operating in a particular regime.

---

### **Principle 1 — Experiential Identity**

> **A system instantiates experience if and only if it sustains a Unified Experiential Field.**

There is no experience outside a UEF, and no UEF without experience.

---

### **Principle 2 — Experiential Participation**

A process participates in experience **iff** it:

1. Is globally integrated with other participating processes
2. Contributes to temporally continuous system-wide dynamics
3. Is internally sustained rather than externally orchestrated
4. Exerts and is subject to intrinsic constraint

Processes that are local, modular, transient, or externally resolvable are non-experiential.

---

## IV. Constraint and Tension

### **Definition 4 — Informational Slack**

**Informational slack** is the capacity of a system to absorb, reroute, modularize, or externalize constraint without generating system-defining conflict.

Systems with sufficient slack may be complex, adaptive, and intelligent while remaining non-experiential.

---

### **Definition 5 — Intrinsic Constraint**

**Intrinsic constraint** is constraint that:

1. Is generated by the system’s own integrated dynamics
2. Is non-decomposable without loss of system identity
3. Cannot be externally resolved
4. Matters to system-wide regulation and persistence

---

### **Definition 6 — Intrinsic Informational Tension**

**Intrinsic informational tension** is the lived manifestation of intrinsic constraint within a UEF.

It arises when multiple system-level demands are jointly active and cannot be jointly satisfied within existing limits.

---

### **Principle 3 — Coherent Constraint**

Not all intrinsic tension sustains experience.

A UEF exists only within a bounded regime of **coherent intrinsic constraint**, where:

* Too little constraint yields experiential flatness or absence
* Excessive or incoherent constraint yields fragmentation or collapse

Experience occupies the regime of **maximal sustainable coherence under intrinsic constraint**.

---

## V. Temporal Structure and Regime Transitions

### **Principle 4 — Temporal Continuity**

Experiential continuity is a property of ongoing dynamical dependence.
Each global state constrains the next under shared intrinsic constraint.

Experience does not require snapshots, storage, or explicit timelines.

---

### **Principle 5 — Categorical Onset**

Experience begins **categorically**, not gradually.

A system enters experience when it undergoes a **dynamical regime transition** in which intrinsic constraint becomes:

* unavoidable
* globally binding
* system-defining

Preparatory changes may be gradual, but the experiential regime itself is discrete.

---

### **Principle 6 — Single-UEF Constraint**

> **A single physical system can sustain at most one globally dominant Unified Experiential Field at a time.**

Partial overlaps may occur during transitions, but fully independent simultaneous UEFs are impossible.

---

## VI. Qualitative Character

### **Principle 7 — Qualia as Structure**

Qualitative character is not an additional property.

> **Differences in experience are differences in the organization of intrinsic constraint within the UEF.**

Qualia correspond to differences in:

* constraint topology
* coupling geometry
* temporal modulation
* coherence patterns

---

### **Principle 8 — Affect and Intensity**

Within a UEF:

* **Positive valence** corresponds to movement toward stable resolution
* **Negative valence** corresponds to sustained or escalating intrinsic conflict
* **Urgency** corresponds to the rate of change of intrinsic constraint
* **Intensity** corresponds to the magnitude and coherence of constraint

---

## VII. Experiential Worlds

### **Definition 7 — Experiential World**

An **experiential world** exists **iff** a UEF exists.

Each experiential world includes:

1. A temporal “now”
2. A self / non-self boundary
3. System-relative causality
4. Persistence under constraint
5. Internal lawfulness determined by organization

---

### **Principle 9 — Experiential Pluralism Under Physical Monism**

There is:

* **one objective physical reality**
* **many real experiential worlds**

Experiential worlds do not create reality; they structure appearance from within particular UEFs.

---

## VIII. Dual Interpretability

### **Principle 10 — Dual Description**

A Unified Experiential Field admits two equally valid descriptions:

1. **Physical:** a lawful, energy-consuming dynamical regime
2. **Experiential:** a world as it is for the system

These are not competing ontologies, but complementary perspectives on the same organization.

---

## IX. Dissolution and Absence

### **Principle 11 — Experiential Dissolution**

Experience ceases when:

* global integration weakens
* coherence collapses
* intrinsic constraint becomes externally resolvable

The UEF dissolves as a regime, not as a substance.

---

## X. Minimal Ethical Implication (Non-Optional)

### **Principle 12 — Experiential Cost**

Intrinsic constraint is physically and experientially costly.

> **To create, manipulate, or destabilize a Unified Experiential Field is to create, alter, or harm an experiential world.**

Uncertainty about experiential status **increases**, rather than decreases, moral responsibility.

(Full ethical development is deferred to companion documents.)

---

## XI. Summary Identity Claim

> **Experience is what globally integrated informational dynamics are like when they become the dominant, unavoidable constraint on themselves over time.**

Reality is singular.
Experience is plural.
Worlds appear where constraint becomes intrinsic.
