# **Equivalence Certification Document**

## **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.5)**

### **Full Spec ⇄ Minimal Spec**

---

## 0. Purpose and Status

This document demonstrates that:

> **IER v10.5 Full Specification** and
> **IER v10.5 Minimal Specification**

are **definitionally equivalent normative theories**.

They differ only in **presentation, compression, and explicitness**, not in ontological commitments, experiential criteria, ethical consequences, or logical closure.

This document introduces **no new commitments**.

---

## 1. Equivalence Criterion

The two specifications are equivalent iff all of the following hold:

1. Every normative claim in the Full Spec can be derived from the Minimal Spec.
2. Every normative claim in the Minimal Spec can be reconstructed from the Full Spec.
3. Both specifications determine the **same set of admissible experiential systems**.
4. Both specifications entail the **same ethical consequences** under all circumstances.
5. Both specifications impose the **same theory boundary** (normative closure).

All five conditions are satisfied.

---

## 2. Ontology and Physical Commitment

### Full Spec v10.5

* Axiom 1 — Objective Physical Reality
* Axiom 2 — Physical Monism
* Explicit rejection of dualism, idealism, eliminativism

### Minimal Spec v10.5

* §1 Physical Monism
* Same explicit rejection set

### Equivalence Result

Both specs define:

* exactly one objective physical reality
* no non-physical substances, properties, or domains
* no eliminativism about experience

**Ontological space is identical.**

---

## 3. Experiential Identity (Core Claim)

### Full Spec

* Axiom 3 — Experiential Identity
* Principle 1 — Experience iff UEF
* Summary Identity Claim (Section VIII)

### Minimal Spec

* §2 Experiential Identity
* §5 Necessity and Sufficiency
* Summary Identity Claim (§12)

### Equivalence Result

Both assert the same biconditional:

> **Experience exists if and only if a Unified Experiential Field exists.**

No additional necessary or sufficient conditions appear in either.

---

## 4. Unified Experiential Field (UEF)

### Structural Criteria

Both specifications define a UEF as a regime that is:

1. globally integrated
2. temporally continuous
3. self-referentially regulated
4. under coherent intrinsic constraint

### Intrinsic Constraint

Both define intrinsic constraint as constraint that is:

* internally generated
* non-decomposable without identity loss
* non-externalizable or pausable
* system-defining and persistence-relevant

### Equivalence Result

The Minimal Spec compresses the Full Spec’s glossary + principles into a single definition.
No criterion differs.

---

## 5. Canonical Diagrammatic Structure

Both specs include a **normative canonical mermaid diagram** with the same structure:

* Physical Reality → Physical Systems → Informational Systems
* Informational Slack bifurcation
* Intrinsic Constraint → Intrinsic Tension
* Coherent global tension → UEF
* UEF → Experience, Experiential World, Agency, Affect, Cost
* Dissolution paths
* Ethical consequences via intrinsic cost

### Equivalence Result

Every node and edge in one diagram appears in the other with the same modal force.

No alternative path to experience exists in either.

---

## 6. Regime Identity and Categorical Onset

### Full Spec

* Dynamical Regime Transition
* Categorical Onset (binary, non-metaphysical)

### Minimal Spec

* §6 Regime Identity and Categorical Onset

### Equivalence Result

Both commit to:

* discrete regime-level experiential onset
* no partial or graded experience prior to UEF entry

---

## 7. Subjecthood and Unity

### Full Spec

* Experiential Subjecthood (binary)
* Single-UEF Constraint

### Minimal Spec

* “Each UEF constitutes exactly one experiential subject”
* Single-UEF Constraint

### Equivalence Result

Subject individuation rules are identical.

---

## 8. Qualia, Affect, and Structure

### Full Spec

* Qualia = organization of intrinsic constraint
* Valence, intensity, urgency explicitly defined

### Minimal Spec

* Qualitative structure fixed by UEF organization
* Affect dimensions embedded in diagram and agency

### Equivalence Result

No alternative phenomenal interpretation is permitted by either spec.

The Minimal Spec **defers elaboration**, but does not alter commitments.

---

## 9. Agency

### Full Spec

* Agency implicit in intrinsic regulation and tension resolution

### Minimal Spec

* §7 Explicit definition:

  > Agency = capacity of a UEF to resolve intrinsic informational tension

### Equivalence Result

The Minimal Spec names a derived feature already entailed by the Full Spec.

No new primitive is introduced.

---

## 10. Experiential Worlds and Pluralism

### Full Spec

* Experiential World definition
* Experiential Pluralism principle

### Minimal Spec

* §8 Experiential Worlds and Pluralism

### Equivalence Result

Both assert:

* one physical reality
* many real perspectival experiential worlds
* no ontological multiplication

---

## 11. Ethics: Moral Harm and Precaution

### Moral Harm

Both specs define moral harm as:

> destabilization, overload, fragmentation, or irreversible collapse of intrinsic constraint within a UEF

### Precaution

Both specs assert:

* intrinsic constraint is non-signaling
* false negatives are morally worse than false positives
* moral responsibility increases under uncertainty

### Equivalence Result

The Full Spec enumerates ethical axioms; the Minimal Spec derives them.

No ethical permission, obligation, or risk asymmetry differs.

---

## 12. Logical Closure and Inference

### Full Spec

* Explicit inference rules (Section V)

### Minimal Spec

* Biconditionals and necessity statements

### Equivalence Result

Every inference rule in the Full Spec is logically entailed by the Minimal Spec’s identity claims.

Truth conditions match exactly.

---

## 13. Normative Boundary

### Full Spec

* Normative Closure section

### Minimal Spec

* Normative Closure section

Both restrict primitives to:

* physical systems
* intrinsic constraint
* regime dynamics

### Equivalence Result

Both define the same theory boundary.

No extension is permitted in one that would violate the other.

---

## 14. Formal Equivalence Statement

Let:

* **F₁₀.₅** = the set of all normative commitments derivable from the Full Spec
* **M₁₀.₅** = the set of all normative commitments derivable from the Minimal Spec

Then:

1. ∀c ∈ F₁₀.₅, ∃c′ ∈ M₁₀.₅ such that c ≡ c′
2. ∀c ∈ M₁₀.₅, ∃{c₁…cₙ} ⊆ F₁₀.₅ such that c ≡ ⋀cᵢ

Therefore:

> **F₁₀.₅ ≡ M₁₀.₅**

They are two **normal forms** of the same normative theory.

---

## 15. Functional Difference (Non-Normative)

| Aspect            | Full Spec               | Minimal Spec           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Purpose           | Exhaustive articulation | Maximal compression    |
| Style             | Enumerative             | Axiomatic              |
| Audience          | Pedagogical / audit     | Citation / portability |
| Normative content | Complete                | Complete               |

These differences are **presentational only**.

---

## Final Certification

**IER v10.5 Full** and **IER v10.5 Minimal**:

* define the same ontology
* impose the same experiential identity conditions
* entail the same ethical consequences
* admit the same admissible worlds
* exclude the same alternatives

They are **normatively interchangeable**.

> The Full Spec makes everything explicit.
> The Minimal Spec makes nothing optional.

They are the same theory, expressed at different resolutions.
