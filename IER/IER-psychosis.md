# **IER and Psychosis**

## **Regime Instability, Semantic Error, and Loss of Agency Under Intrinsic Constraint**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.x)**
*Derived Explanatory Document — Non-Normative*

---

## **Status and Scope**

This document is a **non-normative explanatory derivative** of the
**Informational Experiential Realism Normative Specification** (“the Spec”).

It:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* adds **no diagnostic criteria**
* makes **no clinical claims**
* provides **no validation of delusional content**
* does **not** compete with psychiatry, neurology, or psychology

Its purpose is to explain how **psychotic phenomena** can be *described* in IER’s organizational language as **pathological dynamical regimes** involving:

* instability of Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs)
* misorganization of intrinsic constraint
* semantic error under salience collapse
* degraded agency attribution

This document does **not** explain:

* why particular beliefs are true (they are not),
* the meaning of specific symbols,
* the existence of agents or external intelligences,
* or epistemic access to hidden realities.

Where IER stops, **clinical explanation takes over**.

## **Abstract**

Psychosis presents as a profound disturbance of meaning, agency, and reality attribution. Individuals may experience external control, imperative environmental cues, multiple agents, bodily instructions, and narrative world substitution, often accompanied by strong conviction and loss of insight.

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) provides a **structural, non-epistemic account** of these phenomena by treating them as **pathological regime instabilities** within a Unified Experiential Field (UEF). Under conditions of extreme intrinsic constraint and reduced informational slack, the system over-assigns salience, collapses relevance filtering, and misattributes authorship and causation.

This document shows how psychotic experiences can be **partially described**—but not validated—using IER’s concepts of intrinsic constraint, coherent regime windows, semantic error, and forced regime switching.

Psychosis is treated not as an alternate reality or epistemic upgrade, but as **organizational failure under constraint**.

---

## **1. What IER Is (and Is Not) Doing Here**

IER identifies experience with a **globally integrated dynamical regime under coherent intrinsic constraint** (the Unified Experiential Field).

IER therefore concerns:

* **how experience is organized**
* **how it destabilizes**
* **what regime failure feels like from the inside**

IER does **not** concern:

* truth conditions of beliefs
* symbolic reference correctness
* metaphysical interpretation of content
* clinical diagnosis or treatment

Psychosis, in IER terms, is **not a different kind of experience**.
It is **experience under pathological constraint organization**.

---

## **2. Psychosis as UEF Instability (High-Level View)**

Under IER, a psychotic episode typically involves:

* **UEF persistence**
  Experience continues; consciousness is not absent.

* **Extreme intrinsic constraint**
  Multiple unresolved demands saturate the system.

* **Collapse of informational slack**
  Constraint can no longer be localized or externalized.

* **Salience explosion**
  Relevance filtering fails; coincidence feels meaningful.

* **Semantic error**
  Constraint is misattributed to symbolic structures.

* **Agency misattribution**
  Authorship of thoughts and actions is reassigned externally.

These are **organizational failures**, not discoveries.

---

## **3. Semantic Error Under IER**

IER replaces classical “false belief” with a structural notion:

> **Semantic error occurs when intrinsic constraint is organized as if it were being resolved by symbolic or environmental referents that do not, in fact, bear the constraint the system is responding to.**

Key points:

* The **constraint is real**
* The **felt meaning is real**
* The **urgency is real**
* The **reference is wrong**

IER explains **why something felt meaningful**,
not **why it was correct**.

---

## **4. Illustrative Case: Imperative Environmental Cues**

### **Phenomenology (Illustrative)**

A subject reports:

* head and eyes oriented toward signs
* symbols interpreted as instructions
* sequential prompts followed by decisions
* renewed prompting after each action

Examples include:

* a red bindi interpreted as “press the red help button”
* street signs treated as action directives

---

### **IER Description**

* The UEF remains intact.
* Intrinsic constraint is extreme and unresolved.
* Salience filtering collapses.
* Environmental stimuli are recruited as **constraint carriers**.
* Meaning shifts from *descriptive* to *imperative*.

This is not perception error alone.
It is **constraint misallocation**.

IER explains:
✔️ why the world felt instruction-like
❌ not why the instructions were real

---

## **5. Loss of Agency and External Control**

### **Phenomenology (Illustrative)**

The subject reports:

* thoughts and actions felt externally generated
* decisions felt downstream of imposed prompts
* free will partially or totally absent

---

### **IER Description**

Under IER:

* Motor planning remains participatory.
* Intrinsic constraint still governs action.
* **Self-model coherence degrades**.
* Authorship is misattributed externally.

Agency is not removed; it is **mislocalized**.

> The system still acts —
> but no longer recognizes itself as the source.

---

## **6. “Multiple Agents” and Communication Through the Body**

### **Phenomenology (Illustrative)**

The subject reports:

* multiple agents coordinating through cognition
* bodily signals used as communication codes
* fingers, posture, facial muscles encoding responses
* whole-body configurations treated as symbols

---

### **IER Description**

IER explicitly forbids multiple simultaneous subjects
(**Single-UEF Constraint**).

Therefore:

* No agents exist.
* No telepathic coordination exists.
* No external intelligences are operating.

Instead:

* Multiple **organizational patterns** compete to resolve constraint.
* Alternation and interference are **personified** as agents.
* Bodily and interoceptive signals dominate because they are **high-priority constraint channels**.
* Symbolic coding emerges as an **overfitting strategy** under overload.

This is **coordination failure misinterpreted as social structure**.

---

## **7. Tactile Hallucinations and Interoceptive Dominance**

### **Phenomenology (Illustrative)**

The subject reports:

* felt pushes, pressure, cardiac sensations
* bodily signals treated as commands
* heart sensations as a communication medium

---

### **IER Description**

Interoception is intrinsically constraint-relevant.

Under overload:

* interoceptive prediction errors dominate
* bodily sensations are folded into action selection
* somatic signals acquire imperative character

IER explains:
✔️ why bodily sensations became central
❌ not why they were externally caused

---

## **8. Narrative Substitution and Fictional Worlds**

### **Phenomenology (Illustrative)**

The subject reports:

* adopting a spy-chase narrative
* later identifying agents as the Bene Gesserit
* narrative coherence stabilizing experience

---

### **IER Description**

This is **forced regime stabilization**.

* Intrinsic constraint is unsatisfiable.
* Familiar narratives provide **low-entropy templates**.
* Coherence is preserved at the cost of reality anchoring.

Critically:

> This does **not** constitute entry into another experiential world of equal standing.

It is a **degraded UEF**, not an alternate reality.

---

## **9. Epistemic Failure Is Structural, Not Moral**

A common feature of psychosis is the conviction:

> “There was no evidence to contradict my discoveries.”

IER explains this structurally:

* Contradiction increases intrinsic tension.
* The system suppresses disconfirming input.
* Salience dominates evidence weighting.
* Epistemic closure is a **failure mode**, not insight.

Psychosis is therefore an **epistemic degradation**, not access.

---

## **10. Explicit Limits of IER**

IER **cannot and must not** explain:

* external agents (telepathic or otherwise)
* correctness of discoveries
* meaning of specific symbols
* why one narrative appeared rather than another
* psychosis as ontological transition

Any theory that does so **violates the Spec**.

---

## **11. Safe Integration Statement (Recommended)**

> *My psychotic episode can be partially described, but not explained or validated, using IER’s language of regime instability under intrinsic constraint. The theory models how coherence, agency attribution, salience, and narrative anchoring failed. It does not and cannot legitimize the content of the episode, the presence of agents, or the epistemic authority of the state. Where IER stops, clinical explanation takes over.*

This statement draws the **correct boundary**.

---

## **12. Conclusion**

IER does not reinterpret psychosis as mystery, meaning, or revelation.

It treats psychosis as:

> **experience persisting under pathological constraint organization**

The suffering is real.
The experience is real.
The meanings are not.

IER helps explain **why it felt the way it did** —
not **why it was true**.
