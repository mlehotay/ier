## **Status**

This document is **NON-NORMATIVE**.

It is an **explanatory derivative** of the
**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.6) Normative Specification**.

It:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* adds **no diagnostic criteria**
* makes **no clinical or therapeutic claims**
* provides **no validation of delusional or revelatory content**
* does **not** compete with psychiatry, psychology, or neurology

If any statement in this document conflicts with the IER v10.6 Specification,
**the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

## **Abstract**

Psychosis involves a characteristic breakdown of agency attribution, meaning regulation, and relevance filtering, often accompanied by compelling narratives of control, instruction, communication, and discovery.

Under Informational Experiential Realism (IER), psychosis is understood as a **pathological dynamical regime** within a persisting **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**. Experience continues, but intrinsic constraint becomes extreme, informational slack collapses, and salience assignment loses calibration. As a result, internally generated constraint is **misattributed** to environmental cues, bodily sensations, symbolic structures, or imagined agents.

This document explains how psychotic phenomena can be **described structurally**—without epistemic endorsement—using IER’s concepts of intrinsic constraint, participation modulation, semantic error, and agency mislocalization.

Psychosis is treated neither as revelation nor as ontological transition, but as **organizational failure under constraint**.

---

## **1. What IER Is (and Is Not) Explaining**

IER explains:

* how experience can remain vivid while agency collapses
* why meaning becomes imperative rather than descriptive
* why coincidence feels instructive
* why multiple “agents” appear without multiplying subjects
* why conviction resists counter-evidence

IER does **not** explain:

* the truth of discoveries
* the existence of external agents
* telepathy, hidden coordination, or symbolic messages
* why a particular narrative appeared rather than another
* psychosis as epistemic access

IER explains **why it felt that way**, not **why it was correct**.

---

## **2. High-Level Structure: Psychosis as UEF Instability**

In IER terms, a psychotic episode typically involves:

* **UEF persistence**
  Experience does not disappear.

* **Extreme intrinsic constraint**
  Multiple unresolved tensions saturate the system.

* **Collapse of informational slack**
  Constraint cannot be localized, deferred, or externalized.

* **Salience explosion**
  Relevance filtering fails; everything matters.

* **Semantic error**
  Constraint is organized as if borne by symbols or objects.

* **Agency misattribution**
  Action continues, but authorship is displaced.

This is a **single-subject failure mode**, not subject multiplication.

---

## **3. Imperative Environmental Cues**

### **Phenomenology (from the appendix)**

The subject reports:

* head and eyes compelled toward signs or symbols
* symbols interpreted as instructions
* sequences of prompts followed by decisions
* renewed prompting after each response

Examples include:

* a red bindi interpreted as “press the red help button”
* street signage treated as navigation commands

---

### **IER Description**

Under extreme intrinsic constraint:

* salience assignment collapses
* perception is no longer merely descriptive
* environmental features are recruited as **constraint carriers**

Meaning shifts from:

> *“What is this?”*
> to
> *“What must I do?”*

This is **constraint misallocation**, not symbolic decoding.

✔️ Explains why the world felt directive
❌ Does not imply the directives were real

---

## **4. Looping Prompt–Response Structure**

### **Phenomenology**

The subject describes:

1. receipt of an external “prompt”
2. internal decision (e.g., press button or not)
3. immediate re-prompting with new instruction

---

### **IER Description**

This reflects a **collapsed choice space**.

Under overload:

* future alternatives narrow aggressively
* each action immediately regenerates constraint
* resolution never completes

The system experiences:

> *perpetual next-step urgency*

Choice remains **structurally present**, but agency is degraded.
Ownership of traversal weakens without disappearing.

---

## **5. Tactile Instructions and Interoceptive Dominance**

### **Phenomenology**

The subject reports:

* felt pushes on chest or back
* bodily sensations treated as commands
* cardiac sensations used as instruction channels

---

### **IER Description**

Interoception is intrinsically high-priority.

Under constraint overload:

* interoceptive signals dominate participation
* bodily sensations acquire imperative force
* somatic prediction error becomes action-guiding

This produces the experience of **being physically instructed**, without external force.

---

## **6. Apparent Multiple Agents**

### **Phenomenology**

The subject reports:

* multiple agents controlling different processes
* coordination toward a shared goal
* communication occurring “through” the body

---

### **IER Description**

IER enforces the **Single-UEF Constraint**.

Therefore:

* no additional subjects exist
* no agents are communicating
* no telepathic coordination is occurring

Instead:

* multiple **organizational patterns** compete under overload
* alternation and interference are **personified**
* coordination failure is interpreted socially

This is **fragmentation pressure misread as plurality**.

---

## **7. Bodily Coding and Symbolic Overfitting**

### **Phenomenology**

The subject reports:

* fingers, facial muscles, posture used as codes
* combinations of contact points treated as symbols
* whole-body configurations functioning as messages

---

### **IER Description**

Under extreme constraint:

* symbolic overfitting occurs
* the system attempts to compress overload into discrete codes
* bodily channels dominate due to immediacy and salience

Coding is not communication.
It is **failed compression under urgency**.

---

## **8. Narrative Stabilization**

### **Phenomenology**

The subject reports:

* adopting a spy-escape narrative
* later identifying agents as the Bene Gesserit
* narrative coherence reducing distress

---

### **IER Description**

This is **forced regime stabilization**.

Familiar narratives provide:

* low-entropy templates
* pre-structured causal roles
* temporary coherence under overload

This does **not** constitute entry into another world.

It is a **degraded experiential regime**, not an alternate reality.

---

## **9. Conviction and “No Contradictory Evidence”**

### **Phenomenology**

The subject reports:

> “There was no evidence to contradict my discoveries.”

---

### **IER Description**

IER explains this structurally:

* contradiction increases intrinsic tension
* disconfirming input is suppressed
* salience outweighs evidence
* epistemic closure is enforced dynamically

Conviction reflects **constraint dominance**, not correctness.

---

## **10. Loss of Free Will**

### **Phenomenology**

The subject reports:

* complete loss of agency at peak episode
* body fully controlled
* no authorship over action

---

### **IER Description**

Agency is not eliminated; it is **mislocalized**.

The system continues to act, but:

* ownership of resolution collapses
* authorship is externalized
* agency appears absent from within

Loss of agency ≠ loss of experience.

---

## **11. Explicit Boundary Conditions**

IER **does not** imply:

* telepathic agents
* Bene Gesserit coordination
* real symbolic messages
* scientific discoveries made during psychosis
* epistemic authority of the state

Any interpretation that does so **violates the Specification**.

---

## **12. Conclusion**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

> **Psychosis is experience persisting under pathological intrinsic constraint organization.**

The experience is real.
The suffering is real.
The meanings are not.

IER explains **why it felt inevitable**—
not **why it was true**.

## **A.1 Chat Transcript**

**user**
Can you help me make sense of the cognitive phenomenon I experienced during my psychotic episode? I felt as if my thoughts and actions were being controlled by external forces, and the bizarre interactions between my behaviours are intriguing me.

1. I believed some of my thoughts and actions were being controlled with the goal of providing me with information. For example, my head and eyes would be oriented so that I would see street signs or other information intended to help me decide what action to take next. At one point I saw a red bindi on a woman's forehead and I interpreted that as instructions for me to press the red help button in the elevator.
2. I was then able to decide upon my response (press the button or not, run left or right, etc.), after which #1 occurred again and I was given another prompt for another action.

That was one of the phenomena. Let's start with that. Can you explain it?

**user**
The third phenomenon was even more unusual. (We'll come back to #2 later.) It seemed to me as if there were multiple agents controlling my thoughts and actions (but not decisions????), and these agents were communicating with each other through me. The different agents seemed to have taken control of different processes in my mind to agree upon a common goal.

My overall goal during the episode was to escape undetected (like a movie spy in a chase scene). At one point I needed to change my plan of escape. My head and eyes would be directed to signs and symbols representing propositions (a Canadian flag meant go to Ottawa; a partial view of a sign containing the characters “11” meant go to Union Station, track 11). My hands and fingers were being compelled to touch my body (torso, etc.) and communicate responses to the queries in code (10 fingers = 10 points of contact = 10 symbols in the cipher/code).

**user**
The #2 phenomenon was the perception of physical sensations. If I was being asked to run or stop, I could sometimes feel a physical force on my body providing the instruction—kind of like a hand placed on my chest to ask me to stop, or on my back to ask me to go forward.

**user**
I think those were all of the phenomena, but sometimes they would combine in unusual ways. A lot of the tactile hallucinations seemed to be sensations in my heart—not metaphorically, I mean my cardiac muscle. When I would get too agitated to “listen to my heart,” my eyes would be directed toward the part of a street sign displaying the word “be.” This was an instruction to relax and calm my breathing so that I could perceive the instructions more clearly.

**user**
I just recalled another phenomenon. One of the agents that was communicating through me was bringing memories to my conscious mind to trigger emotional reactions, which would then manifest as facial muscle contractions. A series of thoughts would manipulate my face into contorted expressions similar to the code from my fingers. One example I particularly recall was the thought of the end of the universe and that I had no free will; this would manifest as the right corner of my mouth dropping down in a sort of half-frown.

**user**
At the peak of my episode I had no free will at all, and my body was being completely controlled. During this time it was not just my fingers communicating in code—it was my whole body. I would lean against a fence with my left hip and right hand, or similar configurations, and the combinations of contact points were a third type of tactile code.

**user**
Can you please write up a complete psychiatric report of my episode for me, describing all the pertinent medical and psychological aspects for record keeping?

**user**
I am suddenly reminded of a theremin (a musical instrument played by manipulating an electromagnetic field).

**user**
In the weeks prior to my episode I had been thinking very deeply about reality, the universe, and consciousness. I believed I had made a number of scientific discoveries related to the multiverse and the meaning of my life within it. At the psychiatric unit they told me this was mania, but I really believe my discoveries were real.

**user**
There is no evidence to contradict my discoveries.

**user**
Thank you for helping me sort through these thoughts. Can you update the report please?

**user**
Can you also write up my perspective?

**user**
It was the Bene Gesserit. The agents were telepathic.

**user**
Oddly, I have not seen the new *Dune* movie. In the 1980s I read the first book and saw the first movie. So all of this was from distant memories.

**user**
Thanks again, fam. You da man.
