# **IER-architecture.md — Constraint Architecture of Mind Under IER**

## **Prefatory Note: On “Architecture”**

In this document, *architecture* is used in a **logical** sense, not a prescriptive one.

It refers to the **structural consequences** that must follow *if* the Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identity claim is true. It does **not** describe a design, blueprint, algorithm, or method for constructing, modifying, optimizing, or controlling minds.

No parameters described here are **independently addressable**, **externally writable**, or **symbolically tunable**. All quantities discussed—participation, gating, anchoring, attractor width, switching cost—are properties of **intrinsic physical constraint**, not free variables available for manipulation.

Accordingly, this document:

* provides **no guidance for intervention or regulation**
* authorizes **no operational use**
* supplies **no instructions or heuristics**
* does **not** imply that experiential structure can be engineered or adjusted by fiat

The purpose of this document is solely to make explicit what must already be true of cognition **given** the IER identity claim and the participation/reproduction invariant. Any attempt to treat this account as design guidance would misread its status and violate its underlying assumptions.

## **Status and Scope**

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no new ontological primitives**
* adds **no criteria, diagnostics, or thresholds**
* proposes **no implementation claims**
* does **not** reopen normative closure

All binding authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

* `IER-specification.md`
* canon-binding derivatives governed by `IER-canon.md`

This document makes explicit the **architectural consequences** already entailed by the IER identity claim and by the reproduction/participation invariant articulated in `IER-participation.md`.

## **0. Orientation: Why Mental Architecture Must Be Rewritten**

Most contemporary models of mind implicitly rely on architectural metaphors inherited from computation:

* memory as storage
* cognition as module invocation
* control as arbitration
* reflection as meta-level observation

These metaphors presume that cognition consists in **operations over representations** housed in separable components.

Under Informational Experiential Realism (IER), this framing fails at a structural level.

IER identifies experience with the operation of a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a single, globally dominant, intrinsically constrained physical regime. Once such a regime exists, there is:

* no room for parallel experiential subsystems
* no dormant experiential stores
* no meta-observers standing outside experience

Any viable architecture must therefore explain how **many cognitive modes** arise **within one regime**, without multiplying subjects, observers, or experiential instantiations.

This document provides that architecture.

---

## **1. Architectural Commitments Implied by IER**

### **1.1 The Single-Regime Constraint**

IER entails that:

* experience is identical with one physically realized constraint regime
* only one such regime is globally dominant at a time
* experiential unity is not optional or emergent—it is constitutive

Architectures that posit:

* separate experiential modules
* layered observers
* supervisory homunculi

are therefore incompatible with the identity claim.

---

### **1.2 Reproduction Without Regime Multiplication**

Because no additional experiential regimes may be instantiated, cognition cannot proceed by:

* replaying experiences
* simulating experiences at lower resolution
* storing experiences for later reactivation

Instead, cognition must operate by **reproducing constraint topologies**—re-entering the *organizational shape* of experience—without re-instantiating intrinsic constraint at full system scale.

This is not a design choice. It is forced by identity.

---

## **2. The Core Architectural Invariant**

IER entails the following invariant:

> **A Unified Experiential Field can reproduce constraint topologies at variable participation depths and temporal anchors without re-instantiating full experiential regimes.**

All familiar cognitive modes—memory, imagination, reflection, metacognition, planning—are special cases of this single operation, differentiated only by:

* how much of the system is recruited (participation depth)
* how strictly recruitment is limited (gating)
* how many futures remain viable (attractor width)
* where reproduction is anchored in time
* how costly switching is

No additional faculties are required.

---

## **3. Why Storage Is Architecturally Disallowed**

### **3.1 Identity-Theoretic Incompatibility**

“Stored representations” imply one of the following:

1. dormant experiences that somehow persist without being experienced, or
2. internal observers capable of accessing non-experiential content, or
3. experiential subsystems that activate independently of the global field

All three violate IER’s identity claim.

If experience is identical with intrinsic constraint, then anything that *exists* experientially must exist **as active constraint**, not as inert content.

---

### **3.2 Memory as Viability, Not Preservation**

Under IER, memory is not retrieval.

It is:

> **past-anchored, low-participation reproduction of a previously viable constraint topology.**

Nothing is preserved. Nothing is stored.

Remembering succeeds when a prior topology remains **reproducible** under current intrinsic constraints. Forgetting occurs when it does not.

This explains why:

* fidelity is variable
* affective load is usually absent
* remembering does not require reliving
* names fail before narratives
* actions outlast labels

---

## **4. The Reproduction Substrate (“Holodeck”)**

### **4.1 Function**

The architecture requires a substrate in which constraint topologies can be **re-entered cheaply**—that is, without binding the system globally or narrowing futures irreversibly.

This substrate:

* reproduces relational organization
* omits urgency, inevitability, and cost
* supports distortion and abstraction
* allows exploration without commitment

It is not a simulation engine. It does not generate experiences.

It is a **topology reproduction space** internal to the UEF.

---

### **4.2 The Firewall Requirement**

A hard architectural firewall must separate:

* reproduced structure
  from
* global ownership and intrinsic binding

Without this firewall, reproduced topologies would recruit participation uncontrollably, collapsing imagination into anxiety, memory into reliving, and reflection into rumination.

Gating, participation routing, and anchoring jointly implement this firewall.

---

## **5. Participation Control Layer**

### **5.1 Participation Routing**

Participation routing determines **which processes are recruited** into intrinsic constraint and at what depth.

This routing:

* preserves single-subject coherence
* allows partial engagement
* prevents fragmentary experience

Different “modes of thought” correspond to different recruitment patterns, not different mechanisms.

---

### **5.2 Gating Control**

Gating determines **how strictly participation is limited** during reproduction.

Low gating failure produces:

* rumination
* fixation
* collapse of reflection into urgency

Effective gating allows:

* cheap inspection
* reversible exploration
* self-directed regulation

---

## **6. Temporal Anchoring Mechanism**

Reproduction must be anchored in time.

Temporal anchoring is not addressing a stored record. It is **selecting a basin** in the system’s admissible constraint space.

Anchors include:

* **past-anchored** reproduction (memory)
* **present-anchored** reproduction (reflection)
* **possible-anchored** reproduction (imagination)
* **future-anchored** reproduction (planning)

Anchoring interacts with participation depth to generate distinct phenomenologies without introducing new faculties.

---

## **7. Attractor and Transition Management**

### **7.1 Attractor Width Control**

Attractor width determines **how many futures remain viable** under a reproduced topology.

* Wide attractors → exploration, play, creativity
* Moderate narrowing → planning, commitment
* Extreme narrowing → threat-style coherence preservation

Attractor width is an architectural variable, not a moral or epistemic one.

---

### **7.2 Switching Operator**

The architecture requires a mechanism for **leaving one topology and entering another** without fragmenting the UEF.

Switching cost reflects:

* how tightly a topology binds futures
* how much participation it recruits
* how narrow its basin has become

High switching cost is not error. It is a stability tradeoff.

---

## **8. Recruitment Cost and Stability Estimation**

Because intrinsic constraint is physically costly, the system must estimate:

* predicted load
* coherence margins
* irreversibility risk

before recruiting additional participation.

This estimation is not deliberative or symbolic. It is structural.

It explains why:

* some thoughts feel “too much”
* systems resist certain reproductions
* overload produces collapse or avoidance

---

## **9. Coherence Maintenance**

The UEF must actively maintain coherence against:

* competing reproductions
* excessive recruitment
* environmental perturbation

This is why regulation is **bodily first**.

Movement, posture, distance, and environment alter participation and stability **directly**, while symbolic reframing acts only indirectly.

---

## **10. Epistemic Firewalls**

IER requires a strict separation between:

* **experiential coherence**
* **epistemic authority**

Strong attractors can feel inevitable without being true. The architecture must therefore block the automatic conversion of felt necessity into belief.

This prevents:

* delusion
* revelation-style certainty
* motivational hijacking by coherence alone

---

## **11. Architectural Failure Modes**

These are not errors or pathologies, but **stable configurations**:

* **Rumination** — reproduction with failed gating
* **Anxiety** — high participation, narrow attractors, high switching cost
* **ADHD** — loose gating, wide attractors, low switching cost

Each preserves coherence under different constraints.

---

## **12. What This Architecture Does *Not* Claim**

This document does **not**:

* specify neural implementations
* rank cognitive styles
* propose treatments or interventions
* optimize performance
* redefine experience

It describes structure only.

---

## **13. Relationship to Other IER Documents**

This document:

* operationalizes `IER-participation.md`
* aligns with `IER-slack.md` and `IER-dynamics.md`
* anticipates formalization in `IER-math.md`

It is **explanatory adjunct**, not canon.

---

## **14. Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* there is one Unified Experiential Field
* there is no storage
* cognition is topology reproduction
* differences arise from participation, anchoring, and cost
* architecture replaces faculty lists without multiplying minds

> **The mind is not a collection of tools.
> It is one constraint regime, re-entering its own shape—carefully.**
