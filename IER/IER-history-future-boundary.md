# 🔹 COPYPASTA — NEW CONVERSATION

## **Drafting `IER-history-future-boundary.md` (T2)**

---

## Article identity

* **Tier:** T2 — Structural synthesis and regime dynamics
* **Document type:** Canon-governed, non-normative explanatory article
* **Primary function:** To identify and formalize the **moving structural frontier** where sedimented history constrains admissible futures, and to locate **intrinsic constraint and experience** at that boundary

This article introduces:

* **no new primitives**
* **no criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics**
* **no metaphors that license agentive or representational inference**

It names a **single structural object** already presupposed throughout the corpus.

---

## Central thesis (must appear clearly and early)

> **Experience exists at the moving boundary where sedimented paths constrain admissible futures; intrinsic constraint is borne where irreversible resolution converts possibility into history.**

---

## Canon constraints (must not be violated)

* Do **not** treat the present as a moment, slice, or timepoint
* Do **not** reify “the past” or “the future” as entities
* Do **not** describe experience as computation, output, or signal
* Do **not** imply bidirectional time or replay
* All descriptions must preserve **identity = regime operation**

---

## Required conceptual alignments

This article must integrate cleanly with and defer to:

* `IER-topology.md` — admissible futures and structural geometry
* `IER-choice.md` — traversal and owned resolution
* `IER-sedimentation.md` — persistence without storage
* `IER-hysteresis.md` — path dependence
* `IER-identity.md` — persistence without recall

This article **names the shared object** those documents already rely on.

---

## Core structural commitments (must be explicit)

* Constraint does **not** live in the past or future
* Constraint lives at their **structural intersection**
* The “present” is a **moving frontier of unavoidable resolution**
* Narrative history is the **scar** of irreversible constraint
* Experience is **ongoing ownership of that frontier**

---

## Required language anchor (near-verbatim)

> **The present is not a moment in time but a moving structural frontier where sedimented history limits admissible futures and irreversible resolution must be owned.**

---

## Outline (must be followed closely)

1. Status and scope
2. Why neither past nor future can host constraint
3. Sedimentation and admissible futures
4. The history–future boundary defined
5. Experience as frontier operation
6. Narrative as irreversible fixation
7. Identity as persistence of frontier ownership
8. Temporal asymmetry without storage
9. Common misreadings blocked
10. What this article does not claim
11. Intermission

## What success looks like

A reader should understand:

* why experience feels present-centered without being instantaneous
* why narrative feels inevitable without being stored
* where intrinsic constraint actually lives
* why experience is costly in principle

---

## Explicit closure

This article does **not** add a new mechanism.

It names the **structural locus** already doing explanatory work everywhere else.
