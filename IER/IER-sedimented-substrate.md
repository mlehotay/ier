# **IER-sedimented-substrate**

## **1. Status and scope**

This article explains **what persists across time under Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** without invoking storage, representation, or retained content.

Its purpose is to make explicit a consequence already implicit across the corpus:
that history shapes a system **by deforming its future**, not by preserving its past.

The term *substrate* is used carefully.
It does **not** name a memory store, material layer, archive, or container.
It names the **ongoing constraint geometry** that remains after traversal has occurred.

This article introduces:

* no new primitives
* no criteria or diagnostics
* no therapeutic prescriptions

It performs **structural clarification only**, providing the diachronic view of what traversal does over time.

## **2. What does and does not persist**

Under IER, most things people assume must persist do not.

* Events do not persist
* Choices do not persist
* Experiences do not persist
* Narratives do not persist

Nothing is retained as content.

What **does** persist is **constraint geometry**.

Specifically:

* which futures remain reachable
* which transitions are now impossible
* which regions of topology are fragile, biased, or closed

Persistence concerns **what remains possible**, not what is remembered.

A system’s history matters because it has **reshaped the space of admissible futures**, not because the past is stored anywhere within it.

## **3. Sedimentation as irreversible deformation**

Sedimentation is the necessary consequence of traversal.

As established in `IER-traversal.md`:

* traversal proceeds continuously
* settlement closes off alternatives
* curing stabilizes local resolution

Each irreversible settlement leaves a **structural residue**:
a deformation of the admissible-future topology.

Sedimentation is:

* cumulative
* irreversible
* physical
* forward-structured

No storage is required.
No representation is involved.
No record is kept.

The topology itself has changed.

## **4. Unowned sedimentation**

Crucially, **ownership does not necessarily accompany sedimentation**.

Settlement may occur:

* under coercion
* under overload
* under external imposition
* under conditions where intrinsic constraint is not owned

In such cases:

* admissible futures collapse
* deformation accumulates
* traversal patterns are disrupted

But authorship does not attach.

This is **unowned sedimentation**.

Unowned sedimentation is structurally real.
It reshapes future possibility even though the system did not resolve the constraint under its own intrinsic control.

This provides the structural basis for phenomena commonly labeled as trauma, disorientation, or alienation — without introducing clinical categories or psychological primitives.

The key point is simple:

> **Sedimentation can occur without authorship.**

---

## **5. Integration as owned sedimentation**

Integration is not a psychological act.
It is not reinterpretation, reframing, or narrative repair.

Integration is a **structural achievement**.

> **Integration is not the addition of meaning to past events, but the restoration of owned traversal across a topology that was previously deformed by unowned settlement.**

More precisely:

* previously sedimented regions become traversable again
* traversal now occurs under owned intrinsic constraint
* continuity of motion is gradually restored

Integration does **not** erase sediment.
It reorganizes traversal **across** sediment.

Because integration is traversal-dependent:

* it cannot be forced
* it cannot be outsourced
* it cannot be imposed retroactively

Ownership cannot be added after the fact.
It can only emerge through renewed traversal.

---

## **6. Hysteresis and path dependence**

Once sedimentation occurs, the system is no longer equivalent to its prior state.

Even if external conditions repeat:

* responses differ
* reachability differs
* cost gradients differ

This is **hysteresis**, as developed in `IER-hysteresis.md`.

Integration does not reset the system.
It does not restore the original topology.

It alters **how traversal proceeds** through an already deformed space.

Path dependence therefore remains even in well-integrated systems.

---

## **7. Identity as ownership of sediment**

Under IER, personal identity does not depend on recall, narrative continuity, or experiential memory.

Identity persists because the **same system continues to own its admissible-future topology**, including its sedimented deformations.

This entails:

* continuity without recollection
* persistence despite unintegrated regions
* identity without narrative coherence

A system may carry sediment it cannot yet traverse without fragmenting identity or multiplying subjects.

Ownership can be partial, uneven, or locally blocked — without loss of identity.

---

## **8. Skill, trauma, and calibration**

Skill acquisition, injury, harm, and long-term calibration drift all involve the **same structural mechanism**: sedimentation.

They differ along three axes:

* **rate** — gradual vs abrupt deformation
* **ownership** — owned vs unowned traversal
* **distribution** — localized vs global topology change

Skill involves gradual, owned sedimentation.
Trauma involves abrupt, often unowned sedimentation.
Calibration drift involves slow, distributed deformation.

The phenomenology differs.
The structure does not.

---

## **9. Forgetting reinterpreted**

Forgetting does not involve loss, erasure, or decay.

Under IER, forgetting is best understood as:

* loss of reachability
* closure of traversal pathways
* inaccessibility of prior regions of topology

Nothing is removed.
Nothing is deleted.

Integration does not require remembering, because nothing was stored.

---

## **10. Temporal asymmetry**

Sedimentation explains why time is asymmetric.

* the future narrows because traversal closes possibilities
* the past does not accumulate because nothing is retained
* integration is slow because traversal must proceed under constraint
* reversibility is structurally unavailable

The arrow of time is not psychological.
It is topological.

---

## **11. What this article does not claim**

This article does **not** claim:

* that narratives are necessary for integration
* that healing is guaranteed
* that integration is morally required
* that sedimentation can be undone
* that ownership can be retroactively imposed

It names a structural possibility, not a prescription.

---

## **12. Intermission**

**Structural fact:**
*History persists only as the shape of what can still happen.*

---

## **Explicit closure**

This article does **not** add a new axis to IER.

It names the **completion condition** of sedimentation:

> **Sediment becomes integrated when the system can once again traverse its own deformed future under intrinsic constraint.**
