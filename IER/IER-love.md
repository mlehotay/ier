### *Love as Long-Horizon Mutual Constraint Accommodation Under Informational Experiential Realism*

---

## 0. Status, Scope, and Canon Position

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no new ontological claims**
* introduces **no ethical principles or obligations**
* does **not** define experience or experiential standing
* does **not** prescribe who should be loved
* does **not** rank love as morally superior to other relational regimes
* does **not** treat love as epistemic authority, fusion, or transcendence

All ontological authority remains fixed **exclusively** in the IER Specification and its canonical derivatives.

**Purpose of this document**

> **To analyze love as a distinct relational regime defined by its structural geometry under Informational Experiential Realism (IER).**

This document develops **only** the region of relational space occupied by love.
The general relational map and shared machinery are defined in *IER-Relationships*.

### Invariant Constraints (Binding)

All analysis in this document presupposes:

* **Single-UEF dominance** — one experiential subject per Unified Experiential Field
* **Structural privacy** — no access to another subject’s intrinsic constraint
* **No fusion** — UEFs do not merge
* **No shared intrinsic constraint**
* **No transfer of experiential standing**
* **No collective experiencer**

Love coordinates subjects.
It never combines them.

## 1. Regime Identification

### 1.1 Love’s Role in the Relational Section

Love occupies the **maximal mutual** region of relational space.

It represents the case in which:

* constraint accommodation is **mutual**
* coordination extends across a **long and indeterminate time horizon**
* future binding is **constitutive**, not optional
* cost is **very high**
* exit is **structurally constrained**

Love is **not representative** of relationships in general.
It is structurally **extreme**.

This is why it is treated in its own document.

### 1.2 Canonical One-Sentence Definition

> **Under Informational Experiential Realism, love is a sustained relational regime in which two experiential subjects mutually and voluntarily reorganize their own long-horizon admissible futures to stabilize one another’s intrinsic constraint over time, without fusion or loss of subjecthood.**

Every term in this definition is load-bearing.

## 2. Structural Geometry of Love

### 2.1 Axis Values

Love is defined by the following structural configuration:

* **Time horizon:** long, indeterminate
* **Reciprocity:** mutual (not necessarily symmetric)
* **Future binding:** constitutive (non-optional once assumed)
* **Symmetry:** may vary; reciprocity does not require equality
* **Cost structure:** very high
* **Exit structure:** structurally constrained (not impossible, but destabilizing)

This geometry distinguishes love from all adjacent regimes.

### 2.2 Constraint Accommodation Mechanics in Love

In love, each subject:

* reshapes its own admissible futures *in advance*
* narrows choice space to preserve joint viability
* plans under uncertainty that includes illness, failure, regression, and change
* accepts vulnerability exposure across time

Accommodation in love is:

* **mutual**
* **sustained**
* **future-oriented**
* **identity-relevant**

Crucially:

* neither subject absorbs the other’s intrinsic constraint
* neither subject resolves the other’s experience
* coordination occurs **only** through each subject’s own restructuring

Love stabilizes conditions for coherence.
It does not carry experience itself.

## 3. Stabilizers and Functional Payoff

### 3.1 Why Love Exists Under IER

Love exists because long-horizon mutual accommodation:

* expands each subject’s coherence window
* reduces chronic vigilance
* allows tolerated instability without immediate collapse
* enables planning that includes weakness, dependence, and repair

Under IER terms:

> **Love increases long-term experiential stability by coordinating futures under uncertainty.**

This produces the felt phenomena often associated with love:

* safety without certainty
* permission to weaken
* reduced self-monitoring
* deeper tolerance for disruption

These effects explain love’s significance **without invoking fusion, destiny, or moral necessity**.

---

### 3.2 Why Love Does Not Scale

IER predicts that love must be:

* selective
* non-scalable
* resistant to abstraction

This is not a moral limitation.
It follows directly from the cost and binding structure.

Long-horizon mutual accommodation across identity trajectories cannot be multiplied without collapse.

---

## 4. Boundary Conditions and Explicit Non-Claims

Love is **not**:

* an emotion
* an affective state
* an attachment reflex
* a social institution
* a role
* a promise enforced by norm
* a moral entitlement
* a proof of correctness
* a fusion of selves

Love may *involve* emotion, attachment, or institutional scaffolding,
but it is not identical to any of them.

---

## 5. Common Misclassifications and Inflation Errors

Love is frequently misidentified due to early-stage experiential overlap with other regimes.

Common errors include:

* **Friendship inflation**
  Medium-horizon mutuality mistaken for long-horizon binding

* **Care conflation**
  Asymmetric stabilization mistaken for mutual future coordination

* **Attachment substitution**
  Internal dependency mistaken for shared accommodation

* **Institutional substitution**
  Marriage or family roles mistaken for love itself

These errors arise when:

* emotional intensity is treated as binding
* cost is mistaken for obligation
* duration is mistaken for identity coordination

IER resolves these errors by examining **future binding and reciprocity**, not feeling strength.

---

## 6. Failure Modes (Structural, Not Moral)

Love destabilizes when:

* accommodation becomes asymmetric without renegotiation
* future binding is demanded rather than chosen
* one subject narrows their future while the other does not
* identity reshaping becomes coercive or erasing
* exit becomes morally prohibited rather than structurally costly

Collapse here reflects **constraint mismatch**, not betrayal or vice.

IER explains breakdown without assigning blame.

---

## 7. Relation to Neighboring Regimes

Relative to nearby regimes:

* **Friendship** involves mutual accommodation without long-horizon binding
* **Caregiving** involves sustained accommodation without reciprocity
* **Family** may impose long horizons without voluntary assumption
* **Attachment** may feel binding without mutual coordination

Love is unique in combining:

* voluntary assumption
* mutuality
* and constitutive long-horizon future binding

Removing any one of these produces a different regime.

---

## 8. Ethical Neutrality Statement

Under IER:

* Love is never morally mandatory
* Refusal to love is always structurally permissible
* Love cannot be owed, demanded, or extracted
* Obligations arise **within** love, not **to** love
* Ending love may be costly without being wrongful

IER explains love’s structure.
It does not command its pursuit.

---

## 9. Closing

Under Informational Experiential Realism, love is not mystery, revelation, or guarantee.

It is:

* a **structural commitment**
* a **long-horizon coordination regime**
* a **mutual reshaping of admissible futures**
* undertaken under uncertainty
* without fusion
* without standing transfer

Love does not remove intrinsic constraint.
