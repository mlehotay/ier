## **One Structure, Many Projections: Constraint Geometry as the Common Substrate of Time, Memory, Identity, Agency, History, and Possibility**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**
*Explanatory Keystone Article — Non-Normative*

---

## 0. Status, Scope, and Keystone Role

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no new ontological primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, diagnostics, or mechanisms**
* revises **no definitions** elsewhere in the IER corpus
* adds **no new explanatory commitments**

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md
IER-theory.md
IER-dynamics.md
```

If any statement in this document conflicts with those texts, the conflict is resolved in their favor and the conflicting statement here is void.

### Keystone role

This document serves a **synthetic function**:

> **It makes explicit that several central IER concepts—already developed elsewhere—are projections of a single underlying structure.**

It does **not** compete with, replace, or revise those accounts.
It shows how they interlock.

---

## 1. Why a Keystone Is Needed

Across the IER corpus, distinct articles explain:

* admissible futures
* memory and forgetting
* identity and continuity
* agency, choice, and resolution
* sedimentation and hysteresis
* temporal asymmetry and continuity

Each account is locally complete and canon-aligned.

Yet readers—and authors—reliably notice a pattern:

> *These explanations feel like they are describing the same thing from different sides.*

This impression is correct.

It is not metaphorical overlap, rhetorical convenience, or conceptual vagueness.
It is a **structural consequence** of the IER identity claim.

This article names the shared object those accounts already presuppose.

---

## 2. The Explicit Claim of This Article

> **There is one underlying structure governing experiential systems under IER:
> the geometry of intrinsic constraint and admissible transition.**

Time, memory, identity, agency, history, and possibility are:

* not independent faculties
* not layered subsystems
* not parallel explanatory domains

They are **distinct projections of the same constraint geometry**, oriented toward different explanatory questions.

No new structure is added.
Only the projection is changed.

---

## 3. The Underlying Object (Already Fixed Elsewhere)

### 3.1 What IER Already Commits To

Taken together, existing IER documents already commit to:

* **globally binding intrinsic constraint**
* **admissible future trajectories**
* **irreversible resolution**
* **system-level ownership of constraint**
* **path dependence without storage**
* **regime-level continuity**

These commitments jointly define a **structured space of admissibility** governing how an experiential system can continue.

This article gives that space a single descriptive name:

> **constraint geometry**

No ontological inflation is introduced.

---

### 3.2 Why “Geometry” Is the Right Term

“Geometry” is used because:

* relations matter more than contents
* structure persists under transformation
* the same object admits multiple projections
* no coordinate system is privileged

Just as one physical object can cast many shadows without multiplying objects, one constraint geometry can appear as time, memory, identity, agency, history, or possibility depending on explanatory orientation.

---

## 4. Projections of Constraint Geometry

Each subsection below corresponds to an existing IER domain and shows how it arises as a **projection**, not as a new mechanism.

---

### 4.1 Time — Projection as Asymmetry

*(IER-dynamics, IER-continuity)*

Under IER, time is **not**:

* a container
* a background dimension
* a stored sequence

Time arises because constraint resolution is **irreversible**.

Each resolution:

* eliminates admissible alternatives
* reorganizes intrinsic constraint
* cannot be undone without regime destruction

This yields a structural asymmetry.

From the **outside**, this appears as irreversible physical evolution.
From the **inside**, it appears as passage, flow, or “now moving on.”

> **Time is what asymmetric constraint geometry looks like when traversed.**

---

### 4.2 Memory — Projection as Future Accessibility

*(IER-memory, IER-forgetting)*

IER rejects memory as storage.

Nothing experiential is retained, archived, or retrieved.

Memory instead consists in:

* continued reachability of certain experiential organizations
* preserved participation pathways
* admissibility of re-entry under current constraint

Forgetting occurs when:

* regions of the geometry become unreachable
* participation pathways are pruned
* re-entry is no longer viable

Nothing is erased.

> **Memory is not a relation to the past.
> It is a feature of future accessibility.**

---

### 4.3 Identity — Projection as Persistence of Ownership

*(IER-persistence, IER-continuity)*

Identity does not depend on:

* autobiographical recall
* narrative continuity
* psychological similarity

Identity persists iff:

* the same physical system continues
* a Unified Experiential Field is sustained
* admissible futures remain non-empty and jointly owned

Identity is therefore **forward-structured**.

It depends on what the system can still become, not on what it remembers.

> **Identity is persistence of constraint ownership across time.**

---

### 4.4 Agency — Projection as Owned Collapse

*(IER-agency, IER-choice, IER-resolution)*

Agency does not require:

* indeterminism
* deliberation
* representation of options

Agency occurs when:

* multiple admissible futures exist
* those futures collapse
* the collapse is borne under intrinsic constraint

From the **structural view**:

* trajectories converge
* alternatives are eliminated
* the geometry narrows

From the **experiential view**:

* resolution is owned
* inevitability is felt
* action occurs

These are not two events.

> **Agency is a projection of geometric collapse under ownership.**

---

### 4.5 History — Projection as Sedimentation

*(IER-sedimentation, IER-hysteresis)*

History persists without storage.

Each resolved constraint episode:

* hardens the geometry
* eliminates degrees of freedom
* reshapes future admissibility

This is **sedimentation**.

Nothing is retained.
The system is simply no longer able to respond as it once could.

#### Structural LEGO intuition (carefully bounded)

The LEGO metaphor is useful if interpreted structurally:

* each resolved present locks in joints
* the structure gains rigidity
* extension paths are constrained
* reversal requires breaking the structure

What accumulates is **constraint**, not blocks.
What persists is **shape**, not content.

---

### 4.6 Possibility — Projection as Open Topology

*(IER-futures, IER-saturation)*

Possibility does not mean:

* probability
* expectation
* imagined alternatives

It means:

> **physically admissible continuations under current constraint geometry.**

Admissible futures exist whether or not they are anticipated or represented.

#### Hydrocarbon intuition (trajectory-focused)

The hydrocarbon analogy captures **trajectory structure**, not storage:

* unsaturated → many local resolution pathways (slack)
* saturated → no local rearrangements remain
* further change requires regime-level reorganization

Here:

* chains ≈ trajectories through possibility space
* branching ≈ choice spaces
* saturation ≈ exhaustion of local degrees of freedom

This intuition explains **how motion through possibility space becomes constrained**, not how history is kept.

## 5. Why These Projections Feel Distinct

Each projection answers a different human question:

| Question                 | Projection  |
| ------------------------ | ----------- |
| What is happening?       | Time        |
| What do I remember?      | Memory      |
| Am I still me?           | Identity    |
| Did I choose this?       | Agency      |
| Why am I like this now?  | History     |
| What could still happen? | Possibility |

Different questions impose different coordinate systems.

Language fragments what structure unifies.

## 6. What This Synthesis Does *Not* Do

This article does **not**:

* add temporal metaphysics
* introduce geometric ontology
* license diagnostics or measurements
* permit optimization or aggregation
* privilege any projection as fundamental

All projections are explanatory conveniences.

The structure is primary.

---

## 7. Why This Article Comes *After* the Others

IER-topology is not foundational.

It becomes visible only after:

* admissible futures are defined
* memory is de-reified
* agency is de-volitionalized
* history is de-stored
* time is de-containerized

Only then does the shared geometry emerge clearly.

This is why the article functions as a **keystone**, not an entry point.

---

## 8. Summary: One Structure, Many Faces

* There is one constraint geometry
* Time is its asymmetry
* Memory is its accessibility
* Identity is its persistence
* Agency is its owned resolution
* History is its sedimentation
* Possibility is its open topology

> **Different projections.
> Same structure.
> No new machinery.**
