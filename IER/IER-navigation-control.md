# **IER-navigation-control**

## **1. Status and scope**

This article explains **how a Unified Experiential Field navigates structure** without invoking faculties, representations, retrieval, or internal controllers.

Its purpose is to make explicit a consequence already fixed by `IER-cognition.md`:
if cognition is topology reproduction under constraint, then *navigation* must consist in **continuous modulation of how traversal occurs**, not in accessing stored content or operating mental tools.

This article introduces:

* no new faculties
* no modular architecture
* no representational mechanisms

It formalizes navigation as **parameterized traversal of topology**, fully consistent with IER’s identity claim.

## **2. Why navigation needs control parameters**

If there is only one experiential regime, then cognition cannot proceed by switching subsystems on and off.

Instead, variation must arise from **how strongly**, **how widely**, and **how stably** intrinsic constraint is engaged during traversal.

Navigation therefore requires **continuous control parameters**, not discrete operations.

These parameters do not decide, observe, or select.
They **bias traversal** by shaping:

* which regions of topology are entered
* how strongly they recruit intrinsic constraint
* how easily traversal can exit or redirect

Nothing “uses” these parameters.
They are **descriptive axes** of how traversal unfolds.

## **3. Cognition knobs (descriptive, not enumerative)**

IER-cognition identifies several recurring dimensions along which traversal varies, often informally described as “knobs.”

These include, but are not limited to:

* **participation depth** — how much of the system is recruited
* **gating strength** — how strongly recruitment is limited
* **temporal anchoring** — which regions of topology are re-entered
* **attractor curvature** — how strongly traversal is pulled to remain
* **switching cost** — how difficult it is to leave a trajectory

These are **not mechanisms**.
They are **ways of describing constraint geometry under traversal**.

No knob is a controller.
No knob acts.

## **4. Raw vs cured paths**

A single admissible-future topology contains regions at different stages of fixation.

* **Raw paths** are not yet cured by traversal
* **Cured paths** are regions where irreversible settlement has occurred

Crucially:

* raw and cured paths are **the same object**
* they differ only in **whether traversal has already fixed them**

There is no separate “past structure” or “future structure.”
There is one topology with **uneven fixation**.

---

## **5. Past-thinking and future-thinking unified**

This yields the central unification:

> **Past-oriented and future-oriented cognition differ only in whether traversal occurs across cured or raw regions of the same topology.**

Thinking about the past does not retrieve stored content.
Thinking about the future does not simulate imagined states.

Both consist in:

* re-entering topology under gating
* traversing it at low participation
* respecting existing deformation

The difference is structural, not operational.

---

## **6. Rumination, planning, and imagination**

Once past- and future-thinking are unified, familiar cognitive modes collapse into variations of traversal curvature.

* **Rumination** involves high curvature around tightly cured regions
* **Planning** involves narrowing curvature across partially raw regions
* **Imagination** involves wide curvature with strong gating and low participation

Nothing new is added.
The same topology is traversed differently.

This explains why these modes:

* feel similar
* bleed into one another
* become pathological under constraint overload

---

## **7. Mood and long-horizon bias**

Mood functions as a **long-horizon bias** on navigation.

It does not inject content.
It reshapes:

* which regions feel reachable
* how costly redirection is
* how wide or narrow traversal remains

Under certain moods, raw paths appear inaccessible.
Under others, cured paths dominate traversal.

This is not belief or evaluation.
It is **topological bias under constraint**.

---

## **8. Failure modes (rigidity, looping)**

Navigation fails when control parameters become extreme or unstable.

Common failure modes include:

* **rigidity** — excessive curvature preventing redirection
* **looping** — low switching cost within narrow basins
* **collapse** — excessive participation overwhelming gating

These failures do not imply broken faculties.
They reflect **structural imbalance** within a single regime.

---

## **9. What this article does not claim**

This article does **not** claim:

* that cognition retrieves information
* that imagination simulates internal models
* that control is exercised by an agent
* that knobs can be tuned deliberately
* that navigation can be diagnosed externally

It offers **structural explanation only**.

---

## **10. Intermission**

**Orientation signal:**
*The mind does not move through time; it moves through its own topology.*

---

## **Explicit closure**

This article adds **no new structure**.

It explains **how traversal is biased** within existing structure —
how a single Unified Experiential Field navigates raw and cured paths using continuous parameters, without memory, models, or control systems.
