# 🔹 COPYPASTA — NEW CONVERSATION

## **Drafting `IER-navigation-control.md` (T2)**

---

## Article identity

* **Tier:** T2 — Cognition, participation, and control
* **Document type:** Canon-governed, non-normative explanatory article
* **Primary function:** To explain **how a Unified Experiential Field navigates structure** via continuous control parameters (“cognition knobs”) rather than faculties, representations, or retrieval

This article introduces:

* **no new faculties**
* **no modular architecture**
* **no representational mechanisms**

It formalizes navigation as **parameterized traversal of topology**.

---

## Central thesis (must appear clearly and early)

> **Thinking about the future and thinking about the past are the same structural operation applied to raw versus cured paths within the same choice topology.**

---

## Canon constraints (must not be violated)

* Do **not** describe memory as retrieval
* Do **not** describe imagination as simulation of stored content
* Do **not** multiply cognitive subsystems
* Do **not** treat knobs as agents, levers, or controllers

---

## Required conceptual alignments

Must integrate with:

* `IER-participation.md` — modulation without subsystems
* `IER-attention.md` — bias, not spotlight
* `IER-memory.md` — re-entry without storage
* `IER-futures.md` — admissible paths
* `IER-topology.md` — shared structural object

---

## Core structural commitments

* Navigation ≠ access
* Control ≠ representation
* Raw and cured paths are **the same object at different fixation stages**
* Rumination and planning differ only in curvature
* No operation “looks up” the past or future

---

## Required language anchor

> **Past-oriented and future-oriented cognition differ only in whether traversal occurs across cured or raw regions of the same topology.**

## Outline

1. Status and scope
2. Why navigation needs control parameters
3. Cognition knobs (descriptive, not enumerative)
4. Raw vs cured paths
5. Past-thinking and future-thinking unified
6. Rumination, planning, and imagination
7. Mood and long-horizon bias
8. Failure modes (rigidity, looping)
9. What this article does not claim
10. Intermission

---

## What success looks like

Readers should see:

* why memory and imagination feel identical
* why trauma collapses both past and future navigation
* why cognition does not require internal models

---

## Explicit closure

This article adds **no new structure**.

It explains **how traversal is biased** within existing structure.
