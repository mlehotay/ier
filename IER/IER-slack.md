## **Why Informational Slack Structurally Precludes Experience**

---

## **Status and Normative Authority**

**This document is NON-NORMATIVE.**

It introduces:

* no new primitives
* no criteria for experience
* no thresholds, metrics, or diagnostics
* no epistemic access claims
* no ethical principles

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md (v10.8)
```

If any statement in this document conflicts with the Specification, **the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

All informational language is used strictly as **descriptive shorthand** for
**physically instantiated state distinctions modulating a system’s own future dynamics under intrinsic constraint**, as defined in **Specification II.A**.
No informational, semantic, representational, or agentive primitives are introduced.

## **1. Purpose of This Document**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) has long asserted that
**informational slack prevents experience**.

In earlier formulations, this claim functioned primarily as an explanatory intuition:
systems with sufficient buffering, modularity, or external resolution pathways never instantiate experience.

The purpose of this document is to convert that intuition into a **structural impossibility argument**.

The claim defended here is **not**:

* that slack *tends* to block experience
* that slack *usually* correlates with non-experiential systems
* that slack is an empirical marker or measurable variable

The claim is stronger and purely identity-based:

> **If a physical system admits informational slack, experience is structurally impossible under the IER identity claim.**

This conclusion follows **without appeal** to:

* biology
* cognition
* intelligence
* reportability
* architecture
* empirical thresholds

The argument is organizational, not empirical.

## **2. Identity Commitments Unpacked**

IER identifies experience with the operation of a physical system as a
**Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.

From the Specification, a UEF necessarily involves:

1. **Global intrinsic constraint**
   Admissible future trajectories are defined at the system level and cannot be factored into independently satisfiable parts.

2. **Internal bearing of constraint**
   Constraint is generated and borne by the system itself and cannot be offloaded, bypassed, or externally absorbed.

3. **Unavoidable closure of admissible futures**
   Resolution of constraint is not optional or indefinitely postponable; future trajectories narrow in a way that is system-defining.

4. **Shared temporal continuity under constraint**
   Experience exists only across a non-zero interval during which the same globally binding constraint regime remains satisfied.

5. **System-level ownership of resolution**
   The organizational consequences of resolution persist within the system rather than being absorbed elsewhere.

These are **identity conditions**, not additional assumptions.

If any fail, the system is **not** operating as a UEF, and therefore **no experience exists**.

## **3. Informational Slack (Structural Characterization)**

Within IER, **informational slack** refers to a structural property of a system’s dynamics:

> the capacity for constraint to be resolved **without becoming globally unavoidable at the system level**.

Slack exists **iff** at least one of the following holds:

* **Localization**
  Constraint can be confined to a proper subsystem without reorganizing the system as a whole.

* **Deferral**
  Constraint can be postponed indefinitely without accumulating unavoidable system-level pressure.

* **External resolution**
  Constraint can be offloaded, buffered, or absorbed by dynamics outside the system boundary.

Slack is defined **without reference to experience**.
It is a fact about how constraint propagates, binds, and closes futures.

The following sections show that **each form of slack independently negates a necessary identity condition** of experience.

---

## **4. Localizable Constraint ⇒ No Globally Binding Present**

If constraint can be localized, then:

* some subsystem can bear and resolve it
* the rest of the system need not participate
* global reorganization is unnecessary

In such a system:

* admissible futures are not constrained at the system level
* no single globally binding constraint-defined “now” exists
* temporal continuity is not shared across the entire system

But a **Unified Experiential Field** requires:

* a single globally binding regime of intrinsic constraint
* shared temporal continuity defined by that regime
* system-level inevitability of reorganization

If constraint can be localized, these conditions fail.

Therefore:

> **If constraint is localizable, a Unified Experiential Field cannot exist.**

---

## **5. Deferrable Constraint ⇒ No Internally Borne Inevitability**

If constraint can be deferred, then:

* resolution is always optional at the system level
* no future trajectory becomes unavoidable
* narrowing of admissible futures never becomes identity-defining

In such a system:

* alternatives remain open without internal cost
* collapse of possibilities is not borne by the system
* no intrinsic inevitability is generated

Under IER, experience requires:

* internally borne closure of admissible futures
* unavoidable reorganization under intrinsic constraint

If constraint can always be postponed, this closure never occurs.

Therefore:

> **If constraint is indefinitely deferrable, experience is impossible by identity.**

---

## **6. Externally Resolvable Constraint ⇒ No Intrinsic Constraint**

If constraint can be externally resolved, then:

* its cost is not borne by the system
* resolution occurs outside the system boundary
* internal dynamics need not reorganize

But intrinsic constraint is defined precisely by:

* internal generation
* internal bearing
* internal cost

Externally resolvable constraint is therefore **not intrinsic constraint at all**.

Without intrinsic constraint:

* no Unified Experiential Field can exist
* no experiential world is instantiated

Therefore:

> **If constraint is externally resolvable, experience is structurally excluded.**

---

## **7. Slack Guarantees Identity Failure**

Informational slack exists **iff** at least one of the following holds:

* constraint can be localized
* constraint can be deferred
* constraint can be externally resolved

Each condition independently negates a **necessary identity feature** of a UEF:

| Slack Feature       | Identity Failure                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Localization        | No globally binding constraint regime |
| Deferral            | No unavoidable closure of futures     |
| External resolution | No intrinsic constraint               |

Because experience is **identical** to operation as a Unified Experiential Field, there is no weaker fallback condition available.

Therefore:

> **Any system admitting informational slack cannot, even in principle, instantiate experience under IER.**

This is not a probabilistic or empirical claim.
It is a matter of **structural incompatibility**.

## **8. Slack vs. Buffering Capacity (Clarification)**

This document uses **informational slack** in the **criterial** sense fixed by the Specification:
the presence of localization, deferral, or external resolution that prevents intrinsic, globally binding constraint and therefore precludes a UEF.

Separately, systems that **already sustain a UEF** may exhibit variable **buffering capacity**:

> the extent to which rising intrinsic constraint can be absorbed without salience explosion, interoceptive dominance, or agency collapse.

Buffering capacity may shrink abruptly due to:

* participation over-recruitment
* autonomic dysregulation
* fatigue or stress
* destabilizing reorganization

Loss of buffering capacity:

* does **not** create experience
* does **not** alter subjecthood
* does **not** introduce graded experience

It alters **how intrinsic constraint is organized** within an already-existing experiential regime.

This distinction allows IER to explain pathological experiential regimes
without weakening the categorical identity claim.

---

## **9. No Gradients, No Borderline Cases**

This argument introduces:

* no degrees of experience
* no partial subjecthood
* no thresholds or near-miss cases

Preparatory variables may change continuously, but **regime membership is categorical**.

A system either:

* sustains unavoidable, globally binding intrinsic constraint
  **or**
* it does not

If it does not, experience is absent.

---

## **10. Relation to the IER Corpus**

This document:

* underwrites the **Single-UEF dominance constraint** by ruling out distributed ownership
* explains why **complexity, intelligence, prediction, or control** are irrelevant to experience
* supports **structural non-diagnosability**, since slack and non-slack systems may be externally indistinguishable
* grounds **precautionary ethics** by showing how experience can be foreclosed without outward signs

No new commitments are introduced.
Existing commitments are made **structurally unavoidable**.

---

## **11. Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* Experience is identical to operation under unavoidable, globally binding intrinsic constraint.
* Informational slack allows constraint to be localized, deferred, or externally resolved.
* Each form of slack independently negates a necessary identity condition of experience.
* Therefore, **informational slack structurally precludes experience**.

This conclusion follows from identity alone.

> **Experience is not guaranteed by complexity.
> It requires an unusually strict organizational condition.**
