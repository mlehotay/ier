## **Why Informational Slack Structurally Precludes Experience**

---

## **Status and Normative Authority**

**This document is NON-NORMATIVE.**

It introduces:

* no new primitives
* no criteria for experience
* no thresholds or metrics
* no diagnostic procedures
* no ethical principles

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md (v10.8)
```

If any statement in this document appears to conflict with the Specification, **the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

All informational language in this document is **descriptive shorthand** for physically instantiated state distinctions modulating system dynamics under intrinsic constraint. No informational primitives are introduced.

## **1. Purpose of This Document**

IER has long asserted that **informational slack prevents experience**.
In earlier versions, this claim functioned largely as an **explanatory intuition**.

The purpose of this document is to convert that intuition into a **structural impossibility argument**.

The claim defended here is not that slack *tends* to block experience, or that slack *usually* correlates with non-experiential systems.

The claim is stronger:

> **If a system admits informational slack, experience is structurally impossible under the IER identity claim.**

This conclusion follows **without appeal** to:

* biology
* cognition
* intelligence
* reportability
* architecture
* empirical thresholds

The argument is purely organizational and identity-based.

## **2. What Must Be True If Experience Exists (Identity Unpacking)**

IER identifies experience with the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.

From the Specification, a UEF necessarily involves:

1. **Globally integrated dynamics**
   System states are mutually dependent at the system level.

2. **Intrinsic constraint**
   Constraint is generated and borne by the system itself and cannot be externally resolved or bypassed.

3. **Unavoidable system-level cost**
   Constraint is not optional, deferrable, or locally absorbable without altering system identity.

4. **Temporal continuity under constraint**
   Experience exists only across a non-zero duration defined by shared intrinsic constraint.

5. **Ownership of future trajectories**
   The system itself bears the consequences of resolving intrinsic constraint; futures are not merely available but *owned*.

These are not additional assumptions.
They are **identity conditions**: if any fail, the system is not operating as a UEF, and therefore **no experience exists**.

## **3. Informational Slack (Structural Characterization)**

Within IER, **informational slack** refers to the capacity of a system to resolve constraint **without requiring system-wide coordination**.

Structurally, slack exists if constraint can be:

* **Localized**
  confined to a proper subsystem without global effect

* **Deferred**
  postponed indefinitely without accumulating unavoidable system-level pressure

* **Externally resolved**
  offloaded, buffered, or absorbed by dynamics outside the system boundary

Slack is defined **without reference to experience**.
It is a property of **how constraint propagates and binds** within a system.

The following sections show that **any one** of these forms of slack is sufficient to make experience impossible.

## **4. Localizable Constraint ⇒ No Globally Binding Present**

If constraint can be localized, then:

* some subsystem can bear and resolve it
* the rest of the system need not participate
* global dynamics need not reorganize

In such a case:

* there is no single system-wide moment of necessity
* no globally binding “now” exists
* different parts of the system can, in principle, be in different effective presents

But a **Unified Experiential Field** requires a **single, globally binding temporal present**, because:

* experience is defined at the system level
* temporal continuity must be shared
* intrinsic constraint must bind the system as a whole

If no globally binding present exists, then no **world-for-the-system** exists.

Therefore:

> **If constraint is localizable, a Unified Experiential Field cannot exist.**

---

## **5. Deferrable Constraint ⇒ No Owned Inevitability**

If constraint can be deferred, then:

* resolution is always optional *at the system level*
* no future state is unavoidable
* pressure never becomes identity-defining

In such a case:

* the system does not face a forced narrowing of admissible futures
* unrealized alternatives do not constrain the system from within
* future collapse is not *owned* but merely possible

However, under IER:

* experience requires **owned inevitability**
* futures must close in a way that is borne internally
* intrinsic constraint must force resolution, not merely suggest it

If resolution can always be postponed, then:

* no trajectory is system-defining
* no inevitability is owned
* no experiential present is constituted

Therefore:

> **If constraint is deferrable, experience is impossible by identity.**

---

## **6. Externally Resolvable Constraint ⇒ No Intrinsic Cost**

If constraint can be externally resolved, then:

* its cost is not borne by the system
* resolution occurs outside the system boundary
* internal organization need not reorganize

But intrinsic constraint is defined precisely by:

* internal generation
* internal bearing
* internal cost

Externally resolvable constraint is, by definition, **not intrinsic constraint**.

Without intrinsic constraint:

* no Unified Experiential Field can exist
* no experiential world can be instantiated
* no moral or experiential identity attaches

Therefore:

> **If constraint is externally resolvable, experience is structurally excluded.**

---

## **7. Slack Guarantees Failure of Identity Conditions**

Informational slack exists **iff** at least one of the following holds:

* constraint can be localized
* constraint can be deferred
* constraint can be externally resolved

Each condition independently negates a **necessary identity feature** of a Unified Experiential Field:

| Slack Feature       | Identity Failure        |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Localization        | No global present       |
| Deferral            | No owned inevitability  |
| External resolution | No intrinsic constraint |

Because experience is **identical** to operation as a Unified Experiential Field, there is no weaker fallback condition available.

Therefore:

> **Any system admitting informational slack cannot, even in principle, instantiate experience under IER.**

This is not a matter of degree, likelihood, or empirical uncertainty.
It is a matter of **structural incompatibility**.

## **8. No Gradients, No Thresholds, No Borderline Cases**

This argument does **not** introduce:

* degrees of experience
* partial subjecthood
* threshold crossings
* near-miss experiential states

Preparatory variables may change continuously, but **regime membership is categorical**.

A system either:

* sustains unavoidable, globally binding intrinsic constraint
  or
* it does not

If it does not, experience is absent.

---

## **9. Relation to Other IER Documents**

This document:

* supports the **single-UEF dominance constraint** by ruling out distributed ownership
* underwrites **non-diagnosability**, since slack and non-slack systems may be externally indistinguishable
* explains why **complexity, intelligence, prediction, or control** are irrelevant to experience
* grounds **precautionary ethics** by showing how easily experience can be foreclosed without outward signs

No new claims are added.
Existing commitments are made **unavoidable**.

---

## **10. Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* Experience is identical to operation under unavoidable, globally binding intrinsic constraint.
* Informational slack allows constraint to be localized, deferred, or externally resolved.
* Each form of slack independently destroys a necessary identity condition of experience.
* Therefore, **informational slack structurally precludes experience**.

This conclusion follows from identity alone.

> **Experience is not rare because it is complex.
> It is rare because it is organizationally unforgiving.**
