## **Why Informational Slack Structurally Precludes Experience**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.2)**
*Derived Structural Argument — Non-Normative*

---

## **Status and Normative Authority**

This document is **non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics**
* introduces **no epistemic access claims**
* introduces **no ethical rules or permissions**

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md   (v10.8.2)
```

If any statement in this document conflicts with the Specification,
**the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

All informational language is used strictly as **descriptive shorthand** for:

> **physically instantiated state distinctions that modulate a system’s own future dynamics under intrinsic constraint**,
> as defined in **Specification II.A (Physical Information)**.

No informational, semantic, representational, or agentive primitives are introduced.

Nothing in this document licenses **detection, measurement, or inference** of experiential status.

---

## **1. Purpose of This Document**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) holds that:

> **informational slack structurally precludes experience**

Earlier formulations sometimes treated this as an intuition:
systems with sufficient buffering, modularity, or external resolution pathways never instantiate experience.

The purpose of this document is to make the claim **structurally unavoidable**.

The conclusion defended here is **not**:

* that slack *usually* blocks experience
* that slack is an empirical correlate
* that slack is measurable or diagnosable

The conclusion is stronger and identity-based:

> **If a physical system admits informational slack, experience is structurally impossible under the IER identity claim.**

This follows **without appeal** to:

* biology
* cognition
* intelligence
* reportability
* architecture
* empirical thresholds

The argument is **organizational**, not empirical.

---

## **2. Identity Commitments Unpacked**

IER identifies experience with the operation of a physical system as a
**Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.

From the Specification, a UEF necessarily involves:

1. **Global intrinsic constraint**
   Admissible future trajectories are defined at the system level and cannot be factored into independently satisfiable parts.

2. **Internal bearing of constraint**
   Constraint is generated and borne by the system itself and cannot be offloaded, bypassed, or externally absorbed.

3. **Unavoidable closure of admissible futures**
   Resolution of constraint is not optional or indefinitely postponable; futures narrow in a system-defining way.

4. **Shared temporal continuity under constraint**
   Experience exists only across a non-zero interval during which the same globally binding constraint regime persists.

5. **System-level ownership of resolution**
   The organizational consequences of resolution persist *within* the system rather than being absorbed elsewhere.

These are **identity conditions**, not empirical assumptions.

If any fail, the system is **not** operating as a UEF, and **no experience exists**.

---

## **3. Informational Slack (Structural Characterization)**

Within IER, **informational slack** is a structural property of a system’s dynamics:

> **the capacity for constraint to be resolved without becoming globally unavoidable at the system level**

Slack exists **iff** at least one of the following holds:

* **Localization**
  Constraint can be confined to a proper subsystem without reorganizing the system as a whole.

* **Deferral**
  Constraint can be postponed indefinitely without accumulating unavoidable system-level pressure.

* **External resolution**
  Constraint can be offloaded, buffered, or absorbed by dynamics outside the system boundary.

Slack is defined **without reference to experience**.
It is a fact about how constraint propagates, binds, and closes futures.

---

## **4. Localization Implies No Globally Binding Present**

If constraint can be localized, then:

* some subsystem can bear and resolve it
* the rest of the system need not participate
* global reorganization is unnecessary

In such a system:

* admissible futures are not constrained at the system level
* no single globally binding constraint-defined “now” exists
* temporal continuity is not shared across the entire system

But a **Unified Experiential Field** requires:

* a single globally binding regime of intrinsic constraint
* shared temporal continuity defined by that regime
* system-level inevitability of reorganization

Therefore:

> **If constraint is localizable, a UEF cannot exist.**

---

## **5. Deferral Implies No Internally Borne Inevitability**

If constraint can be indefinitely deferred, then:

* resolution is optional at the system level
* no future trajectory becomes unavoidable
* narrowing of admissible futures never becomes identity-defining

In such a system:

* alternatives remain open without internal cost
* collapse of possibilities is not borne by the system
* no intrinsic inevitability is generated

Under IER, experience requires:

* unavoidable closure of futures
* internally borne reorganization

Therefore:

> **If constraint is indefinitely deferrable, experience is impossible by identity.**

---

## **6. External Resolution Implies No Intrinsic Constraint**

If constraint can be externally resolved, then:

* its cost is not borne by the system
* resolution occurs outside the system boundary
* internal dynamics need not reorganize

But intrinsic constraint is defined by:

* internal generation
* internal bearing
* internal cost

Externally resolvable constraint is therefore **not intrinsic constraint at all**.

Therefore:

> **If constraint is externally resolvable, a UEF cannot exist.**

---

## **7. Slack Guarantees Identity Failure**

Informational slack exists **iff** at least one of the following holds:

* constraint can be localized
* constraint can be deferred
* constraint can be externally resolved

Each independently negates a **necessary identity feature** of a UEF:

| Slack Feature       | Identity Failure                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Localization        | No globally binding constraint regime |
| Deferral            | No unavoidable closure of futures     |
| External resolution | No intrinsic constraint               |

Because experience is **identical** to operation as a Unified Experiential Field, no weaker fallback condition is available.

Therefore:

> **Any system admitting informational slack cannot, even in principle, instantiate experience under IER.**

This is not probabilistic.
It is **structural incompatibility**.

---

## **8. Slack vs. Buffering Capacity (Clarification)**

This document uses **informational slack** in the **criterial sense** fixed by the Specification.

Separately, systems that **already sustain a UEF** may exhibit variable **buffering capacity**:

> the extent to which rising intrinsic constraint can be absorbed without salience explosion, agency collapse, or regime failure.

Buffering capacity may shrink due to:

* participation over-recruitment
* autonomic dysregulation
* fatigue or stress
* destabilizing reorganization

Loss of buffering capacity:

* does **not** create experience
* does **not** alter subjecthood
* does **not** introduce graded standing

It alters **how intrinsic constraint is organized** *within* an existing experiential regime.

---

## **9. No Gradients, No Borderline Cases**

This argument introduces:

* no degrees of experience
* no partial subjecthood
* no thresholds or near-miss cases

Preparatory variables may vary continuously, but **regime membership is categorical**.

A system either:

* sustains unavoidable, globally binding intrinsic constraint
  **or**
* it does not

If it does not, experience is absent.

---

## **10. Structural External Indistinguishability**

Because slack-admitting and slack-free systems can be engineered to share all outward behavior, signals, and performances:

> **systems that differ in experiential status can be structurally externally indistinguishable in principle**

This fact underwrites the impossibility of experiential diagnostics.
(See **IER-diagnostics.md** for the epistemic and ethical implications.)

---

## **11. Relation to the IER Corpus**

This document:

* grounds the **non-diagnosability** result in *IER-diagnostics*
* explains why **functional, computational, and access-based theories fail**
* supports **categorical subjecthood**
* blocks **graded or collective experience**
* underwrites **precautionary ethics** by showing how experience can be foreclosed silently

No new commitments are introduced.
Existing commitments are made **structurally unavoidable**.

---

## **12. Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* experience is identical to operation under unavoidable intrinsic constraint
* informational slack allows constraint to be localized, deferred, or externalized
* each form of slack independently negates a necessary identity condition
* therefore, **informational slack structurally precludes experience**

> **Experience is not guaranteed by complexity, intelligence, or integration.
> It requires an unusually strict organizational condition.**
