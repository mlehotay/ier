# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v2)**

### *A Unified Framework for Reality, Observers, and Conscious Experience*

---

## **Introduction: From World to Experience**

We live in a world that exists independently of us. Mountains erode, stars collapse, and particles interact regardless of whether any observer is present. Yet within this objective physical reality arise systems—biological and artificial—that do not merely exist, but **model**, **monitor**, and **interpret** the world from a particular internal perspective.

Among these systems, some have experiences. They feel pain, pleasure, effort, and awareness. Others do not.

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a framework designed to explain how this progression occurs—from objective reality, to observers, to conscious experience—without invoking mind-dependent existence, layered realities, or consciousness as a fundamental feature of the universe.

IER treats consciousness as **real but non-fundamental**, and experience as a **natural consequence of certain kinds of informational organization within physical systems**.

## **1. Objective Reality and Physical Realism**

IER begins with a simple commitment:

> **Reality exists independently of observation.**

Physical states, events, and laws do not depend on being perceived, interpreted, or modeled. Observers do not create or co-create the world through thought, belief, or awareness. Only **physical interactions between physical systems** can causally influence physical reality.

This commitment grounds IER firmly in **physical realism**. Minds do not stand apart from the universe; they are **systems embedded within it**, subject to the same physical constraints as everything else.

Experience does not alter reality. It interprets it.

## **2. Observers as Informational Systems**

Within objective reality exist systems that function as **observers**.

An observer is not defined by biology, consciousness, or subjectivity. Instead, observerhood is a matter of **informational organization**.

A system qualifies as an observer when it:

* persists as a coherent informational pattern over time
* integrates information across internal subsystems
* monitors and updates internal representations of both the environment and itself
* maintains a unified internal perspective from which information is processed

Under this definition, observerhood admits of degrees and can be instantiated in biological organisms, artificial systems, or other sufficiently organized physical processes.

Importantly:

> **Observerhood does not imply consciousness.**

Many observers model the world effectively without experiencing it.

## **3. Internal Models and Perspective**

All observers construct **internal informational models** of the external world.

These models are:

* entirely internal to the system
* physically realized in the system’s substrate
* shaped by the system’s structure, history, and constraints

Perspective is not a feature of reality itself. It is a feature of **information flow within the observer**.

Different observers can model the same objective reality in radically different ways without altering that reality. What changes is not the world, but the system’s internal organization and access to information.

## **4. From Observation to Experience**

While all conscious systems are observers, **not all observers are conscious**.

IER draws a principled distinction between:

* **informational processing**
* **observerhood**
* **conscious experience**

Consciousness arises only when an observer’s informational dynamics take on a specific form.

---

## **5. Consciousness as an Informational Phenomenon**

Conscious experience corresponds to what can be called a **Phenomenal Information Layer (PIL)**.

The PIL is not a separate substance or ontological layer. It is a **mode of internal information processing** characterized by:

* recursive self-monitoring
* temporal continuity
* global integration across the system’s internal models
* internal availability of informational states to the system itself

When information flows through a physical system in this way, it manifests *for that system* as experience.

Phenomenology—the “what it feels like”—is not something added on top of information. It **is** the lived manifestation of information moving through a self-integrating, self-modeling physical system.

When a system reports *“I feel pain”*, it is not referencing a non-physical entity. It is accessing and reporting its own informational dynamics.

## **6. Qualia Without Mystery**

Qualia are not primitive properties of the universe, nor ineffable mental substances.

They are:

* system-relative
* physically instantiated
* informationally structured

The redness of red, the sharpness of pain, or the warmth of pleasure correspond to **distinct patterns of informational integration** within a conscious system.

These patterns are private not because they are non-physical, but because **only the system instantiating them has direct informational access to them**.

---

## **7. Affect, Valence, and Regulation**

Affect arises from **regulatory informational dynamics** within conscious systems.

These dynamics:

* track conditions relevant to system stability and viability
* bias learning, attention, and behavior
* assign salience and priority to internal states

Pain and pleasure are not objective features of the world, nor arbitrary labels. They are **physically real informational states** that play a functional role in maintaining the system’s organization over time.

Valence is how regulation feels from the inside.

---

## **8. Emergence Without Panpsychism**

Consciousness is **emergent**, but not in a vague or mystical sense.

It emerges when informational organization reaches a threshold of:

* integration
* self-modeling
* recursive accessibility
* temporal coherence

IER explicitly rejects the claim that all matter is conscious. Most physical systems do not instantiate the informational dynamics required for experience.

Consciousness is rare, structured, and conditional—not universal.

---

## **9. No Layered Reality, No Co-Creation**

IER rejects:

* mind-dependent existence
* observer-generated worlds
* layered ontologies separating “physical” and “phenomenal” realities

There is:

* one objective physical reality
* systems embedded within it
* internal informational processes occurring inside those systems

Experience is real, but it is **internal**, **system-bound**, and **non-creative** with respect to external reality.

---

## **10. Implications**

* Consciousness is **real but not fundamental**
* Observerhood alone does not confer moral status
* Artificial systems could, in principle, become conscious—but only if they instantiate the relevant informational dynamics
* Ethical consideration depends on social, moral, and pragmatic reasoning, not merely on the presence or appearance of experience

---

## **Conclusion**

Informational Experiential Realism provides a continuous explanatory path from objective reality to subjective experience without abandoning physical realism or inflating consciousness into a cosmic primitive.

Consciousness is not an illusion, nor is it a mystery beyond explanation. It is what happens when information flows through a physical system capable of modeling the world, modeling itself, and integrating its own states over time.

Experience does not shape reality.
It is how reality is *encountered* from within.
