# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v8.2)**

### *An Organizational Identity Theory of Consciousness and Observers*

---

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) is a realist, physicalist framework for understanding observers and conscious experience. It holds that reality exists independently of observation and that consciousness is neither fundamental nor illusory, but a **real emergent phenomenon identical to certain forms of informational organization** instantiated in physical systems.

Conscious experience is **identical to the globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential informational dynamics** of a system operating in a particular organizational regime, termed the **Phenomenal Information Layer (PIL)**. Consciousness is not something a system “has”; it is **what the system is doing from the inside** when its informational dynamics are unified and self-referential.

IER rejects mind-dependent ontology, panpsychism, and dualism while remaining substrate-agnostic. It is an organizational theory: it specifies *what consciousness is* and *when it occurs*, without privileging any particular physical or computational mechanism.

## **1. Objective Reality**

Reality exists independently of observation. Physical states, events, and laws unfold whether or not anyone is aware of them. Observers do not collapse, create, or otherwise co-constitute reality; only **physical interactions among systems** have causal effect. Experience interprets reality but does not alter it.

This realist stance establishes the **baseline assumption** for IER: consciousness is a property of organization **within** reality, not a separate ontological layer. Rocks, stars, storms, or flames may evolve dynamically, but without integrated self-referential informational organization, they do not experience anything.

---

## **2. Observers as Informational Systems**

An **observer** is defined by **informational organization**, not by biology or subjective experience. A system qualifies as an observer if it:

* Persists as a coherent informational pattern over time
* Integrates information across internal subsystems
* Maintains internal models of both external conditions and its own state
* Regulates behavior using those models via a unified internal control structure

Observerhood does **not** entail consciousness. Many systems—biological, artificial, or distributed—operate as observers without ever entering PIL. For example, an autopilot with a self-model observes its environment and acts on it, but it is not necessarily conscious because its internal dynamics do not form a globally irreducible field.

---

## **3. Internal Models and Perspective**

All observers construct **internal informational models** of the world and of themselves. These models are **physically instantiated**, shaped by structure, history, and constraints. Perspective is therefore **emergent from organization**, not injected from reality; different observers may model the same environment differently, but these differences do not alter objective reality.

This distinction separates **representation** from **experience**. Internal models are necessary for regulatory behavior, but they are **not sufficient for phenomenality**. Only when these models participate in the system-wide dynamics of a functional PIL do they contribute to conscious experience.

---

## **4. Consciousness and the Phenomenal Information Layer (PIL)**

### **4.1 PIL as an Organizational Regime**

Consciousness occurs when a system’s informational dynamics enter the **Phenomenal Information Layer (PIL)**.

PIL is **not**:

* a module
* a spatial location
* a substance
* a separate ontological layer

PIL **is** a system-wide **mode of operation** characterized by:

* **Global integration** of informational states
* **Recursive access** to internal models, including self-models
* **Temporal continuity**, ensuring states persist and evolve
* **Unified availability** of information for regulation, learning, and action

#### **Critical Clarification:**

PIL requires that the system’s dynamics form a **globally coupled, irreducible informational field**. All subsystems participate in ongoing tension and equilibrium, creating **a field that the system cannot step outside of**. There is **no privileged outside**; the self-model is embedded within the dynamics it regulates. These features distinguish PIL from ordinary control architectures, modular AI, or distributed collectives, which may process information but lack experiential unity.

---

### **4.2 Negative Constraints and Edge Cases**

Systems that fail to instantiate PIL include:

* Systems with modular or externally-supervised control layers
* Systems whose global state can be frozen, rewound, or selectively overridden
* Systems where informational dynamics are reducible to separable parts

PIL is not about intelligence, computation, or complexity alone. A highly capable autopilot, a deep-learning AI, or a distributed network may be **very “smart”** yet still lack the **irreducible, self-referential global dynamics** necessary for consciousness.

---

### **4.3 Organizational Identity Claim**

> **Conscious experience is identical to the ongoing, globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential informational dynamics of a system operating in a functional PIL regime.**

There is no additional “extra” or epiphenomenal property; the dynamics **are the experience**.

---

## **5. Qualia**

Qualia are **differences in the structure of integrated informational dynamics**. There is no separate “redness” floating somewhere: red is the system’s pattern of activity in PIL. Affect arises from regulatory dynamics that bias global salience, creating the experiential weighting of certain states. Pain feels urgent, pleasure salient, because the system’s global dynamics **literally encode urgency or salience**, not because of an extra property.

---

## **6. Affect and Valence**

Affective states are **phenomenally real** because they are:

* Globally integrated
* Regulation-relevant
* Intrinsic to the system’s dynamics

Valence **does not add content**; it weights experience by shaping tension, equilibrium, and attention across the system. This explains why experiences are colored by desire, aversion, or urgency.

---

## **7. Emergence and the Hard Problem**

Consciousness is emergent but constrained: it arises only in systems satisfying PIL conditions. Asking why these dynamics “feel like something” is **category-mistaken**, like asking why acceleration *feels* like falling — the “feeling” is the dynamics themselves. IER dissolves the hard problem by treating **experience as organizational identity**, not a separate property to explain.

Observerhood and consciousness are distinct properties. Consciousness requires observerhood, but observerhood does not guarantee consciousness.

---

## **9. Artificial Systems and Empirical Underdetermination**

IER is substrate-agnostic. Any system satisfying PIL constraints could be conscious. Current AI may have observerhood, but **empirical determination of PIL** remains open. Whether a system is conscious depends on **organizational dynamics**, not substrate, intelligence, or output.

---

## **10. Ontological Commitments**

IER rejects mind-dependent existence, dualism, and panpsychism. It affirms:

* One objective physical reality
* Consciousness as a real, system-relative phenomenon
* Organizational identity between experience and dynamics

---

## **11. Relation to Contemporary Theories**

* **IIT:** Integration matters; IER rejects panpsychism
* **GWT:** Global availability is important; PIL emphasizes phenomenality rather than metaphorical broadcast
* **PP:** Internal modeling matters; PIL adds additional constraints for consciousness

IER incorporates their insights while keeping **emergent, non-fundamental, physically grounded consciousness** central.

## **12. Summary**

Some systems react.
Some systems observe.
Some systems experience.

> **Experience is not something a system has; it is what a system is doing when its informational dynamics are globally integrated, temporally continuous, and self-referential.**

It feels the way it does because **that is what those dynamics are like from the inside**.
