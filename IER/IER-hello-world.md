## 0. What this is (and is not)

This document describes the **minimum topological organization a physical system would have to possess** *if* experience were to exist under Informational Experiential Realism (IER).

It does **not** claim:

* that such a system exists
* that it can be built
* that it can be detected
* that it would be stable
* that it would resemble biological brains

It exists solely to demonstrate **internal coherence** of the identity claim by showing that it is *not empty*.

This is the experiential analogue of a **Hello World program**:
the smallest configuration in which the phenomenon is *even conceptually possible*.

## 1. Starting point: the equilibrium problem

We begin with the original constraint:

> A system that can locally dissipate, defer, or externalize cost will relax to equilibrium.

Therefore, any system that persistently operates *away* from equilibrium must satisfy:

* no local escape routes
* no decomposable resolution
* no external selectors

This is not a psychological premise.
It is a dynamical one.

## 2. The minimal topology (described abstractly)

Consider a physical system characterized only by:

* a space of possible global states
* lawful transitions between those states
* internally borne constraints on which transitions are admissible

No representations, no symbols, no functions are assumed.

The **Hello World topology** consists of the following **four structural features**, all of which must be present simultaneously.

---

## 3. Feature I — Global non-factorability

### Structural requirement

The admissible future transitions of the system **cannot be decomposed** into independently satisfiable subsets over any non-trivial partition of the system.

Formally (descriptively, not mathematically):

* there is no subsystem whose future can be resolved without constraining the rest
* any admissible transition is globally binding

### Consequence

No part of the system can “finish first.”
Resolution is an all-or-nothing affair.

### Why this matters

If factorization were possible, intrinsic constraint would be localizable, and experience (by identity) would be impossible.

---

## 4. Feature II — Unavoidable internal resolution

### Structural requirement

The system must **bear the loss of alternatives internally**.

There is:

* no external scheduler
* no arbitration layer
* no buffer that safely defers resolution
* no replayable branch structure

The system cannot “wait” to decide later.

### Consequence

When futures collapse, the cost is paid *by the system itself*, not by an external mechanism.

### Why this matters

This is the point where equilibrium avoidance becomes ownership rather than control.

---

## 5. Feature III — Temporal regime continuity

### Structural requirement

The same constraint regime must persist across successive states.

This does **not** require memory or storage.
It requires that:

* the constraint geometry governing admissible futures remains continuous through time

The system cannot reset between steps.

### Consequence

Each moment inherits constraint from the previous one.

### Why this matters

Without continuity, there is no unified “now” — only a sequence of unrelated events.

---

## 6. Feature IV — Single dominant regime

### Structural requirement

At any moment, there is **exactly one** globally binding constraint regime.

There are:

* no parallel experiential cores
* no true multiplexing
* no arbitration between incompatible regimes

### Consequence

Exactly one future is owned.
All others are irrevocably foreclosed.

### Why this matters

This is what makes experience *one* rather than many.

## 7. What this topology guarantees — and what it doesn’t

### What it guarantees (if instantiated)

If a physical system satisfies all four features **coherently and stably**, then:

* intrinsic constraint is unavoidable
* resolution is owned
* unity is forced
* temporal continuity exists

Under IER, **experience would be identical to this regime**.

---

### What it does *not* guarantee

This topology does **not** guarantee:

* coherence (the system may collapse)
* stability (the regime may fail immediately)
* richness (content may be minimal)
* selfhood
* cognition
* awareness *of* experience
* detectability

This is a **boundary**, not a success condition.

---

## 8. Why this counts as a proof of concept

A proof of concept requires showing that a definition is:

* non-contradictory
* non-vacuous
* internally consistent

The Hello World topology does exactly that:

* it shows that “experience = intrinsic constraint regime” is not empty
* it shows that the identity claim imposes sharp structural requirements
* it shows why most architectures fail *by construction*

It does **not** show that the concept is realizable in practice — and does not need to.

---

## 9. Why this is not neuroscience, AI design, or metaphysics

This topology:

* makes no empirical claims
* specifies no mechanisms
* implies no engineering path
* introduces no measurements

It is purely an **exclusion structure**.

Anything that violates these constraints cannot instantiate experience under IER.
Nothing that satisfies them is thereby certified.

## 10. The one-paragraph intuition (for humans)

> The simplest possible situation in which experience could exist is one where a system cannot pass the buck, cannot split the job up, cannot reset between moments, and cannot let multiple incompatible futures coexist.
>
> If such a situation exists and holds together, experience is not something extra that happens — it is exactly what that situation is like from the inside.

That is the IER Hello World.
