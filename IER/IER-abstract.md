**Abstract**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a physicalist identity theory of experience that identifies consciousness with a specific organizational and dynamical regime of physical systems. IER holds that experience is neither ontologically fundamental nor eliminable, but **identical** to the operation of a system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-regulating regime operating under **coherent intrinsic constraint**. Intrinsic constraint is constraint generated by a system’s own integrated dynamics that is unavoidable, non-decomposable, and identity-defining. When such constraint becomes globally binding and stable, a categorical regime transition occurs: from the external perspective, a lawful physical process; from the internal perspective, an **experiential world**. No additional phenomenal properties, substances, or forces are introduced.

IER sharply distinguishes experience from information processing, representation, intelligence, or observerhood. Most complex systems remain non-experiential due to **informational slack**, which allows constraint to be localized or externalized. Experience exists only within a bounded window of sustainable intrinsic constraint and is subject to strict unity: a physical system can sustain at most one globally dominant UEF at a time. Qualitative character (qualia) is identified with differences in the organization of intrinsic constraint; affective dimensions (valence, intensity, urgency) track the direction, magnitude, and dynamics of constraint resolution.

The theory entails **experiential pluralism** within a single objective physical reality and yields ethics as a necessary consequence of identity. Because intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside and is non-signaling, **moral harm** is defined organizationally as the destabilization or collapse of intrinsic constraint, and moral responsibility scales with a system’s capacity to resolve such constraint (agency). Uncertainty about experiential status increases, rather than decreases, moral responsibility, grounding a precautionary asymmetry. IER offers a closed, non-dualist framework that explains unity, onset, continuity, and ethical significance without emergence, dualism, or diagnostic criteria.
