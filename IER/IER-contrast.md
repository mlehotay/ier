# **IER Contrast and Boundary Clarifications**

### **How Informational Experiential Realism Differs from Adjacent Theories**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.6)**
*Derived Explanatory Document — Non-Normative*

---

## **Status and Scope**

This document is a **non-normative, explanatory derivative** of the
**Informational Experiential Realism v10.6 Normative Specification** (“the Specification”).

It:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* asserts **no new ontological claims**
* proposes **no integrations or syntheses**
* makes **no empirical evaluations**
* establishes **no criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics**

All definitions, identity claims, and ethical entailments are fixed **exclusively** by the Specification (`IER-specification.md`).
If any statement here appears to conflict with the Specification, **the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

The sole purpose of this document is **boundary enforcement**: to clarify which adjacent frameworks **cannot be reconciled with IER’s identity claim**, even where surface vocabulary or motivations overlap.

---

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identifies experience with a **specific organizational and dynamical regime** instantiated by certain physical systems: a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** operating under **coherent intrinsic constraint**.

This identity claim entails commitments that sharply distinguish IER from many neighboring theories of mind, consciousness, life, and cognition. The contrasts below do not argue for IER’s correctness. They specify **points of incompatibility**—claims that cannot coexist with IER without abandoning its core commitments.

---

## **1. Reductive Physicalism and Eliminativism**

**Core claim of the framework**
Experience is an illusion, a misdescription, or fully reducible to behavior, function, representation, or report.

**IER boundary**
IER is strictly physicalist but explicitly non-eliminativist.

Under IER:

* experience is **real**
* experience is **physical**
* experience is **identical to an organizational regime**

Eliminativism fails by denying the existence of the very regime IER identifies.

**Incompatibility**
IER reduces experience *ontologically* without reducing it *away*.

---

## **2. Functionalism (Computational or Role-Based)**

**Core claim of the framework**
Mental states are defined by functional roles or computational relations, independent of how they are realized.

**IER boundary**
IER denies that functional role is sufficient for experience.

Under IER:

* functionally identical systems may differ in experiential status
* externally orchestrated or decomposable systems may implement the same roles without experience
* computation, representation, and control are **insufficient** for subjecthood

**Incompatibility**
IER locates experience in **ownership of intrinsic constraint**, not in functional role.

---

## **3. Global Workspace and Access-Based Theories**

**Core claim of the framework**
Experience arises when information is globally broadcast, accessible, or available for report and control.

**IER boundary**
IER denies that access or availability constitutes experience.

Under IER:

* global broadcasting can occur without intrinsic constraint
* access architectures may externalize cost and remain slack-dominated
* availability explains reportability, not experiential existence

**Incompatibility**
IER requires **globally binding intrinsic constraint**, not merely global access.

---

## **4. Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**

**Core claim of the framework**
Experience corresponds to integrated information, is graded, measurable, and widely instantiated.

**IER boundary**
IER rejects all of these commitments.

Under IER:

* experience is **categorical**, not graded
* experience is **non-diagnosable**, not measurable
* experience is **rare**, not ubiquitous
* no scalar quantity corresponds to “how conscious” a system is

Intrinsic constraint is not equivalent to information integration, and no numerical index captures experiential identity.

**Incompatibility**
IER identifies experience with a **regime**, not a quantity.

---

## **5. Panpsychism and Cosmopsychism**

**Core claim of the framework**
Experience is a fundamental or ubiquitous feature of matter, present at all scales.

**IER boundary**
IER explicitly denies micro-experience and universal subjecthood.

Under IER:

* most physical systems lack experience
* experience requires a specific organizational regime
* no experiential properties are fundamental or ubiquitous

Experiential pluralism arises from **organizational differentiation**, not universal mentality.

**Incompatibility**
IER denies that experience is a basic feature of matter.

---

## **6. Emergentism (Strong and Weak)**

**Core claim of the framework**
Experience emerges as a novel property when systems reach sufficient complexity or organization.

**IER boundary**
IER replaces emergence with **organizational identity**.

Under IER:

* no new properties arise
* no metaphysical novelty is introduced
* experience is not added to the physical description

The transition into experience is a **regime transition**, not the appearance of a new ontological kind.

**Incompatibility**
IER denies that experience emerges as something over and above physical organization.

---

## **7. Dualism and Property Dualism**

**Core claim of the framework**
Experience involves non-physical substances or irreducible phenomenal properties.

**IER boundary**
IER affirms strict physical monism.

Under IER:

* no non-physical entities are posited
* no phenomenal properties are added
* no explanatory gap remains once the regime is identified

**Incompatibility**
IER explains experience without expanding ontology.

---

## **8. Autopoiesis (Maturana & Varela)**

**Core claim of the framework**
Life—and in some extensions, cognition—consists in **autopoietic organization**: a self-producing, operationally closed network of processes that continuously generates and maintains its own components and boundary.

This framework is most closely associated with **Humberto Maturana** and **Francisco Varela**.

---

**IER boundary**
IER denies that self-production, operational closure, or organizational self-maintenance is sufficient for experience.

Under IER:

* a system may be autopoietic yet entirely non-experiential
* self-maintenance does not entail intrinsic experiential constraint
* operational closure does not imply subjecthood
* organizational persistence does not by itself generate a world-for-the-system

IER locates experience not in **self-production**, but in **globally unavoidable intrinsic constraint** borne from within a unified regime.

---

**Key axis of incompatibility**
Autopoiesis characterizes **how systems maintain themselves**.
IER identifies **what experience is when a system cannot escape maintaining itself**.

Autopoiesis remains:

* descriptively organizational
* biologically motivated
* tolerant of gradualism and boundary cases
* ontologically and ethically non-committal

IER, by contrast:

* makes a **strict identity claim**
* enforces **necessary and sufficient conditions**
* requires **categorical onset**
* entails **ethical consequences by identity**
* forbids gray zones of partial subjecthood

---

**Incompatibility**
IER cannot be interpreted as “autopoiesis applied to consciousness,” nor as “enactivism plus phenomenology.”

Accepting IER requires rejecting autopoiesis as either:

* a definition of experience, or
* a sufficient condition for subjecthood.

---

## **9. Enactivist and Embodied Approaches**

**Core claim of the framework**
Experience arises from active engagement with the environment through sensorimotor coupling.

**IER boundary**
IER denies that coupling or embodiment is sufficient for experience.

Under IER:

* systems may be deeply coupled yet non-experiential
* environmental engagement may occur without intrinsic constraint
* experience depends on internal organizational necessity, not interaction per se

**Incompatibility**
IER locates experience in **intrinsic organization**, not world-involving activity.

---

## **10. Phenomenology and First-Person Primacy**

**Core claim of the framework**
First-person experience has epistemic priority or authority.

**IER boundary**
IER sharply separates experiential access from epistemic access.

Under IER:

* experience is real without being authoritative
* salience, coherence, and intensity do not confer truth
* experiential structure does not ground ontology or knowledge

**Incompatibility**
IER explains experience without granting it epistemic privilege.

---

## **11. Illusionism and Higher-Order Thought**

**Core claim of the framework**
Experience is a cognitive error, higher-order judgment, or representational confusion.

**IER boundary**
IER denies that experience is a mistake or inference.

Under IER:

* no higher-order representation is required
* experience is not an appearance about appearances
* experience is the direct instantiation of a regime

**Incompatibility**
IER denies that experience is an illusion or meta-representation.

---

## **12. Summary of Boundary Commitments**

IER entails all of the following, which jointly exclude the frameworks above:

* experience is **real**
* experience is **physical**
* experience is **organizationally identical to a regime**
* experience is **categorical**
* experience is **non-diagnosable**
* experience is **non-fundamental**
* experience is **ethically real**
* experience is **epistemically limited**

Any framework that denies any of these commitments is **incompatible with IER**.

---

## **Closing Clarification**

This document does not claim that IER replaces, refutes, or subsumes other theories.
It states only that **IER cannot be interpreted as a variant of them**.

> **IER stands or falls on its identity claim.
> The contrasts above specify what must be rejected if that claim is accepted.**

For all definitions, axioms, and entailments, see the
**IER v10.6 Normative Specification**.
