### **How Informational Experiential Realism Differs from Adjacent Frameworks**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.3)**
*Derived Explanatory Document — Non-Normative*

---

## **Status and Scope**

This document is a **non-normative, explanatory derivative** of:

```
IER-specification.md   (v10.8.2)
```

It:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* asserts **no new ontological claims**
* proposes **no integrations, syntheses, or hybrids**
* makes **no empirical or evaluative judgments**
* establishes **no criteria, thresholds, diagnostics, or tests**

All definitions, identity claims, regime conditions, epistemic limits, and ethical entailments are fixed **exclusively** by the Specification.
If any statement in this document conflicts with the Specification, **the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

The sole purpose of this document is **boundary clarification**:
to make explicit which neighboring frameworks **cannot be reconciled with IER’s identity claim**, even where vocabulary, motivations, or descriptive interests overlap.

This document does **not** argue that those frameworks are false.
It specifies only **incompatibility of commitments**.

---

## **Orientation for the Reader**

IER shares language with many contemporary theories—*information, integration, dynamics, constraint, unity*—because those theories also describe real organizational features of physical systems.

Vocabulary overlap does **not** imply theoretical compatibility.

IER’s central commitment is unusually narrow and unusually strict:

> **Experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a Unified Experiential Field (UEF), defined by globally unavoidable intrinsic constraint.**

Many frameworks describe important phenomena while relaxing, bypassing, or redefining at least one part of that claim.
This document maps those fault lines so readers do not mistake proximity for equivalence.

---

## **Global Informational Language Disclaimer**

All uses of *information*, *integration*, *coherence*, *constraint*, *architecture*, and *access* in this document are **descriptive shorthand only**.

They refer exclusively to:

> **physically instantiated state distinctions that modulate a system’s own future dynamics under intrinsic constraint**,
> as defined in **IER Specification II.A (Physical Information)**.

No semantic, representational, probabilistic, or epistemic primitives are introduced.

---

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.1) identifies experience with a **specific organizational and dynamical regime** instantiated by certain physical systems: a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** operating under **coherent intrinsic constraint**.

This identity claim entails commitments that sharply distinguish IER from many influential theories of mind, consciousness, cognition, and life.
The contrasts below specify **points of incompatibility**—claims that cannot coexist with IER **without abandoning its core identity commitments**.

---

## **1. Reductive Eliminativism**

**Core claim**
Experience does not genuinely exist; it is an illusion, a misdescription, or fully reducible away into behavior, function, representation, or report.

**IER boundary**
IER is strictly physicalist and explicitly **non-eliminativist**.

Under IER:

* experience is **real**
* experience is **physical**
* experience is **identical to an organizational regime**, not a fiction

**Hard incompatibility**
Eliminativism denies the existence of the very regime IER identifies.
The two views cannot be jointly held.

---

## **2. Illusionism and Deflationary Error Theories**

**Core claim**
What we call “experience” is a systematic cognitive error, user-illusion, or representational misinterpretation generated by underlying mechanisms.

**IER boundary**
IER denies that experience is a mistake, inference, or appearance-about-appearances.

Under IER:

* no higher-order illusion is required
* no misrepresentation is needed to explain experience
* experience is the **direct instantiation of a physical regime**

**Hard incompatibility**
Any theory that treats experience as fundamentally illusory conflicts with IER’s identity claim.

---

## **3. Higher-Order and Metacognitive Theories**

**Core claim**
Experience exists only when first-order states are represented, accessed, or endorsed by higher-order states.

**IER boundary**
IER denies that experience depends on higher-order representation or judgment.

Under IER:

* experience does not require being thought about
* no meta-state is constitutive of subjecthood
* experience is present whenever the UEF regime exists

**Hard incompatibility**
IER rejects any theory that makes experience contingent on higher-order access.

---

## **4. Functionalism (Computational or Role-Based)**

**Core claim**
Mental states are defined by functional or computational roles, independent of their physical realization.

**IER boundary**
IER denies that functional role is sufficient for experience.

Under IER:

* functionally identical systems may differ experientially
* roles can be implemented with buffering, orchestration, or decomposition
* such implementations may lack intrinsic constraint and subjecthood

**Hard incompatibility**
IER locates experience in **globally intrinsic, non-offloadable constraint**, not in functional role realization.

---

## **5. Computationalism and Substrate Independence**

**Core claim**
Correct computation or functional organization suffices for experience, regardless of physical substrate; simulation preserves subjecthood.

**IER boundary**
IER denies substrate independence.

Under IER:

* experience depends on **physically instantiated intrinsic constraint**
* abstract computation does not determine where constraint is borne
* simulation or emulation does not guarantee experiential identity

**Hard incompatibility**
Any theory on which correct computation alone suffices for experience is incompatible with IER.

---

## **6. Global Workspace and Access-Based Theories**

**Core claim**
Experience arises when information is globally broadcast, accessible, or available for report and control.

**IER boundary**
IER denies that access or broadcast constitutes experience.

Under IER:

* global access can be externally orchestrated
* broadcasting can occur without ownership of constraint
* access explains reportability, not experiential existence

**Hard incompatibility**
IER requires **globally binding intrinsic constraint**, not merely global availability.

---

## **7. Predictive Processing, Free-Energy, and Control-Theoretic Frameworks**

**Core claim**
Mind and experience are explained in terms of prediction, error minimization, free-energy reduction, or control under uncertainty.

**IER boundary**
IER treats these as **functional descriptions**, not identity conditions.

Under IER:

* predictive regulation may occur without experience
* error minimization can be buffered or offloaded
* optimization stories do not locate where constraint is borne

**Hard incompatibility**
Any account where the same regulatory organization can exist **without intrinsic ownership of constraint** cannot secure UEF identity.

---

## **8. Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**

**Core claim**
Experience corresponds to integrated information, is graded, measurable, and broadly instantiated.

**IER boundary**
IER rejects graded, quantitative, or diagnostic accounts of experience.

Under IER:

* subjecthood is **categorical**
* experience is **non-measurable in principle**
* no scalar quantity tracks “how conscious” a system is
* only one globally dominant UEF can exist per system

**Hard incompatibility**
IER does not identify experience with an integration measure or numeric index.

---

## **9. Panpsychism and Cosmopsychism**

**Core claim**
Experience is fundamental, ubiquitous, or present at all scales of reality.

**IER boundary**
IER explicitly denies ubiquitous or micro-experience.

Under IER:

* most physical systems are non-experiential
* experience requires a narrow organizational regime
* no experiential properties are fundamental features of matter

**Hard incompatibility**
IER denies that experience is basic or universally distributed.

---

## **10. Emergentism (Weak and Strong)**

**Core claim**
Experience emerges as a novel property when systems reach sufficient complexity or organization.

**IER boundary**
IER replaces emergence with **identity**.

Under IER:

* no “further fact” is added beyond the regime itself
* no new ontological property appears
* onset is a **regime transition**, not a property acquisition

**Hard incompatibility**
IER denies that experience emerges *over and above* physical organization.

---

## **11. Dualism and Property Dualism**

**Core claim**
Experience involves non-physical substances or irreducible phenomenal properties.

**IER boundary**
IER affirms strict physical monism.

Under IER:

* no non-physical entities are posited
* no phenomenal primitives are introduced
* no explanatory bridge beyond identity is required

**Hard incompatibility**
Any ontological expansion beyond the physical contradicts IER.

---

## **12. Representationalism and Semantic Realism**

**Core claim**
Experience is constituted by representations with semantic content, reference, or truth conditions.

**IER boundary**
IER denies semantic primitives.

Under IER:

* informational language is organizational shorthand
* representational processes may participate in experience
* representation is **not constitutive** of experience itself

**Hard incompatibility**
IER does not treat experience as essentially semantic or content-bearing.

---

## **13. Autopoiesis and Enactivism**

**Core claim**
Mind or experience consists in self-producing, operationally closed, environment-coupled activity.

**IER boundary**
IER denies that self-production, coupling, or embodiment suffices for experience.

Under IER:

* a system may be autopoietic yet non-experiential
* interaction does not entail ownership of constraint
* operational closure does not guarantee UEF identity

**Hard incompatibility**
IER cannot be interpreted as enactivism plus phenomenology; it makes a strict identity claim with categorical onset and ethical entailments.

---

## **14. Phenomenology and First-Person Epistemic Primacy**

**Core claim**
First-person experience has epistemic authority or priority in determining what is real or true.

**IER boundary**
IER sharply separates experiential access from epistemic access.

Under IER:

* experience is real without being authoritative
* salience, coherence, and intensity do not license belief
* experiential structure confers **no epistemic privilege** (Specification Principle 10)

**Hard incompatibility**
Any framework granting epistemic authority to felt experience conflicts with IER.

---

## **15. Boundary Commitments (Compression List)**

IER jointly entails all of the following:

* experience is **real**
* experience is **physical**
* experience is **identical to an organizational regime**
* subjecthood is **categorical**, not graded
* experience is **non-diagnosable in principle**
* experience is **non-fundamental and non-ubiquitous**
* experience is **ethically real by identity**
* experiential structure has **no epistemic authority**

Any framework that denies any of these commitments is **incompatible with IER**.

---

## **Closing Clarification**

This document does **not** claim that IER refutes, replaces, or subsumes other theories.

It states only that:

> **IER cannot be interpreted as a variant, extension, or synthesis of them.**

IER stands or falls on its identity claim.
The contrasts above specify **what must be rejected if that claim is accepted**.

---

## **How to Read This Matrix**

* **Overlap** ≠ compatibility
  Many frameworks describe *real structure* IER also recognizes.

* **Hard incompatibility** means:
  importing this commitment **forces abandonment of IER’s identity claim**.

* No row claims the framework is false, useless, or unscientific.
  The matrix tracks **identity-level commitments only**.

---

## **Single-Line Diagnostic**

If a framework allows **any** of the following, it is incompatible with IER:

* graded or partial subjecthood
* functional or computational sufficiency
* experiential diagnostics or measures
* semantic or representational primitives
* epistemic authority of experience
* emergence as a “further fact”
* substrate-independent instantiation

# **Appendix B — Rubric-Aligned Orientation Matrix**

### *Descriptive Commitments Across Theories of Experience*

This matrix compresses the contrasts above into a **rubric-aligned orientation table**.
It tracks **how different frameworks situate experience** along shared descriptive dimensions and makes **no evaluative or adjudicative claims**.

The rubric dimensions used here are defined and justified in **`IER-rubric.md`**.
IER’s explanandum boundaries and scope exclusions are fixed in **`IER-explanandum.md`**.

---

## **How to Read This Matrix**

* The matrix is **descriptive, not evaluative**.
  It does not rank, score, or adjudicate theories.

* Rubric dimensions are **orientation lenses**, not demands.
  A theory may reject a dimension as illegitimate.

* **Refusal of diagnostics, access, or measurement is treated as a commitment, not a defect**, in line with `IER-rubric.md`.

* IER’s entries reflect **explanandum discipline**, not comparative ambition, as fixed in `IER-explanandum.md`.

---

## **Single-Line Orientation**

Apparent disputes across theories often arise not from data, but from **differences in explanandum, explanatory form, and epistemic expectations**.

This matrix exists to make those differences explicit—**not to resolve them**.
