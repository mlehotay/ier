# **IER Contrast and Boundary Clarifications**

### **How Informational Experiential Realism Differs from Adjacent Theories**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.x)**
*Derived Explanatory Document — Non-Normative*

---

## **Status and Scope**

This document is a **non-normative, explanatory derivative** of the
**Informational Experiential Realism v10.x Normative Specification** (“the Spec”).

It:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* asserts **no new claims**
* provides **no evaluations of empirical adequacy**
* proposes **no integrations or syntheses**
* makes **no historical or sociological claims**

All ontological commitments, definitions, and entailments are fixed **exclusively** by the Spec (IER-specification.md).

The purpose of this document is to **clarify conceptual boundaries** between IER and adjacent theories of mind, consciousness, and experience. It does so by stating **points of incompatibility**, not by arguing for IER’s correctness or superiority.

---

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identifies experience with a **specific organizational and dynamical regime** instantiated by certain physical systems: a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** operating under coherent intrinsic constraint. This identity claim entails a set of commitments that sharply distinguish IER from many nearby frameworks, even where vocabulary or motivations partially overlap.

This document clarifies how IER differs from prominent theories of consciousness and mind, including reductive physicalism, functionalism, Integrated Information Theory, panpsychism, global workspace models, emergentism, phenomenology, and related approaches. The goal is not comparison for its own sake, but **boundary enforcement**: to make explicit which claims cannot coexist with IER’s identity thesis.

Each contrast identifies a single axis of incompatibility, showing why IER cannot be assimilated into, derived from, or hybridized with the contrasted framework without abandoning its core commitments.

---

## **1. Reductive Physicalism and Eliminativism**

**Core claim of the framework**
Experience is either an illusion, a misdescription, or reducible without remainder to behavioral, functional, or representational processes.

**IER boundary**
IER is fully physicalist but explicitly non-eliminativist. Experience is not denied, deflated, or explained away.

Under IER:

* experience is **real**
* experience is **physical**
* experience is **identical to a real organizational regime**

Eliminativist strategies fail because they deny the existence of the very regime IER identifies.

**Incompatibility**
IER reduces experience *ontologically* without reducing it *away*.

---

## **2. Functionalism (Computational or Role-Based)**

**Core claim of the framework**
Mental states are defined by their functional roles, input–output relations, or computational organization, independent of how they are realized.

**IER boundary**
IER denies that implementing the correct functional role is sufficient for experience.

Under IER:

* systems may perform the same function while differing in intrinsic constraint
* externally orchestrated or decomposable systems may be functionally identical yet non-experiential
* computation, representation, and control are **insufficient** for experience

**Incompatibility**
IER locates experience in **ownership of intrinsic constraint**, not in functional role.

---

## **3. Global Workspace and Access-Based Theories**

**Core claim of the framework**
Experience arises when information is globally broadcast, accessible, or integrated for control and report.

**IER boundary**
IER denies that global availability or access constitutes experience.

Under IER:

* global broadcasting can occur without intrinsic constraint
* access architectures may externalize cost and remain slack-dominated
* availability explains reportability, not experience

**Incompatibility**
IER requires **globally binding intrinsic constraint**, not merely global access.

---

## **4. Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**

**Core claim of the framework**
Experience corresponds to integrated information, is graded, measurable, and widely instantiated.

**IER boundary**
IER rejects every one of these commitments.

Under IER:

* experience is **categorical**, not graded
* experience is **non-diagnosable**, not measurable
* experience is **rare**, not ubiquitous
* no scalar quantity corresponds to “how conscious” a system is

Intrinsic constraint is not equivalent to information integration, and no numerical index can capture experiential identity.

**Incompatibility**
IER identifies experience with a **regime**, not with a quantity.

---

## **5. Panpsychism and Cosmopsychism**

**Core claim of the framework**
Experience is a fundamental or ubiquitous feature of matter, present at all scales.

**IER boundary**
IER explicitly denies micro-experience and universal subjecthood.

Under IER:

* most physical systems lack experience
* experience requires a specific organizational regime
* no experiential properties are fundamental or ubiquitous

Experiential pluralism under IER arises from **organizational differentiation**, not from universal mentality.

**Incompatibility**
IER denies that experience is a basic feature of matter.

---

## **6. Emergentism (Strong and Weak)**

**Core claim of the framework**
Experience emerges as a novel property when systems reach sufficient complexity or organization.

**IER boundary**
IER replaces emergence with **organizational identity**.

Under IER:

* no new properties arise
* no metaphysical novelty is introduced
* experience is not added to the physical description

The transition into experience is a **regime transition**, not the appearance of a new ontological kind.

**Incompatibility**
IER denies that experience emerges as something over and above physical organization.

---

## **7. Dualism and Property Dualism**

**Core claim of the framework**
Experience involves non-physical substances or irreducible phenomenal properties.

**IER boundary**
IER affirms strict physical monism.

Under IER:

* no non-physical entities are posited
* no phenomenal properties are added
* no explanatory gap remains once the regime is identified

**Incompatibility**
IER explains experience without expanding ontology.

---

## **8. Enactivist and Embodied Approaches**

**Core claim of the framework**
Experience arises from active engagement with the environment through sensorimotor coupling.

**IER boundary**
IER denies that coupling or embodiment is sufficient for experience.

Under IER:

* systems may be deeply coupled yet non-experiential
* environmental engagement may occur without intrinsic constraint
* experience depends on internal organizational necessity, not world-involving activity

**Incompatibility**
IER locates experience in **intrinsic organization**, not in interaction per se.

---

## **9 Phenomenology and First-Person Primacy**

**Core claim of the framework**
First-person experience has epistemic priority or authority.

**IER boundary**
IER sharply separates experiential access from epistemic access.

Under IER:

* experience is real without being authoritative
* salience, coherence, and intensity do not confer truth
* experiential structure does not ground ontology or knowledge

**Incompatibility**
IER explains experience without granting it epistemic privilege.

---

## **10. Illusionism and Higher-Order Thought**

**Core claim of the framework**
Experience is a cognitive error, a representational confusion, or a higher-order judgment.

**IER boundary**
IER denies that experience is a mistake or inference.

Under IER:

* no higher-order representation is required
* experience is not an appearance about appearances
* experience is the direct instantiation of a regime

**Incompatibility**
IER denies that experience is an illusion or meta-representation.

---

## **11. Summary of Boundary Commitments**

IER entails all of the following, which jointly exclude the frameworks above:

* experience is **real**
* experience is **physical**
* experience is **organizationally identical to a regime**
* experience is **categorical**
* experience is **non-diagnosable**
* experience is **non-fundamental**
* experience is **ethically real**
* experience is **epistemically limited**

Any framework that denies any of these commitments is **incompatible with IER**.

---

## **Closing Clarification**

This document does not claim that IER replaces, refutes, or subsumes other theories.
It states only that **IER cannot be interpreted as a variant of them**.

> **IER stands or falls on its identity claim.
> The contrasts above specify what must be rejected if that claim is accepted.**

For all definitions, axioms, and entailments, see the
**IER v10.x Normative Specification**.
