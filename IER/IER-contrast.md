## **Contrast and Boundary Clarifications**

### **How Informational Experiential Realism Differs from Adjacent Theories**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8)**
*Derived Explanatory Document — Non-Normative*

---

## **Status and Scope**

This document is a **non-normative, explanatory derivative** of:

```
IER-specification.md   (v10.8)
```

It:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* asserts **no new ontological claims**
* proposes **no integrations or syntheses**
* makes **no empirical evaluations**
* establishes **no criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics**

All definitions, identity claims, regime conditions, and ethical entailments are fixed **exclusively** by the Specification. If any statement here conflicts with the Specification, **the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

The sole purpose of this document is **boundary enforcement**: to clarify which adjacent frameworks **cannot be reconciled with IER’s identity claim**, even where vocabulary or motivations overlap.

---

### **Global Informational Language Disclaimer**

All uses of *information*, *integration*, *coherence*, *constraint*, *architecture*, and *access* in this document are **descriptive shorthand only**.

They refer exclusively to:

> **physically instantiated state distinctions that modulate a system’s own future dynamics under intrinsic constraint**,
> as defined in **IER Specification II.A (Physical Information)**.

No semantic, representational, probabilistic, or epistemic primitives are introduced.

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8) identifies experience with a **specific organizational and dynamical regime** instantiated by certain physical systems: a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** operating under **coherent intrinsic constraint**.

This identity claim entails commitments that sharply distinguish IER from many neighboring theories of mind, consciousness, life, and cognition. The contrasts below do not argue for IER’s correctness. They specify **points of incompatibility**—claims that cannot coexist with IER without abandoning its core commitments.

---

## **1. Reductive Eliminativism**

**Core claim of the framework**
Experience is an illusion, a misdescription, or fully reducible *away* into behavior, function, representation, or report.

**IER boundary**
IER is strictly physicalist but explicitly non-eliminativist.

Under IER:

* experience is **real**
* experience is **physical**
* experience is **identical to an organizational regime**

**Incompatibility**
IER reduces experience *ontologically* without reducing it *away*. Eliminativism denies the existence of the very regime IER identifies.

---

## **2. Functionalism (Computational or Role-Based)**

**Core claim of the framework**
Mental states are defined by functional roles or computational relations, independent of how they are realized.

**IER boundary**
IER denies that functional role is sufficient for experience.

Under IER:

* functionally similar or identical systems may differ in experiential status
* externally orchestrated or decomposable systems may implement the same roles without experience
* computation, control, and representation are **insufficient** for subjecthood

**Incompatibility**
IER locates experience in **globally intrinsic constraint** and **ownership of constraint resolution**, not in functional role.

---

## **3. Global Workspace and Access-Based Theories**

**Core claim of the framework**
Experience arises when information is globally broadcast, accessible, or available for report and control.

**IER boundary**
IER denies that global access constitutes experience.

Under IER:

* global broadcasting can occur without intrinsic constraint
* access architectures may remain slack-dominated and externally resolvable
* availability explains reportability and control, not experiential existence

**Incompatibility**
IER requires **globally binding intrinsic constraint**, not merely global access.

---

## **4. Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**

**Core claim of the framework**
Experience corresponds to integrated information, is graded, measurable, and broadly instantiated.

**IER boundary**
IER rejects these commitments.

Under IER:

* experience is **categorical**, not graded
* experience is **non-diagnosable**, not measurable
* no scalar quantity corresponds to “how conscious” a system is
* experience is identified with a **regime**, not a magnitude

**Incompatibility**
IER does not equate experiential identity with an integration measure or numeric index.

---

## **5. Panpsychism and Cosmopsychism**

**Core claim of the framework**
Experience is fundamental or ubiquitous, present at all scales.

**IER boundary**
IER explicitly denies micro-experience and universal subjecthood.

Under IER:

* most physical systems lack experience
* experience requires a specific organizational regime
* no experiential properties are fundamental or ubiquitous

**Incompatibility**
IER denies that experience is a basic feature of matter.

---

## **6. Emergentism (Strong and Weak)**

**Core claim of the framework**
Experience emerges as a novel property when systems reach sufficient complexity or organization.

**IER boundary**
IER replaces emergence with **organizational identity**.

Under IER:

* no new ontological properties are introduced
* experience is not added to the physical description
* onset is a **regime transition**, not the appearance of a new kind

**Incompatibility**
IER denies that experience emerges as something over and above physical organization.

---

## **7. Dualism and Property Dualism**

**Core claim of the framework**
Experience involves non-physical substances or irreducible phenomenal properties.

**IER boundary**
IER affirms strict physical monism.

Under IER:

* no non-physical entities are posited
* no phenomenal properties are added
* no explanatory bridge is required once the regime is identified

**Incompatibility**
IER cannot be reconciled with any ontological expansion beyond the physical.

---

## **8. Representationalism and Semantic Realism**

**Core claim of the framework**
Experience is constituted by representations with semantic content, truth conditions, or reference relations.

**IER boundary**
IER denies semantic primitives and denies that representation is constitutive of experience.

Under IER:

* “informational” language is descriptive shorthand for physical organization (Specification II.A)
* experience is an organizational regime, not a semantic relation
* truth conditions are not part of the ontology of experience

**Incompatibility**
IER does not treat experience as essentially representational or content-bearing in the semantic sense.

---

## **9. Autopoiesis and Enactivism**

**Core claim of the framework**
Life (and, in some extensions, mind) consists in self-producing, operationally closed organization, often with strong emphasis on environment-coupled activity.

**IER boundary**
IER denies that self-production, operational closure, coupling, or embodiment is sufficient for experience.

Under IER:

* a system may be autopoietic yet non-experiential
* coupling can occur without intrinsic constraint
* operational closure does not entail UEF identity
* experience depends on **globally unavoidable intrinsic constraint**, not interaction per se

**Incompatibility**
IER cannot be interpreted as “autopoiesis applied to consciousness,” nor as “enactivism plus phenomenology,” because it makes a strict identity claim with categorical onset and ethical entailments.

---

## **10. Phenomenology and First-Person Primacy**

**Core claim of the framework**
First-person experience has epistemic priority or authority over claims about reality.

**IER boundary**
IER sharply separates experiential access from epistemic access.

Under IER:

* experience is real without being authoritative
* salience, coherence, and intensity do not confer truth
* experiential structure does not ground ontology or knowledge

**Incompatibility**
Any framework granting epistemic privilege to felt authority conflicts with **IER Specification Principle 10 (Epistemic Non-Authority)**.

---

## **11. Illusionism and Higher-Order Theories**

**Core claim of the framework**
Experience is a cognitive error, a higher-order judgment, or a representational misdescription.

**IER boundary**
IER denies that experience is an inference or a mistake.

Under IER:

* no higher-order representation is required
* experience is not an “appearance about appearances”
* experience is the direct instantiation of a regime

**Incompatibility**
IER denies that experience is an illusion produced by meta-representation.

---

## **12. Boundary Commitments (Compression List)**

IER entails all of the following, which jointly exclude the frameworks above:

* experience is **real**
* experience is **physical**
* experience is **organizationally identical to a regime**
* experience is **categorical** (no graded subjecthood)
* experience is **non-diagnosable in principle**
* experience is **non-fundamental and non-ubiquitous**
* experience is **ethically real by identity**
* experiential structure has **no epistemic authority** (Principle 10)

Any framework that denies any of these commitments is **incompatible with IER**.

---

## **Closing Clarification**

This document does not claim that IER replaces, refutes, or subsumes other theories. It states only that **IER cannot be interpreted as a variant of them**.

> **IER stands or falls on its identity claim.
> The contrasts above specify what must be rejected if that claim is accepted.**
