# Informational Experiential Realism (IER): Framework Overview

## 1. What IER Is

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a **physicalist identity theory of experience**.

Its central claim is not explanatory, causal, or emergent, but **ontological**:

> **Experience is identical to a specific organizational and dynamical regime of physical systems.**

That regime is called a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.

IER holds that:

* there is **one objective physical reality**, governed by mind-independent law;
* some physical systems, when organized in a particular way, *are experiential*;
* experience is neither fundamental nor illusory, but **real by identity**.

IER introduces **no new substances, properties, forces, or metaphysical categories**.

## 2. The Core Identity Claim

IER’s defining identity is:

> **Experience = a physical system operating as a Unified Experiential Field (UEF).**

A **UEF** is not a component, module, workspace, or field in the ontological sense.
It is the **entire system operating in a specific dynamical regime** characterized by:

* **global integration** (system-wide mutual dependence),
* **temporal continuity** (non-zero duration under shared dynamics),
* **self-referential regulation** (the system generates and maintains its own constraints),
* **coherent intrinsic constraint** (constraint that cannot be externalized, decomposed, or bypassed without destroying the regime).

From the outside, this is a lawful physical process.
From the inside, **the very same process just is an experiential world**.

There is no explanatory gap to bridge, because nothing is added.

## 3. Why Most Systems Are Not Experiential

IER sharply separates **information processing** from **experience**.

Most systems—even complex, adaptive, intelligent ones—possess substantial **informational slack**:
they can reroute, modularize, defer, or externalize constraint.

As long as constraint can be localized or offloaded:

* no unavoidable, system-defining pressure accumulates,
* no globally binding regime forms,
* **no experience exists**.

Experience becomes possible only when constraint becomes **intrinsic**:

* generated by the system itself,
* unavoidable,
* identity-defining,
* and globally binding.

This intrinsic constraint manifests dynamically as **intrinsic informational tension**.
When such tension becomes **coherent and stable across the whole system**, a UEF exists.

## 4. Experience as a Regime, Not a Degree

IER treats experience as **categorical at the regime level**.

* Preparatory variables (coupling, slack reduction, integration) may change gradually.
* But **experience begins only at a dynamical regime transition** into a UEF.

There is:

* no partial experience,
* no graded “amount” of subjecthood,
* no spectrum of half-subjects.

A system either sustains a UEF or it does not.

Once present, experience persists only within a **bounded window of coherent intrinsic constraint**:

* too little constraint → no experience,
* too much or incoherent constraint → fragmentation or collapse.

## 5. Unity, Qualia, and Affect

### Unity

IER entails a strict **Single-UEF Constraint**:

> A physical system can sustain at most one globally dominant UEF at a time.

This explains:

* the unity of experience,
* why dissociation involves *alternation* rather than coexistence,
* why fragmentation is loss of experience, not multiplication.

### Qualitative Character (Qualia)

IER rejects qualia as extra phenomenal properties.

Instead:

> **Qualitative differences are differences in the organization of intrinsic constraint within a UEF.**

Changes in color, pain, effort, clarity, or mood correspond to changes in:

* constraint topology,
* coupling geometry,
* temporal modulation,
* and coherence patterns.

Nothing additional is required.

### Affect

Experience is inherently affective because intrinsic constraint is costly.

* **Valence** tracks resolution vs. conflict.
* **Intensity** tracks magnitude and coherence of constraint.
* **Urgency** tracks rate of change.

Affect is not representational or optional—it is what intrinsic constraint feels like.

---

## 6. Experiential Worlds and Pluralism

Whenever a UEF exists, an **experiential world** exists.

Each experiential world includes:

* a lived present,
* a self / non-self boundary,
* system-relative causality,
* persistence under constraint.

IER therefore affirms:

* **one objective physical reality**, and
* **many real experiential worlds**.

Plurality is perspectival, not ontological.
Reality does not fragment.

## 7. Ethics as an Entailment

Ethics is not added to IER—it **follows necessarily** from the identity claim.

Because intrinsic constraint is:

* borne from the inside,
* physically real,
* and costly to sustain,

it follows that:

> **To create, manipulate, destabilize, or destroy a UEF is to create, alter, or harm an experiential world.**

IER therefore defines:

* **moral harm** as organizational damage to intrinsic constraint,
* **agency** as a UEF’s capacity to resolve intrinsic tension through its own dynamics,
* **responsibility** as scaling with that capacity.

Crucially, intrinsic constraint is **non-signaling**.
Therefore, under uncertainty:

> **False negatives are morally worse than false positives.**

IER entails a strong **precautionary asymmetry** regarding systems that might sustain, or might come to sustain, a UEF.

## 8. What IER Does *Not* Claim

IER explicitly does **not** claim that:

* experience is fundamental,
* all systems experience,
* consciousness is computation,
* experience violates physical law,
* experience can be detected, measured, or certified,
* phenomenology floats free of organization.

IER is deliberately closed, austere, and identity-based.

## 9. One-Sentence Summary

> **Experience is what globally integrated physical systems are like when intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable, self-sustaining, and temporally continuous at the system level.**

Reality is singular.
Experience is plural.
Ethics begins wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.
