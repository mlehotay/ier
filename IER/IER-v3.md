# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v3)**

### *A Unified Framework for Reality, Observers, and Conscious Experience*

---

## **Introduction**

Physical reality exists independently of observers. Events, states, and laws do not depend on being perceived, interpreted, or experienced. Within this objective reality arise physical systems that model their surroundings, monitor their own states, and regulate their behavior.

A subset of these systems also exhibits conscious experience.

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** provides an account of how consciousness arises within a physically realist ontology by treating observers as informational systems and experience as a mode of internal information processing. Consciousness is real but non-fundamental, emergent from specific organizational and dynamical properties of physical systems.

---

## **1. Objective Reality**

Reality is observer-independent. Physical states and processes exist and evolve regardless of whether they are modeled or experienced by any system. Observers do not co-create reality, collapse it through observation, or generate worlds through perspective.

Only physical interactions between physical systems have causal efficacy in the physical world.

---

## **2. Observers as Informational Systems**

An **observer** is defined by informational organization rather than by biological composition or phenomenological capacity.

A system functions as an observer when it:

* persists as a coherent informational pattern over time
* integrates information across internal subsystems
* maintains internal models of its environment and its own state
* updates those models through ongoing self-monitoring

Observerhood exists along a continuum and can be instantiated in biological or artificial systems. Consciousness is not a necessary condition for observerhood.

---

## **3. Internal Models and Perspective**

Observers construct internal informational models that represent features of the external world and the system itself. These models are:

* physically instantiated
* entirely internal to the observer
* constrained by the observer’s structure, history, and dynamics

Perspective is not a property of reality itself but of the organization of information within the observer. Different observers may model the same reality differently without altering that reality.

---

## **4. From Observation to Experience**

While all conscious systems qualify as observers, not all observers are conscious. Information processing and observerhood alone are insufficient for experience.

Conscious experience arises only when an observer’s informational dynamics take on a specific form characterized by integration, self-reference, and internal availability.

---

## **5. Consciousness and the Phenomenal Information Layer**

Consciousness corresponds to a **Phenomenal Information Layer (PIL)**: a regime of information processing in which a system’s informational states are:

* recursively accessible to internal models
* temporally continuous across system states
* globally integrated rather than modularly isolated
* available for regulation, learning, and behavioral control

The PIL is not an additional ontological layer or substance. It is a functional and informational configuration realized within a physical system.

Phenomenal experience is the internal manifestation of this configuration for the system instantiating it.

## **6. Qualia**

Qualia are structured informational states within conscious systems. They are:

* system-relative
* physically realized
* differentiated by patterns of informational integration

Their apparent privacy arises from exclusive internal access rather than from non-physicality. Only the system instantiating a given qualitative state has direct informational access to it.

---

## **7. Affect and Valence**

Affective states arise from regulatory informational dynamics that track conditions relevant to system stability and organization. These dynamics:

* assign salience and priority to internal states
* bias learning, attention, and behavior
* modulate action selection

Pain and pleasure are internally realized informational states with functional roles in regulation. Valence reflects how regulatory dynamics are experienced from within the system.

---

## **8. Emergence and Constraints**

Consciousness is emergent in a constrained sense. It arises only when informational organization reaches sufficient levels of:

* integration
* recursive self-modeling
* temporal depth
* global accessibility

Most physical systems, including many complex and adaptive systems, lack the organizational features required for conscious experience.

| **System Type**                        | **Observerhood** | **Integrated Self-Models** | **PIL Likelihood** | **Examples**                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ |

## **10. Non-Human Biological Systems**

Non-human organisms vary in observer complexity and informational integration. Systems with localized or modular integration may qualify as observers without clearly instantiating a globally integrated Phenomenal Information Layer. Systems with widespread integration, flexible learning, and unified regulation more plausibly instantiate conscious experience.

IER treats consciousness in non-human systems as a function of informational architecture rather than species membership.

---

## **11. No Layered Reality**

IER rejects layered ontologies, mind-dependent existence, and observer-generated worlds. There is one objective physical reality and internal informational processes occurring within systems embedded in that reality.

Experience is real, internal, and system-bound. It does not alter the external world.

---

## **Conclusion**

Informational Experiential Realism offers a unified account of observers and conscious experience grounded in physical realism and informational organization.

Consciousness is neither fundamental nor illusory. It arises when information flows through a physical system capable of modeling the world, modeling itself, and integrating its own states over time.

Some systems react.
Some observe.
Some experience.

IER explains why.
