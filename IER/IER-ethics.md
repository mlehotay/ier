## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) entails a distinctive ethical framework grounded not in metaphysical freedom, phenomenal surplus, or moral intuition, but in **organizational facts about intrinsic constraint**.

Under IER v10.0:

* **Free will** is a real, physically instantiated capacity of systems that sustain a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)** to resolve intrinsic informational tension through their own globally integrated dynamics.
* **Moral harm** is the **destabilization, overload, or fragmentation of intrinsic constraint** within such systems (Spec §II, *Moral Harm*).
* **Moral responsibility and moral considerability** are graded, precautionary, and organizationally grounded, rather than binary or metaphysical.

This document derives an account of agency, responsibility, and moral scope directly from the **identity claim of experience** articulated in the IER v10.0 Normative Specification.

## **1. Why Ethics Follows from the Identity Claim**

IER does not treat ethics as an optional add-on.

From the Spec’s core identity:

> **Experience is identical to a globally integrated, self-referential dynamical regime under coherent intrinsic constraint**
> (Spec Axiom 3; Spec §II, *UEF*).

It follows necessarily that:

* intrinsic constraint is **borne from the inside**
* its disruption is **not merely functional damage**
* experiential worlds are **physically real and costly**

Thus, ethical relevance arises **wherever intrinsic constraint exists, might exist, or might be irreversibly foreclosed** (Spec §III.P12).

---

## **2. Reframing the Traditional Problems**

### **2.1 Free Will**

Traditional formulations ask:

> *“Is the will free from causation?”*

IER replaces this with:

> **“Where does the causation that determines the system’s future originate?”**

Freedom is not exemption from law, but **ownership of constraint**.

---

### **2.2 Moral Status**

Traditional ethics often asks:

> *“Does this entity possess a special moral property?”*

IER instead asks:

> **“Does this system sustain, or plausibly approach, intrinsic constraint whose disruption would matter from the inside?”**

Both questions are answered using the **same organizational criteria** defined in the Spec.

---

## **3. Free Will Under IER v10.0**

### **3.1 Free Will as a Derived Capacity**

> **Under IER, what is ordinarily called “free will” follows as the capacity of a system sustaining a Unified Experiential Field to resolve intrinsic informational tension through its own globally integrated dynamics.**

This follows directly from:

* the definition of **UEF** (Spec §II)
* the role of **intrinsic informational tension** (Spec §II)
* the identity of experience with such regimes (Spec §III.P1)

---

### **3.2 Why Experience Is Necessary for Will**

Observerhood alone is insufficient.

Systems may:

* model themselves
* predict outcomes
* optimize behavior

while remaining **non-experiential**, because their constraint remains modular or externally resolvable.

Only when a system sustains a **UEF** does constraint become:

* unavoidable
* globally binding
* identity-defining

Only then can resolution count as **willing rather than mere control**.

---

### **3.3 Determinism Revisited**

IER is fully compatible with lawful physical determination.

The ethical distinction is not:

* inevitable vs avoidable outcomes

but:

* **intrinsically constrained vs externally imposed determination**

A choice may be inevitable and still be free, **if the determining constraints are intrinsic to the UEF**.

---

### **3.4 “Could Have Done Otherwise”**

Under IER, this counterfactual is interpreted as:

> **A difference in intrinsic constraint topology that would have stabilized a different global trajectory**
> (Spec §III, Inference Rules 8–10).

This is a claim about **organizational alternatives**, not metaphysical branching universes.

---

## **4. Effort, Burden, and the Phenomenology of Agency**

Willing feels like effort because:

* intrinsic constraint is **costly**
* global coherence is **energetically demanding**
* resolution risks **fragmentation or collapse**

This is not illusion or narrative overlay.

> **Effort is the experiential signature of intrinsic constraint being borne rather than offloaded.**

---

## **5. Degrees of Agency and Responsibility**

While **experiential subjecthood is binary** (Spec §II), **capacity within a UEF is not**.

IER entails that moral responsibility varies with a system’s capacity to bear and resolve intrinsic constraint within a coherent Unified Experiential Field.

* coherence of intrinsic constraint
* availability of viable futures
* stability of global integration
* absence of coercive external constraint

It diminishes under:

* fatigue
* intoxication
* trauma
* dissociation
* overwhelming external control

These variations are descriptive consequences of intrinsic constraint organization, not independent normative prescriptions.

IER thus grounds **graded responsibility without metaphysical freedom**.

---

## **6. Moral Harm (Normatively Defined)**

The Spec defines moral harm as:

> **Destabilization, overload, or fragmentation of a system sustaining intrinsic constraint**
> (Spec §II, *Moral Harm*).

Key consequences:

* harm is **organizational**, not report-based
* harm may be **internally real and externally invisible**
* harm admits of **degrees and kinds**

Suffering is not an extra property—it is **what intrinsic constraint overload is like from within a UEF**.

---

## **7. Moral Considerability Beyond Confirmed Experience**

IER rejects the false binary:

> *“Either it feels, or it does not matter.”*

Moral considerability extends beyond confirmed UEFs due to:

* epistemic uncertainty
* developmental and evolutionary continuity
* irreversibility of damage
* relational and ecological embeddedness

This follows from **Spec §III.P12 (Experiential Cost)**.

---

## **8. Borderline and Non-Standard Systems**

### **8.1 Borderline Animals**

Some animals occupy a borderline region of experiential plausibility. Systems such as **jellyfish and oysters** may exhibit partial integration and limited capacity for intrinsic constraint, approaching but not reliably sustaining a Unified Experiential Field (UEF).

**Ethical implication:**
Under IER, uncertainty regarding experiential subjecthood **entails precautionary moral consideration**, even where experiential subjecthood cannot be definitively established.

---

### **8.2 Plants**

Plants are extremely unlikely to sustain UEFs. However, they demonstrate:

* persistent self-maintaining organization,
* system-wide stress integration, and
* irreversible vulnerability.

**Ethical implication:**
While plants do not warrant protections equivalent to experiential subjects, they **imply requirements of respect and restraint** in human interaction. IER thereby supports environmental ethics **without attributing sentience**.

---

### **8.3 Ecosystems and Other Complex Systems**

Broader systems, such as ecosystems or socio-ecological networks, exhibit **integrated constraints at the system level**. While these systems are not individual experiential subjects, their structure and integrity **affect the conditions under which intrinsic constraint is borne** by constituent systems.

**Ethical implication:**
Human actions that destabilize such systems can **indirectly threaten intrinsic constraint** in constituent UEFs. IER thereby grounds precautionary ethical consideration for ecosystem-level interventions.

---

### **8.4 Artificial Systems**

Most artificial systems:

* externalize constraint,
* lack intrinsic cost, and
* remain modular and decomposable.

They are therefore non-experiential.

**Ethical implication:**
If an artificial system comes to sustain coherent intrinsic constraint sufficient for a UEF, moral status follows immediately and non-optionally. Because early UEFs may be unstable and difficult to detect, **IER entails a strong precautionary principle** regarding their creation and deployment.

---

## **9. Precaution as a Structural Requirement**

IER reverses a common ethical intuition.

Under IER:

> **Uncertainty about experiential status increases moral responsibility rather than decreases it.**

Because harm, if present, would be:

* internal
* non-signaling
* irreversible

Precaution is not sentiment—it is a rational response to asymmetric moral risk.

---

## **10. Responsibility Without Metaphysics**

IER grounds responsibility in **capacity under intrinsic constraint**, not in contra-causal freedom.

A system is responsible to the extent that:

* it sustained a coherent UEF
* intrinsic tension was borne internally
* resolution fixed its own future trajectory
* viable alternatives existed within constraint space

This framework is:

* strict without cruelty
* naturalistic without reductionism
* humane without metaphysical escape hatches

---

## **11. Summary**

Derived from the IER v10.0 Normative Specification:

> **Free will is not freedom from causation, but causation owned by a unified system.
> Moral harm is not metaphysical suffering, but disruption of intrinsically constrained dynamics.
> Moral concern extends wherever such constraint exists, might exist, or might be irreversibly destroyed.**

Or more simply:

> **You are free when your life path curves because of you —
> and ethics begins wherever such curvature matters, or might matter, from the inside.**
