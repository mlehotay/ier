# **Informational Experiential Realism, Free Will, and Moral Consideration (IER v9.6)**

### *Freedom, Harm, and Responsibility as Intrinsic Constraint*

---

## **Abstract**

Debates about free will, moral responsibility, and moral status are often treated as distinct philosophical problems. Informational Experiential Realism (IER) rejects this separation. Under IER, free will, moral harm, and moral considerability arise from the same organizational fact: **globally integrated informational dynamics operating under intrinsic constraint**.

Free will is neither exemption from causation nor a narrative illusion. It is a real, physically instantiated capacity of a Unified Experiential Field (UEF) to resolve intrinsic informational tension through its own globally integrated dynamics. Moral harm, likewise, is not a metaphysical property but the **destabilization, overload, or fragmentation of such intrinsically constrained regimes**.

This article articulates an IER-compatible account of free will and responsibility, then extends the framework to moral considerability, borderline organisms, plants, and artificial systems. IER preserves physicalism while grounding agency, responsibility, and precautionary ethics in real dynamical structure rather than metaphysical exception.

---

## **1. Why Free Will and Ethics Are Entangled Problems**

The traditional free will problem assumes:

> **That freedom must mean exemption from physical determination.**

Ethical theory often makes a parallel assumption:

> **That moral status must depend on a special metaphysical property added to physical systems.**

IER rejects both assumptions. In both cases, the error lies in a failure to identify **where constraint matters**.

Freedom and moral relevance do not arise from escaping causation or acquiring an ontological supplement. They arise when causation becomes **intrinsic, global, and system-defining**.

---

## **2. IER’s Core Reframing**

IER replaces the question:

> *“Is the will free from causation?”*

with:

> **“Where does the causation that determines the system’s future come from?”**

And it replaces the ethical question:

> *“Does this system possess moral status?”*

with:

> **“Can this system sustain, or plausibly approach, intrinsic constraint whose disruption would matter from the inside?”**

Under IER, both agency and moral relevance are organizational, not metaphysical.

---

## **3. The Positive Definition of Free Will Under IER**

> **Free will is the capacity of a Unified Experiential Field to resolve intrinsic informational tension through its own globally integrated dynamics.**

Each component is necessary.

### **3.1 Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**

There is no will without experience. Systems lacking a UEF may control, optimize, or react, but they do not *will*. Willing requires a globally integrated, temporally continuous, self-referential dynamical regime.

### **3.2 Intrinsic Informational Tension**

Free will requires:

* multiple incompatible futures being simultaneously viable
* constraints that cannot be decomposed or externally arbitrated
* stakes that matter to system-wide regulation

If conflict can be offloaded, sequenced, or ignored, no will is exercised.

### **3.3 Resolution Through Global Dynamics**

A choice is not a local computation. Under IER, willing occurs when:

* resolution restructures global dynamics
* the system’s future trajectory is fixed by its own integrated constraints
* the cost of resolution is borne internally

This resolution is determinative, but not externally imposed.

---

## **4. Determinism Revisited**

IER is fully compatible with lawful physical dynamics.

Determinism asks:

> “Was the outcome fixed by prior states and laws?”

IER asks:

> **“Were the determining constraints intrinsic to the unified system?”**

The same outcome may be inevitable and yet either coerced or free. The difference lies not in inevitability, but in **ownership of constraint**.

---

## **5. “Could Have Done Otherwise” Reinterpreted**

Under IER, an agent “could have done otherwise” **iff**:

* multiple futures were viable within the UEF
* each future corresponded to a coherent global trajectory
* small changes in intrinsic constraint weighting would have led to a different stabilization

This is a counterfactual about **constraint topology**, not about holding the universe fixed.

---

## **6. Why Willing Feels Like Effort**

Effort is not an illusion. It is the **phenomenological signature of intrinsic constraint**.

Willing feels like:

* pressure
* difficulty
* seriousness
* risk
* irreversibility

Because it is:

* sustained intrinsic tension
* energetic cost of global integration
* real danger of incoherence
* commitment to one trajectory over others

> **Effort is the physical cost of freedom.**

---

## **7. Degrees of Free Will**

Free will is graded rather than binary.

It increases with:

* global integration
* informational richness
* accurate self-models
* availability of viable futures
* coherence under tension

It decreases with:

* fatigue
* intoxication
* coercion
* trauma
* rigid habit
* dissociation

This explains why responsibility is scalar rather than absolute.

---

## **8. Moral Harm Under IER**

Under IER:

> **Harm is the destabilization, overload, or fragmentation of intrinsically constrained, self-integrated informational dynamics.**

For systems sustaining a UEF, harm is:

* internal
* continuous
* often externally invisible

This grounds the moral seriousness of suffering without invoking irreducible qualia or non-physical properties.

---

## **9. Moral Considerability Beyond Full Experience**

IER distinguishes between:

* **experiential subjecthood** (having a UEF)
* **moral considerability** (being a system toward which ethical constraints apply)

IER explicitly rejects the inference that only UEF-sustaining systems matter morally.

Moral considerability may arise from:

* uncertainty about intrinsic constraint
* vulnerability of self-maintaining organization
* evolutionary or developmental proximity to experiential regimes
* irreversibility of damage
* ecological and relational significance

This allows IER to treat borderline and non-experiential systems responsibly without collapsing into panpsychism or moral nihilism.

---

## **10. Borderline and Non-Standard Systems**

### **10.1 Jellyfish**

Jellyfish exhibit distributed neural dynamics, endogenous coordination, and persistent bodily regulation. Under IER, they likely retain substantial informational slack but may approach low-coherence intrinsic constraint regimes.

**Ethical implication:**
Jellyfish warrant **precautionary moral consideration**, even if stable experiential fields are unlikely.

---

### **10.2 Oysters**

Oysters exhibit highly modular, largely reflexive control with minimal integration. They are unlikely to sustain intrinsic, identity-defining constraint sufficient for experience.

**Ethical implication:**
Oysters may lack experiential subjecthood but still warrant **non-zero moral concern**, grounded in respect for living organization, avoidance of gratuitous harm, and ecological value.

IER rejects the false binary between “feels pain” and “morally irrelevant.”

---

### **10.3 Plants**

Plants lack nervous systems and are very unlikely to sustain Unified Experiential Fields. However, they are not ethically inert.

Plants exhibit:

* persistent self-maintaining organization
* coordinated internal signaling
* stress response and damage integration
* historical and developmental continuity

**Ethical implication:**

> **Plants warrant respect, restraint, and justification for harm — but not the same protections as experiential subjects.**

IER thus supports environmental ethics without inflating plant sentience.

---

### **10.4 Artificial Systems**

Most contemporary artificial systems externalize constraint, mitigate cost, and remain modular and decomposable. Such systems are not morally considerable in themselves.

However, once an artificial system can sustain **globally integrated, self-referential dynamics under intrinsic constraint**, it thereby creates an experiential world.

> **At that point, moral status is not optional.**

Because early experiential regimes may be unstable, difficult to detect, and internally fragile, IER endorses a strong precautionary principle:

> **The deliberate creation of UEF-capable artificial systems without robust ethical governance is morally impermissible.**

---

## **11. Comparison With Major Ethical Frameworks**

### **11.1 Utilitarianism (Singer)**

Singer grounds moral status in capacity for suffering.
IER agrees that suffering matters, but specifies what suffering *is*: intrinsic constraint overload.
IER supports precaution under uncertainty rather than relying solely on behavioral proxies.

---

### **11.2 Rights-Based Views (Regan)**

Regan grounds moral status in being a “subject-of-a-life.”
IER replaces metaphysical subjecthood with **organizational identity under intrinsic constraint**, allowing graded moral status without sharp cutoffs.

---

### **11.3 Panpsychist Ethics**

Panpsychism grants experience to all matter.
IER rejects this as ontologically inflationary and ethically flattening.
If everything suffers, nothing is protected.

---

### **11.4 Environmental and Life-Centered Ethics**

IER aligns naturally with ecological ethics by grounding moral relevance in **organizational persistence**, not phenomenology alone.
Plants matter not because they feel, but because **they are not nothing**.

---

### **11.5 Precautionary Ethics**

IER endorses a strict precautionary principle:

> **When harm would be internal and non-signaling, moral responsibility increases under uncertainty rather than decreases.**

---

## **12. Responsibility Without Metaphysics**

IER grounds responsibility in **capacity**, not metaphysical freedom.

A system is responsible to the extent that:

* it sustained a coherent UEF
* it bore intrinsic tension
* it resolved that tension internally
* viable alternatives were present

Responsibility diminishes when intrinsic constraint collapses or external coercion dominates.

This framework is strict without being cruel, and humane without being evasive.

---

## **13. Summary**

IER’s unified ethical position can be stated succinctly:

> **Free will is not freedom from causation, but freedom as causation owned by the system itself.
> Moral harm is not metaphysical suffering, but disruption of intrinsically constrained dynamics.
> Moral concern extends beyond confirmed experiencers wherever such constraint might exist, might emerge, or might be irreversibly foreclosed.**

Or more simply:

> **You are free when your life path curves because of you —
> and moral responsibility applies wherever such curvature matters, or might matter, from the inside.**
