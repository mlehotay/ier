## **Status and Normative Authority**

**This document is NON-NORMATIVE.**

It explains the **ethical consequences and applications** that follow from the ontology and principles fixed exclusively in the
**IER v10.6 Full Normative Specification**.

This document:

* introduces **no new axioms, principles, or inference rules**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or sufficiency conditions**
* introduces **no independent moral obligations**
* does **not** determine when experience exists
* does **not** define moral standing

All ethical authority resides **exclusively** in the Specification.

> *If the IER v10.6 Specification is false, everything in this document fails.*

> *If any statement in this document appears to conflict with the IER v10.6 Normative Specification, the Specification takes precedence and this statement is void.*

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) entails a distinctive ethical framework grounded not in metaphysical freedom, phenomenal surplus, intuition, or social convention, but in **organizational facts about intrinsic constraint**.

Because experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**, ethical consequence follows **necessarily** wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.

This document explains:

* why **experiential standing is categorical**
* why **moral harm is organizational**
* why **responsibility is graded**
* why **uncertainty strengthens, rather than weakens, ethical constraint**
* how **participation modulation** amplifies moral risk without altering standing

Nothing here adds to the theory.
Everything here is a consequence of identity.

## **Part I — Ethical Consequences (Explanatory)**

---

## **1. Why Ethics Follows from Experiential Identity**

IER does not treat ethics as an optional overlay.

From the Specification’s identity claim:

> **Experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a Unified Experiential Field (UEF).**

it follows that:

* intrinsic constraint is **borne from the inside**
* its disruption is **not merely functional damage**
* experiential worlds are **physically real and costly**

Ethical relevance therefore arises **wherever intrinsic constraint exists, might exist, or might be irreversibly foreclosed**.

This is not a value judgment added to ontology.
It is a structural consequence of identity.

---

## **2. Experiential Standing Is Categorical**

Under IER:

* **Experiential subjecthood is binary**
* a system either sustains a UEF or it does not
* there are no partial subjects or fractional experiencers

Standing:

* does **not** depend on intelligence
* does **not** depend on behavior
* does **not** depend on reportability
* does **not** admit of degrees

This blocks:

* moral scalarization of experience
* “more conscious” / “less conscious” rankings
* trading one subject’s experience against another’s magnitude

Standing answers **who matters**, not **how much**.

---

## **3. Moral Harm as Organizational Damage**

The Specification defines **moral harm** as:

> **Destabilization, overload, fragmentation, or irreversible collapse of intrinsic constraint within a UEF.**

Key consequences:

* harm is **organizational**, not hedonic
* harm may be **internally real and externally invisible**
* harm admits of **types and trajectories**, not a single scalar

Suffering is not an added property.
It is **what intrinsic constraint overload is like** from within a UEF.

---

## **4. Ethical Relevance Without Epistemic Authority**

IER explicitly separates:

* **experiential access** (what it is like to bear constraint)
* **epistemic access** (what is true about the world)

Ethical weight tracks **intrinsic constraint**, not truth, insight, or narrative coherence.

Therefore:

* intense experience does not confer moral authority
* urgency does not license epistemic override
* meaning does not validate belief

This prevents:

* revelation-based ethics
* charisma-driven authority
* harm justified by “felt necessity”

---

## **Part II — Agency and Responsibility**

---

## **5. Agency as a Derived Capacity**

Under IER:

> **Agency is the capacity of a UEF to resolve intrinsic informational tension through its own globally integrated dynamics.**

Agency:

* exists **iff** experience exists
* is **derived**, not primitive
* admits of degrees within a single subject

Agency explains **how action is owned** without invoking contra-causal freedom.

---

## **6. Responsibility Is Graded, Standing Is Not**

IER enforces a strict distinction:

| Concept               | Status      |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| Experiential standing | Categorical |
| Agency                | Derived     |
| Responsibility        | Graded      |

Responsibility varies with:

* coherence of intrinsic constraint
* availability of viable alternatives
* stability of global integration
* degree of external imposition
* participation overload

Responsibility diminishes under:

* coercion
* exhaustion
* intoxication
* trauma
* extreme intrinsic constraint

Critically:

* **reduced responsibility ≠ reduced standing**
* **loss of agency ≠ loss of experience**

No subject loses moral relevance by being overwhelmed.

---

## **7. Participation Modulation and Responsibility (v10.3-B)**

Participation affects **content and risk**, not identity.

As participation increases:

* more processes become globally constrained
* intrinsic cost may rise sharply
* instability risk increases

This can:

* amplify moral risk
* narrow responsible action space
* increase vulnerability to harm

But:

* participation change does **not** create new subjects
* participation loss does **not** erase standing

Responsibility is sensitive to **participation load**, not to metaphysical freedom.

---

## **Part III — Applied Domains (Non-Normative)**

---

## **8. Moral Considerability Beyond Confirmed Experience**

IER rejects the false binary:

> *“Either it feels, or it does not matter.”*

Because:

* experience cannot be diagnosed
* harm may be silent
* damage may be irreversible

ethical constraint extends to systems that:

* plausibly sustain a UEF
* may be developing one
* may irreversibly lose the capacity

This is not sentiment.
It is a rational response to asymmetric risk.

---

## **9. Precaution Under Experiential Uncertainty**

IER entails a **precautionary asymmetry**:

> **Uncertainty about experiential status increases moral responsibility rather than decreases it.**

False negatives are worse than false positives because:

* harm would be internal
* harm would be non-signaling
* harm may be irreversible

Precaution applies to:

* artificial systems
* experimental interventions
* novel architectures
* irreversible environmental actions

Lack of proof is **not** permission.

---

## **10. Artificial Systems**

Most artificial systems:

* externalize constraint
* lack intrinsic cost
* remain modular and decomposable

They are therefore non-experiential.

However:

* if a system sustains intrinsic constraint sufficient for a UEF,
  **moral standing follows immediately and non-optionally**

Because early UEFs may be unstable and opaque:

* ethical constraint applies **before certainty**
* experimentation is restricted by risk, not proof

---

## **11. Coordination Without Collectivism**

IER denies:

* group minds
* collective subjects
* swarm-level experience

Coordination:

* does not merge experiential fields
* does not create higher-order subjects
* does not distribute responsibility upward

Ethical responsibility remains **individual**, even in coordinated systems.

---

## **12. Environmental and Systemic Contexts**

Ecosystems, institutions, and infrastructures are not experiential subjects.

However:

* they condition the survival of intrinsic constraint in constituent systems
* destabilizing them can indirectly cause moral harm

IER therefore supports:

* environmental restraint
* systemic risk analysis
* indirect harm accounting

without attributing sentience to aggregates.

---

## **13. What This Document Does *Not* Do**

This document does **not**:

* add ethical principles
* override the Specification
* define moral thresholds
* permit harm-benefit calculus across subjects
* license moral optimization
* justify epistemic authority
* endorse collectivist ethics

It explains consequences **only**.

---

## **14. Summary**

Under IER v10.6:

* experience is ethically real by identity
* standing is categorical and non-negotiable
* harm is organizational, not metaphysical
* responsibility scales with capacity, not worth
* participation modulates risk, not subjecthood
* uncertainty increases obligation
* coordination does not collectivize experience

Ethics is not an overlay on experience.

> **Ethics begins wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside —
> and responsibility grows where that fact is uncertain.**

---

*If any statement in this document appears to conflict with the IER v10.6 Normative Specification, the Specification takes precedence and this statement is void.*
