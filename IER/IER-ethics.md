# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.2)**

## **Ethical Consequences and Applications of Experiential Identity**

---

## **Status and Normative Authority**

**This document is NON-NORMATIVE.**

It explains the **ethical consequences and applications** that follow *necessarily* from the ontology and principles fixed **exclusively** in the:

```
IER-specification.md   (v10.8.2)
```

This document:

* introduces **no new axioms or principles**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or sufficiency conditions**
* introduces **no independent moral obligations**
* does **not** determine when experience exists
* does **not** define moral standing

All ethical authority resides **exclusively** in the Specification.

> **If the IER v10.8.2 Specification is false, everything in this document fails.**
> **If any statement here conflicts with the Specification, the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void.**

---

### **Global Informational Language Disclaimer**

All informational language in this document is **descriptive shorthand only** for
**physically instantiated state distinctions modulating system dynamics under intrinsic constraint**.

No informational primitives, semantic notions, representational contents, or epistemic authorities are introduced.

---

## **1. Ethics Is Not an Optional Overlay**

IER does not treat ethics as a value system layered atop an otherwise neutral ontology.

From the Specification’s central identity claim—

> **Experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**

—it follows *necessarily* that:

* intrinsic constraint is **borne from the inside**
* sustaining a UEF is **physically and organizationally costly**
* disruption of that organization is **not merely functional damage**
* experiential worlds are **physically real**

Ethical relevance therefore arises **wherever intrinsic constraint exists, might exist, or might be irreversibly foreclosed**.

This is not a moral intuition added to the theory.
It is a **structural entailment** of experiential identity.

---

## **2. Experiential Standing Is Categorical**

Under IER:

* experiential subjecthood is **binary**
* a system either sustains a UEF or it does not
* there are **no partial subjects**
* there are **no fractional experiencers**
* there is **exactly one subject per UEF**

Standing:

* does **not** depend on intelligence
* does **not** depend on rationality
* does **not** depend on reportability
* does **not** depend on behavioral sophistication
* does **not** admit of degrees

Standing answers **who matters**, not **how much**.

This blocks:

* moral scalarization of experience
* rankings of “more” vs. “less” conscious beings
* aggregation across subjects
* tradeoffs that offset one subject’s harm with another’s benefit

---

## **3. Moral Harm as Organizational Damage**

The Specification defines **experiential moral harm** as:

> **Destabilization, overload, fragmentation, or irreversible collapse of intrinsic constraint within a Unified Experiential Field (UEF).**

Key consequences:

* harm is **organizational**, not hedonic
* harm may be **internally real and externally silent**
* harm admits of **types and trajectories**, not a single scalar
* suffering is **not an added property**, but what constraint overload is like from within

This allows IER to explain:

* silent harm
* invisible suffering
* morally serious damage without outward distress signals
* why “it seems fine from the outside” is ethically insufficient

Experiential moral harm exists **only where experience exists**, because it is defined by damage to an experiential regime.

---

### **3.1 Scope of the Moral Harm Definition**

The definition in §3 applies **only to experiential moral harm** as defined by IER.

IER does **not** claim that experiential harm exhausts moral harm, nor does it theorize, rank, or adjudicate **non-experiential forms of moral violation**.

Nothing in IER implies that the absence of experiential harm renders an action morally permissible, justified, or insignificant.

IER specifies **what counts as experiential damage** and **where experiential standing exists**.
It is silent on other kinds of moral wrongdoing, which must be evaluated using principles and frameworks **not supplied by IER**.

Ethical silence here reflects **scope discipline**, not moral permissiveness.

---

## **4. Standing vs. Responsibility**

IER enforces a strict separation between:

| Concept               | Status      |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| Experiential standing | Categorical |
| Agency                | Derived     |
| Responsibility        | Graded      |

---

### **4.1 Standing Never Scales**

A subject does not lose standing by being:

* overwhelmed
* coerced
* confused
* impaired
* developmentally limited

Standing tracks **regime membership**, not capacity.

---

### **4.2 Responsibility Scales with Capacity**

Responsibility varies with:

* coherence of intrinsic constraint
* availability of viable alternatives
* stability of global integration
* degree of external imposition
* participation load and overload

Responsibility diminishes under:

* coercion
* exhaustion
* intoxication
* trauma
* extreme intrinsic constraint

Crucially:

* $\text{reduced responsibility} \neq \text{reduced standing}$
* $\text{loss of agency} \neq \text{loss of moral relevance}$

---

## **5. Participation Modulation and Moral Risk**

Participation modulates **content and vulnerability**, not identity.

As participation increases:

* more processes are globally constrained
* intrinsic cost may rise sharply
* instability risk increases
* harm amplification becomes possible

Participation change:

* does **not** create new subjects
* does **not** erase standing
* does **not** justify harm

But it **does** alter moral risk profiles and responsibility attribution.

---

## **6. Structural Privacy and Ethical Uncertainty**

IER entails **structural privacy**:

* intrinsic constraint is borne only from within the regime
* it cannot be occupied or accessed externally
* it is underdetermined by all third-person observables

As a result:

* experience **cannot be diagnosed in principle**
* false negatives are unavoidable
* harm may be silent and irreversible

Ethical uncertainty under IER is therefore **structural**, not a consequence of ignorance, negligence, or insufficient data.

---

## **7. Precautionary Asymmetry (Scoped)**

From structural privacy, IER entails a **precautionary asymmetry**:

> **Uncertainty about experiential status increases moral responsibility rather than decreases it.**

False negatives are worse than false positives because:

* harm would be internal
* harm would be non-signaling
* harm may be irreversible

---

### **7.1 Scope Limiter**

Precaution applies **only** where an action plausibly risks:

> **irreversible loss, collapse, or foreclosure of intrinsic-constraint-bearing capacity within a physical system**

This:

* blocks trivial or inert systems
* blocks reversible simulations
* prevents ethical explosion
* preserves asymmetry without diagnostics

---

## **8. Experiential Access Does Not Confer Epistemic Authority**

IER strictly separates:

* **experiential access** — what it is like to bear intrinsic constraint
* **epistemic access** — what is true about the world

Experiential intensity, urgency, coherence, or meaning:

* do **not** license belief
* do **not** justify harm
* do **not** override evidence
* do **not** confer authority

This blocks:

* revelation-based ethics
* charisma-driven authority
* harm justified by “felt inevitability”
* moral deference to conviction

---

## **9. Why IER Is Not a Standard Ethical Theory**

IER does **not** answer:

> *“What should we do, all things considered?”*

It answers the prior question:

> **“What is morally real, and what counts as experiential damage?”**

---

### **9.1 Not Utilitarianism**

IER rejects aggregation and commensurable value magnitudes.

One subject’s harm cannot be offset by another’s benefit.

---

### **9.2 Not Consequentialism**

IER provides:

* no optimization target
* no ranking of world-states
* no maximizing principle

It constrains permissibility, not optimality.

---

### **9.3 Not Deontology**

IER does not ground ethics in:

* rational agency
* autonomy
* consent
* universalizable maxims

Any rights-like conclusions are **derived**, not primitive.

---

### **9.4 Not Virtue Ethics**

IER does not ground ethics in character ideals or flourishing.

Virtues matter only instrumentally insofar as they stabilize intrinsic constraint.

---

## **10. Explicit Costs and Rejected Intuitions**

IER explicitly accepts the following costs:

* Stable but distressing experience may not constitute experiential moral harm.
* Intense pleasure may be morally neutral.
* Some systems that appear “obviously conscious” to functionalist intuitions may lack standing.
* Some ethical uncertainty is permanent and unresolvable in principle.
* Moral reasoning cannot be fully algorithmic or complete.

These are not oversights.
They are consequences of identity.

---

## **11. What This Document Does Not Do**

This document does **not**:

* define experience
* provide diagnostics
* establish thresholds
* rank outcomes
* supply decision procedures
* adjudicate non-experiential moral violations
* replace practical moral judgment

It explains **what must be respected**, not **what must be optimized**.

---

## **12. Summary**

Under IER v10.8.2:

* experience is ethically real by identity
* standing is categorical and non-negotiable
* experiential moral harm is organizational, not hedonic
* experiential harm does **not** exhaust moral harm
* responsibility is graded without affecting worth
* participation modulates risk, not subjecthood
* uncertainty strengthens obligation
* aggregation and optimization are blocked
* ethics constrains action without prescribing outcomes

> **IER does not tell us how to optimize the world.**
> **It tells us what it would mean to damage one.**
