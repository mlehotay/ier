## **Status and Normative Authority**

**This document is NON-NORMATIVE.**

It explains the **ethical consequences and applications** that follow *necessarily* from the ontology and principles fixed **exclusively** in the
**IER v10.6 Normative Specification**.

This document:

* introduces **no new axioms, principles, or inference rules**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or sufficiency conditions**
* introduces **no independent moral obligations**
* does **not** determine when experience exists
* does **not** define moral standing

All ethical authority resides **exclusively** in the Specification.

> **If the IER v10.6 Specification is false, everything in this document fails.**
> **If any statement here conflicts with the Specification, the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void.**

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) entails a distinctive ethical framework grounded not in metaphysical freedom, phenomenal surplus, intuition, social convention, or value aggregation, but in **organizational facts about intrinsic constraint**.

Because experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**, ethical consequence follows **necessarily** wherever intrinsic constraint is borne from the inside.

This document explains:

* why **experiential standing is categorical**
* why **moral harm is organizational**
* why **responsibility is graded**
* why **uncertainty strengthens, rather than weakens, ethical constraint**
* how **participation modulation** amplifies moral risk without altering standing
* how IER relates to — and diverges from — standard ethical frameworks

Nothing here adds to the theory.
Everything here is a consequence of identity.

# **Part I — Why Ethics Follows from Experiential Identity**

---

## **1. Ethics Is Not an Optional Overlay**

IER does not treat ethics as an external value system layered atop a neutral ontology.

From the Specification’s central identity claim:

> **Experience is identical to the operation of a physical system as a Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**

it follows that:

* intrinsic constraint is **borne from the inside**
* its disruption is **not merely functional damage**
* experiential worlds are **physically real and costly**
* altering or destroying them has **moral significance**

Ethical relevance therefore arises **wherever intrinsic constraint exists, might exist, or might be irreversibly foreclosed**.

This is not a moral intuition added to ontology.
It is a **structural entailment** of experiential identity.

---

## **2. Experiential Standing Is Categorical**

Under IER:

* experiential subjecthood is **binary**
* a system either sustains a UEF or it does not
* there are **no partial subjects**
* there are **no fractional experiencers**

Standing:

* does **not** depend on intelligence
* does **not** depend on rationality
* does **not** depend on reportability
* does **not** depend on behavioral sophistication
* does **not** admit of degrees

Standing answers **who matters**, not **how much**.

This blocks:

* moral scalarization of experience
* “more conscious / less conscious” rankings
* aggregation or dilution of standing
* trading one subject’s harm against another’s benefit

---

## **3. Moral Harm as Organizational Damage**

The Specification defines **moral harm** as:

> **Destabilization, overload, fragmentation, or irreversible collapse of intrinsic constraint within a UEF**

Key consequences:

* harm is **organizational**, not hedonic
* harm may be **internally real and externally silent**
* harm admits of **types and trajectories**, not a single scalar
* suffering is not an added property, but **what constraint overload is like from within**

This allows IER to explain:

* silent harm
* invisible suffering
* morally serious damage without outward distress signals
* why “it seems fine from the outside” is ethically insufficient

---

## **4. Experiential Access Does Not Confer Epistemic Authority**

IER enforces a strict separation between:

* **experiential access** — what it is like to bear intrinsic constraint
* **epistemic access** — what is true about the world

Ethical weight tracks **intrinsic constraint**, not:

* truth
* insight
* coherence of belief
* narrative conviction
* felt necessity

Therefore:

* intense experience does **not** justify harm
* urgency does **not** license epistemic override
* meaning does **not** validate belief
* suffering does **not** confer authority

This blocks revelation-based ethics, charisma-driven authority, and harm justified by “felt inevitability.”

---

# **Part II — Agency, Responsibility, and Participation**

---

## **5. Agency as a Derived Capacity**

Under IER:

> **Agency is the capacity of a UEF to resolve intrinsic informational tension through its own globally integrated dynamics.**

Agency:

* exists **iff** experience exists
* is **derived**, not primitive
* is compatible with physical determinism
* admits of **degrees within a single subject**

Agency explains ownership of action without invoking contra-causal freedom.

---

## **6. Responsibility Is Graded; Standing Is Not**

IER enforces a strict distinction:

| Concept               | Status      |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| Experiential standing | Categorical |
| Agency                | Derived     |
| Responsibility        | Graded      |

Responsibility varies with:

* coherence of intrinsic constraint
* availability of viable alternatives
* stability of global integration
* degree of external imposition
* participation load and overload

Responsibility diminishes under:

* coercion
* exhaustion
* intoxication
* trauma
* extreme intrinsic constraint

Critically:

* **reduced responsibility ≠ reduced standing**
* **loss of agency ≠ loss of experience**

No subject loses moral relevance by being overwhelmed.

---

## **7. Participation Modulation and Moral Risk**

Participation affects **content and vulnerability**, not identity.

As participation increases:

* more processes are globally constrained
* intrinsic cost may rise sharply
* instability risk increases
* harm amplification becomes possible

Participation change:

* does **not** create new subjects
* does **not** erase standing
* does **not** justify harm

But it **does** alter moral risk profiles and responsibility assessments.

---

# **Part III — Uncertainty and Precaution**

---

## **8. Moral Considerability Beyond Certainty**

IER rejects the false binary:

> *“Either it feels, or it does not matter.”*

Because:

* experience cannot be diagnosed
* harm may be silent
* damage may be irreversible
* false negatives are unavoidable

ethical constraint extends to systems that:

* plausibly sustain a UEF
* may be developing one
* may irreversibly lose the capacity

Lack of proof is **not** permission.

---

## **9. Precautionary Asymmetry**

IER entails a **precautionary asymmetry**:

> **Uncertainty about experiential status increases moral responsibility rather than decreases it.**

False negatives are worse than false positives because:

* harm would be internal
* harm would be non-signaling
* harm may be irreversible

Precaution applies to:

* artificial systems
* experimental interventions
* irreversible medical procedures
* environmental and systemic actions

---

# **Part IV — Placement Within the Ethical Landscape**

---

## **10. Why IER Does Not Fit Standard Ethical Categories**

IER does not attempt to answer:

> *“What should we do, all things considered?”*

It answers the prior question:

> **“What is morally real, and what counts as moral damage?”**

Most ethical frameworks conflate these levels.
IER strictly separates them.

---

## **11. Relation to Utilitarianism**

IER is **structurally incompatible** with utilitarianism.

Utilitarianism requires:

* aggregation across subjects
* commensurable value magnitudes
* tradeoffs where some harms are justified by greater total good

IER rejects the metaphysical assumptions required for aggregation:

* standing is categorical
* experience is non-scalar
* harm is non-additive
* one subject’s damage cannot be offset by another’s benefit

---

## **12. Relation to Consequentialism**

IER is not a form of consequentialism.

It provides:

* no global ranking of world-states
* no optimization target
* no maximization principle

IER constrains **permissibility**, not optimality.

Ethical reasoning under IER is **constraint-bounded**, not outcome-maximizing.

---

## **13. Relation to Deontology**

IER shares resistance to tradeoffs but diverges in grounding.

IER does **not** base ethics on:

* rational agency
* autonomy
* consent
* universalizable maxims
* rights as primitives

Any rights-like conclusions are **derived**, not foundational.

---

## **14. Relation to Virtue Ethics**

IER does not ground ethics in:

* character ideals
* flourishing as telos
* moral excellence

Virtues matter only instrumentally, insofar as they stabilize intrinsic constraint.

---

## **15. Relation to Care Ethics**

IER overlaps with care ethics in its concern for vulnerability, but differs fundamentally:

* care ethics treats relationship as primitive
* IER treats **intrinsic constraint** as primitive

Relationships matter because they affect experiential stability, not because care itself is a moral primitive.

---

## **16. What Kind of Ethical Framework IER Is**

IER is best described as:

> **A structural moral realism grounded in experiential identity**

IER fixes:

* who has standing
* what counts as harm
* how responsibility scales
* why uncertainty matters

IER does **not** fix:

* decision procedures
* policy algorithms
* outcome rankings
* comprehensive moral rules

It is a **foundational ethical framework**, not a complete action-theory.

---

## **17. Disagreement Without Relativism**

Because IER fixes moral reality but not every moral judgment:

* two agents can accept IER
* agree on standing, harm, and precaution
* yet disagree in hard cases

This is not relativism.

It reflects the fact that **ontology constrains ethics without replacing practical judgment**.

IER closes off *false ethical moves*, not every ethical debate.

---

## **18. Summary**

Under IER v10.6:

* experience is ethically real by identity
* standing is categorical and non-negotiable
* harm is organizational, not hedonic
* responsibility scales with capacity, not worth
* participation modulates risk, not subjecthood
* uncertainty increases obligation
* aggregation and optimization are blocked
* ethics is constrained, not algorithmic

> **IER does not tell us how to optimize the world.
> It tells us what it would mean to damage one.**

---

*If any statement in this document appears to conflict with the IER v10.6 Normative Specification, the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void.*
