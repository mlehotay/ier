# **IER Identity Costs: A Theory-Internal Orientation**

### **NON-CANONICAL · NON-CORPUS · NOT READER-FACING**

---

## **Status Declaration (Interpretive Constraint)**

This document is **not canonical** and **not part of the IER corpus**.

Under the rule stated in `IER-manifest.md`:

> **Non-Corpus Material** — Any file not explicitly enumerated in the manifest is **non-corpus**, regardless of repository location or filename.

Accordingly:

* This document introduces **no ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical commitments**
* It has **no interpretive authority**
* It may **not** be cited to resolve disputes about IER
* If any statement here conflicts with a corpus document—especially `IER-specification.md` or `IER-critics.md`—**the corpus document takes precedence and this document is void at the point of conflict**

This document exists **solely for theory-internal orientation and sanity-checking**.

---

## **Why This Document Exists**

`IER-a-priori.md` maps the **a priori objection landscape** faced by *any* identity theory of consciousness.

`IER-critics.md` adjudicates those objections **as applied to IER**, distinguishing:

* internal threats
* accepted costs
* and disagreements that reflect incompatible starting points

This document does **neither**.

Instead, it answers a different, strictly internal question:

> *“If we temporarily suspend meta-theoretical restraint and speak plainly, what is IER actually prepared to say in response to these pressures?”*

The answer is not meant to persuade, reassure, or defend.
It is meant to verify **self-consistency**.

---

## **Why This Document Is Not Reader-Facing**

This document must not be reader-facing for **structural reasons**, not rhetorical ones.

### 1. It collapses levels that must remain distinct

IER enforces a hard separation between:

| Level                        | Proper document        |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| A priori pressure mapping    | `IER-a-priori.md`      |
| Theory-specific adjudication | `IER-critics.md`       |
| Normative commitments        | `IER-specification.md` |
| Reader orientation           | Part III documents     |

This document **deliberately violates that separation** by:

* taking positions without first diagnosing
* answering objections without restating their neutrality
* speaking from *inside* the identity posture rather than about it

That is acceptable **only** as an internal mirror.

Making it reader-facing would blur the architecture and invite misinterpretation.

---

### 2. Responding directly to a priori attacks is a category error

The objections cataloged in `IER-a-priori.md` are **not theory-level criticisms**.

They are:

* objections to **identity as a metaphysical strategy**
* expressions of dissatisfaction with **explanatory termination**
* demands for features identity theories deny *by construction*

To respond to them directly—as if they were ordinary empirical or theoretical objections—is to grant a false premise:

> that identity theories owe answers *within the same evaluative frame* that generated the objections.

They do not.

The correct response to many a priori identity attacks is not:

> “Here is how we satisfy that demand”

but:

> “That demand already rules out identity.”

This document violates that discipline **on purpose**, in order to show what IER would say *if it did answer anyway*.

That is precisely why it must not be taken as part of the official dialectic.

---

### 3. Reader-facing documents must preserve diagnostic neutrality

IER’s reader-facing materials are governed by a strict rule:

> **They may explain disagreement, but must not pre-empt it.**

This document pre-empts disagreement.

It says, in effect:

* *Yes, we accept that cost.*
* *No, we do not try to fix that.*
* *If that is unacceptable, identity is not your framework.*

That stance is legitimate—but **only after** the reader has been oriented, not while they are still being aligned.

---

## **What This Document Is (and Is Not)**

**This document is:**

* a stress test
* a coherence check
* a theory-internal voice memo
* a way of asking “do we actually mean this?”

**This document is not:**

* an argument for identity
* a rebuttal to critics
* a clarification of misunderstandings
* a substitute for `IER-critics.md`
* a guide for new readers

---

## **IER’s Plain-Speech Position on the A Priori Objections**

What follows is **not neutral** and **not diagnostic**.

It is what IER says **once identity is already accepted**.

---

### **1. Identity Is Not an Explanatory Ascent**

IER accepts explanatory termination at identity.

There is no further story about why experience feels like something, because experience is not an effect of the regime—it *is* the regime.

Demanding more explanation presupposes non-identity.

**Accepted cost:** no “why-it-feels-like” answer.

---

### **2. The Explanatory Gap Is Permanent**

IER does not aim to close the explanatory gap.

First-person occupancy and third-person description are structurally incommensurable.

No amount of knowledge substitutes for being the system.

**Accepted cost:** the gap does not close.

---

### **3. Experience Has No Epistemic Authority**

Experience is real, structured, unified, and meaningful.

None of those features license belief, truth, or metaphysical inference.

Phenomenal transparency is rejected as an evidential principle.

**Accepted cost:** experience feels authoritative without being so.

---

### **4. Realizability Is Restricted**

IER rejects both substrate chauvinism and functional permissiveness.

Experience is identical to a specific organizational regime.

Some substrates may instantiate it. Most will not.

**Accepted cost:** exclusion of many intuitively “conscious” systems.

---

### **5. There Is No Selector**

UEFs are not chosen.

They exist when intrinsic constraint becomes globally unavoidable and internally borne.

There is no further selection rule, and no diagnostic resolution of borderline cases.

**Accepted cost:** sharp ontology, permanent epistemic uncertainty.

---

### **6. No Required Reconstruction of Phenomenology**

Identity does not entail translation manuals or recoverable mappings.

Structural correspondence may exist, but accessibility is not guaranteed.

**Accepted cost:** explanation without reconstruction.

---

### **7. Conceivability Has No Modal Force**

IER rejects conceivability as evidence of metaphysical possibility.

Identity is treated as a posteriori and necessity-constraining.

**Accepted cost:** rejection of a dominant philosophical intuition.

---

### **8. Unity Does Not Imply Simplicity**

Experiential unity arises from global constraint, not architectural homogeneity.

Fragmented mechanisms can sustain a single experiential regime.

**Accepted cost:** introspection is not a guide to architecture.

---

## **What Counts as Success for IER (Internally)**

IER does not claim success by satisfying intuitions.

It claims success if:

1. the identity claim is coherent
2. the exclusion arguments hold
3. no weaker organization suffices
4. ethical consequences follow without contradiction
5. nothing disallowed is smuggled back in

That is all.

---

## **Closing Clarification**

If the positions stated here are unacceptable, that is not a misunderstanding.

It is a genuine disagreement about **what kind of explanation is acceptable in the phenomenal case**.

This document exists to make that disagreement visible **to ourselves**, not to settle it for others.

That is why it must remain **non-corpus**, **non-canonical**, and **not reader-facing**.
