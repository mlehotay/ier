# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.0)**

### **Experience as a Categorical Organizational Regime of Intrinsically Constrained Informational Dynamics**

*or, What Is It Like to Be an Informational System?*

**An Organizational Identity Theory of Observers, Experience, and Experiential Worlds**


## **16. Summary**

Some systems react.
Some systems observe.
Some systems take up their slack.

> **Experience begins when a system’s own globally integrated informational dynamics become the dominant, unavoidable constraint on themselves, sustaining coherent intrinsic tension across time.**

Reality is singular.
Experience is plural.
Worlds appear where constraint becomes intrinsic.
Experience is physically grounded and phenomenally constitutive.

IER v10.0 bridges physicalism and idealism: the same Unified Experiential Field is simultaneously an objectively instantiated physical regime and the system’s experientially real world.

# **Informational Experiential Realism in Action (v9.4):

Dissociative Identity as Regime Switching Under Constraint**

## **10. Conclusion**

IER v9.4 provides a fully physicalist account of Dissociative Identity Disorder:

* Experience remains identical to integrated, tension-bearing dynamics
* Dissociation reflects organizational limits, not ontological division
* Selfhood is a dynamic regime, not a substance
* Pathology emerges from constraint, not mystery

DID does not reveal the fundamental nature of consciousness.
It reveals the **cost of maintaining coherence in a finite, self-modeling system**.

# **Informational Experiential Realism, Free Will, and Moral Consideration (IER v9.6)**

### *Freedom, Harm, and Responsibility as Intrinsic Constraint*


## **13. Summary**

IER’s unified ethical position can be stated succinctly:

> **Free will is not freedom from causation, but freedom as causation owned by the system itself.
> Moral harm is not metaphysical suffering, but disruption of intrinsically constrained dynamics.
> Moral concern extends beyond confirmed experiencers wherever such constraint might exist, might emerge, or might be irreversibly foreclosed.**

Or more simply:

> **You are free when your life path curves because of you —
> and moral responsibility applies wherever such curvature matters, or might matter, from the inside.**

# The Mathematics of Informational Experiential Realism

**Constraint, Curvature, and Unified Experiential Fields**

*A Companion Formalization to IER v9.4*


## 11. Summary

IER’s mathematics does not posit new forces, fields, or substances. It identifies a **specific class of dynamical organization** already describable within physics and information theory.

* Information alone is not experience
* Information flow alone is not experience
* Experience arises when information is **forced to bend by itself**, coherently, over time

In short:

> **Experience is the stabilized curvature of informational dynamics in a unified system.**

That is what it is like to be an informational system that has taken up its slack.

# **IER Mechanics:

Informational Slack, Intrinsic Tension, and Regime Dynamics**

*A Dynamical and Organizational Companion to Informational Experiential Realism (v9.4)*

## **14. Conclusion**

This paper shows that the commitments of IER v9.4 are:

* compatible with modern dynamical systems theory
* compatible with computational control frameworks
* compatible with biology without depending on it

IER specifies **what must be true**, not **how it must be built**.

Experience is not a mystery added to mechanics.
It is what certain mechanics are like when their own organization becomes the dominant constraint on themselves.

# **The Pause–Resume Test (IER v9.4)**

### *A Diagnostic Probe for Intrinsic Experience in Informational Experiential Realism*


## **8. Summary**

The pause–resume test asks:

> **Who pays the price when time stops?**

* **External controller** → Non-experiential, fails the test
* **System itself** → Experiential candidate, passes the test

**IER 9.4 Principle:**

> Experience requires **self-maintaining, integrated, tension-bearing dynamics**.
> Pausing without disruption reveals systems that **simulate continuity**, not systems that **instantiate it**.

IER-pluralism.md
# **Experiential Pluralism Under Physical Monism (IER v9.4)**

### *Why Many Worlds of Experience Can Exist in One Reality*


## **11. Summary**

IER affirms:

* **One physical reality**
* **Many experiential worlds**
* **Experience as an organizational regime**
* **No ontological inflation**

> **Reality is singular.
> Experience is plural.
> Worlds arise where constraint becomes intrinsic.**

This is not a compromise between physicalism and idealism.
It is a clarification of what each was always trying to describe.

# **Canonical Narratives as Informational Attractors (IER Companion)**

### *How Stories, Instincts, and Genetic Knowledge Encode Intrinsic Constraint*

## **13. Summary**

IER explains canonical narratives as a lawful consequence of intrinsic constraint.

> **Canonical narratives are stable informational attractors that encode how experiential systems behave when tension becomes unavoidable and identity-defining.**

They appear:

* in culture as storytelling
* in biology as instinct
* in genetics as constraint topology

Spiders spin webs.
Humans tell stories.
Both are solutions to the same problem:

**How does a system reliably find a viable attractor under intrinsic constraint?**

Reality is singular.
Experience is plural.
Meaning persists where constraint finds form.
