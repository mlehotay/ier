## **Status, Scope, and Canon Position**

* **Tier:** T2 — Elaboration and Application
* **Status:** Explanatory, non-normative
* Introduces **no new ontological primitives**
* Introduces **no diagnostics, metrics, or engineering guidance**
* All authority derives exclusively from:

  * `IER-specification.md`
  * `IER-dynamics.md`
  * `IER-agency.md`
  * `IER-propaganda.md`

**Purpose of this document**

> To explain **suggestion as a structural phenomenon** under Informational Experiential Realism:
> how minimal external perturbations can bias resolution **without belief change, command, or coercion**, and why such effects are fragile, context-dependent, and ethically asymmetrical.

## **1. Orientation: Why “Suggestion” Is Persistently Misunderstood**

* Common framings:

  * suggestion as persuasion
  * suggestion as belief manipulation
  * suggestion as hidden command
  * suggestion as weakness or gullibility
* Why these framings fail under IER:

  * beliefs are not control variables
  * commands require agency recruitment
  * weakness is not an architectural category
* Reframing question:

  > *How can action shift without belief, deliberation, or loss of unity?*

## **2. Structural Preliminaries**

### **2.1 Reminder: Resolution Under Intrinsic Constraint**

* Resolution is continuous and unavoidable
* Action emerges from traversal of admissible futures
* Agency is **owned resolution**, not resolution per se

(Brief reminder only; no re-derivation)

---

### **2.2 What Suggestion Is *Not***

Explicit non-claims (misuse containment):

* Not belief insertion
* Not representational content transfer
* Not semantic influence
* Not partial mind control
* Not sub-agent activation
* Not external ownership of action

---

## **3. Definition (Descriptive, Non-Normative)**

> **Suggestion** is a **low-magnitude external perturbation** that biases the relative viability of already-admissible futures **at the moment of resolution**, without recruiting global deliberative participation.

Key features:

* operates **locally**, not globally
* alters **cost geometry**, not content
* leaves UEF dominance intact
* succeeds only when slack is present

---

## **4. Necessary Structural Preconditions for Suggestion**

### **4.1 Presence of Informational Slack**

* Multiple admissible futures must remain open
* No slack → suggestion impossible
* Excess slack → suggestion dissipates

(Reference to `IER-slack.md` conceptually, without diagnostics)

---

### **4.2 Active but Low Intrinsic Constraint**

* System must be resolving something
* Too little constraint → no uptake
* Too much constraint → suggestion overridden or rejected

---

### **4.3 Alignment with Existing Attractors**

* Suggestion cannot introduce new trajectories
* It can only bias trajectories already viable
* Explains narrow domain of effectiveness

---

## **5. Why Suggestion Feels Non-Agentive**

* Suggestion succeeds by **avoiding agency recruitment**
* No conflict → no deliberation
* Resolution occurs smoothly and locally
* From the inside:

  * “It felt natural”
  * “I don’t know why I did that”
* From the outside:

  * behavior appears spontaneous

Crucially:

> **Agency is not removed; it is simply not invoked.**

## **6. Suggestion vs Related Phenomena**

### **6.1 Suggestion vs Persuasion**

* persuasion reorganizes narrative coherence
* suggestion bypasses narrative entirely

---

### **6.2 Suggestion vs Propaganda**

* propaganda deforms choice space over time
* suggestion biases a single resolution event
* propaganda accumulates; suggestion evaporates

(Explicit cross-reference alignment with `IER-propaganda.md`)

---

### **6.3 Suggestion vs Coercion**

* coercion collapses admissible futures
* suggestion preserves alternatives
* difference is magnitude and reversibility, not kind

---

## **7. Fragility and Failure Modes of Suggestion**

Why suggestion is unreliable by design:

* reflection recruits global participation
* scrutiny dissolves local bias
* pressure converts suggestion into reactance
* repetition can exhaust slack and flip regime

Suggestion fails structurally when:

* agency is forced online
* constraint escalates
* trust asymmetry becomes salient

---

## **8. Ethical Orientation (Non-Normative Pointer)**

* Suggestion is morally neutral **in isolation**
* Moral risk arises from:

  * asymmetry
  * repetition
  * concealment
  * coupling with constraint exhaustion
* Why IER treats suggestion as ethically lightweight **until it isn’t**

* `IER-ethics.md`
* `IER-harm.md`
* `IER-gaslighting.md`

No prescriptions, no permissions.

## **9. What This Article Does *Not* Do**

Explicit exclusions:

* no techniques
* no optimization strategies
* no therapeutic instructions
* no “how to suggest”
* no defensive training protocols
* no empirical tests

---

## **10. Summary**

* Suggestion is a **structural bias**, not belief control
* It operates only at **resolution boundaries**
* It preserves unity, ownership, and subjecthood
* Its power is precisely its fragility
* Its danger lies in accumulation, not intensity

## **Intermission — Constraint Aphorism**

> *A system does not follow a suggestion.
> It settles where the slope is shallowest.*
