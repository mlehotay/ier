# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v5)**

### *A Unified Framework for Observers, Experience, and Consciousness*

---

## **Overview**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** is a theory of mind and consciousness grounded in **physical realism** and **informational organization**. Reality exists independently of observers and is governed entirely by physical processes. Observers do not create or co-create reality; they are **physical systems embedded within it** that construct internal informational models of the world.

Within this framework, minds, observers, and conscious subjects are understood as **informational systems** whose organization enables persistence, self-monitoring, and, in some cases, conscious experience. Consciousness is **real but emergent**, arising when a system’s informational dynamics achieve a particular form of integration, rather than being fundamental to reality.

IER is an **organizational theory**. It specifies what consciousness *is* and *when it occurs*, not what physical substrate it must be made of. Candidate physical and computational implementations, experiential walkthroughs, and comparisons to existing theories are provided in appendices.

---

## **Core Commitments**

### **1. Objective Reality**

Reality exists independently of observation. Physical states, events, and laws unfold regardless of perception or interpretation. Observers do not influence reality through thought or perspective; only **physical interactions among systems** causally affect the world.

Experience interprets reality—it does not alter it.

---

### **2. Observers as Informational Systems**

An **observer** is defined by **informational organization**, not by biology or subjective experience. A system qualifies as an observer when it:

* Persists as a coherent informational pattern over time
* Integrates information across subsystems
* Monitors and updates internal representations of its own state
* Maintains a unified internal perspective from which information is processed

This organization can be instantiated in biological organisms, artificial systems, or distributed physical processes. Consciousness is **not required** for observerhood.

---

### **3. Internal Models and Perspective**

All observers construct **internal informational models** of:

* The external environment
* Their own internal state

These models are:

* Physically instantiated within the system
* Entirely internal and system-bound
* Shaped by structure, history, and constraints

Perspective is a property of **internal informational organization**, not of reality itself. Different observers may model the same reality differently without changing it.

---

### **4. Consciousness and the Phenomenal Information Layer (PIL)**

Conscious experience arises in observers whose informational dynamics form a **Phenomenal Information Layer (PIL)**.

PIL is characterized by:

* Recursive access to internal models
* Temporal continuity of informational states
* Integration across subsystems
* Global availability of information for regulation, learning, and action

PIL is **not a module or location**, but a **system-wide operational regime**. When active, the system does not merely process information—it *experiences*.

---

### **5. Qualia**

Qualia are **system-relative informational states**, defined by:

* Their internal structure
* Their degree of integration
* Their accessibility within the system

They are:

* Physically instantiated
* Accessible only to the system itself
* Differentiated by patterns of informational organization

Qualia are **not intrinsic properties of the external world**. Their apparent privacy arises from exclusive internal access, not metaphysical isolation.

---

### **6. Affect and Valence**

Affective states (e.g., pain, pleasure, attraction, aversion) arise from **regulatory informational processes** that:

* Monitor conditions relevant to system stability
* Bias attention, learning, and behavior
* Assign salience and priority to internal states

Affect is **phenomenally real** because it is globally integrated and regulation-relevant. Valence does not add content—it **weights experience**.

---

### **7. Emergence and Constraints**

Consciousness is **emergent but constrained**. It appears only when a system demonstrates:

* High integration
* Recursive self-modeling
* Temporal continuity
* Coordinated access to information for control and regulation

Many complex systems fail to satisfy these constraints and therefore do not experience consciousness.

---

### **9. Reality and Ontology**

IER rejects:

* Mind-dependent existence
* Observer-generated worlds
* Layered ontologies of reality

There is **one objective physical reality**. Conscious experience occurs **within systems embedded in that reality**, not as a separate layer or co-creative force.

---

## **Conclusion**

Informational Experiential Realism provides a unified framework linking physical reality, observerhood, and consciousness. Consciousness is **real but emergent**, arising when information flows through systems capable of integrated self- and world-modeling over time.

Some systems react.
Some systems observe.
Some systems experience.

IER explains **how and why**.

*A comparative discussion situating IER relative to major contemporary theories is provided in Appendix C.*

# **Appendix A**

## **Possible Physical and Computational Implementations of IER**

*A Companion Framework for Mechanisms, Not Metaphysics*

### **Purpose**

This appendix explores **plausible physical and computational mechanisms** capable of instantiating the organizational constraints defined by IER. No specific mechanism is claimed to be necessary or sufficient.

IER remains a theory about **what consciousness is**, not **what it must be made of**.

---

## 1. Standing and Resonant Wave Implementations

### 1.1 Standing Waves as Informational Substrates

Standing waves are dynamically stable interference patterns that persist over time while their components continuously change. They offer several properties well-suited to IER:

* Stability without static storage
* Natural integration across space
* Mode orthogonality
* Robustness to noise
* Graded amplitude and phase

In this framework:

* **Mental contents** correspond to stable wave modes
* **Changes in experience** correspond to transitions between modes
* **Continuity of consciousness** corresponds to persistence of resonant configurations

Standing waves provide a natural candidate for the **phenomenal persistence** required by PIL.

---

### 1.2 Multidimensionality

Standing-wave instantiation is inherently multidimensional:

* Spatial dimensions (distributed neural tissue)
* Frequency dimensions (multiple oscillatory bands)
* Phase relationships (relative timing)
* Functional dimensions (sensory, affective, cognitive)

Experience is not localized to a point but distributed across this multidimensional space.

---

## 2. Traveling Waves and State Transitions

### 2.1 Traveling Waves as Control and Transition Mechanisms

Traveling waves propagate information or control signals across a system. In biological systems they are used for:

* Attention shifts
* Gating of information
* Action initiation
* State transitions (sleep, arousal, affective surges)

Within IER:

* Traveling waves **modulate** PIL
* They reorganize standing-wave configurations
* They initiate experiential transitions rather than constituting experience themselves

They act as **verbs**, not nouns.

---

### 2.2 Thresholded Global Events

Certain traveling-wave phenomena (e.g., affective surges) can cross thresholds that temporarily dominate global informational dynamics. These events:

* Strongly bias learning
* Restructure salience landscapes
* Leave lasting memory traces

Such events are experiential due to their **global integration and regulatory relevance**.

---

## 3. Cortical Columns as Basis Elements

### 3.1 Columns as Local Basis Functions

Cortical columns are not Cartesian coordinates. Instead, they function as:

* Local feature-sensitive basis elements
* Constraints on permissible wave modes
* Anchors for distributed representations

Each column contributes to many informational patterns. No single column “contains” a thought.

---

### 3.2 Implicit Coordinate Systems

The effective coordinate system of the mind is **relational**, not geometric. It is defined by:

* Connectivity topology
* Synaptic weight distributions
* Preferred frequencies
* Phase relationships
* Cross-frequency coupling

Coordinates emerge from relationships among components, not absolute position.

---

## 4. Cross-Frequency Coupling as Experiential Structure

### 4.1 Binding Across Timescales

Cross-frequency coupling allows slower oscillations to organize faster ones, enabling:

* Working memory
* Narrative continuity
* Hierarchical representation
* Temporal integration

This provides the **grammar** of experience—how contents relate and unfold.

---

### 4.2 Temporal Reference Frames

Slower oscillations function as reference frames within which faster informational elements are indexed. This creates:

* A subjective sense of temporal flow
* Discrete yet continuous experiential structure
* Context-dependent interpretation of content

---

## 5. Affective and Valence Dynamics

### 5.1 Affective Waves as Regulatory Signals

Affective states correspond to system-wide informational signals that:

* Encode relevance to system stability
* Bias attention and learning
* Modulate future action selection

They are experiential because they are **globally accessible** and **regulation-relevant**.

---

### 5.2 Valence as Informational Weighting

Valence does not add content—it weights it.

Within IER:

* Valence adjusts the “gain” of informational pathways
* It reshapes the experiential landscape
* It influences which patterns stabilize or decay

---

## 6. Phenomenal Information Layer (PIL) Implementation

### 6.1 PIL as a Mode of Operation

PIL is not a location or module. It is a **system-wide operational regime** characterized by:

* Integrated standing-wave dynamics
* Recursive access to internal models
* Temporal persistence
* Global availability

A system can enter or exit PIL-supporting regimes without structural change.

---

### 6.2 Partial and Fragmented PILs

IER allows for:

* Reduced consciousness
* Fragmented experience
* Dissociation
* Pathological states

These correspond to:

* Breakdown of integration
* Loss of coherence
* Disrupted self-model access

---

## 7. Artificial Implementations

### 7.1 Substrate-Agnostic Requirements

Artificial systems could instantiate IER if they support:

* Persistent internal modeling
* Recursive self-representation
* Global information integration
* Temporally continuous dynamics
* Regulation using internal models

Symbolic processing alone is insufficient.

---

### 7.2 Candidate Architectures

Possible AI-relevant mechanisms include:

* Recurrent dynamical systems
* Reservoir computing
* Neuromorphic hardware
* Oscillatory and phase-based computation
* Field-like or wave-based substrates

Whether such systems would generate experience remains an **empirical and ethical question**, not a definitional one.

---

## 8. Why No Single Mechanism Is Privileged

IER does not claim:

* Consciousness is electromagnetic fields
* Consciousness is oscillations
* Consciousness is standing waves

IER claims:

> Consciousness is a **real emergent phenomenon** that occurs when physical systems organize information in specific integrated, temporally extended, self-referential ways.

Standing waves, oscillations, and fields are **plausible mechanisms**, not metaphysical commitments.

---

## Conclusion

This document outlines how the organizational commitments of Informational Experiential Realism could be instantiated in real physical systems. Wave dynamics, resonant modes, distributed basis structures, and affective modulation provide plausible mechanisms for implementing integrated experience without invoking non-physical entities.

IER remains a theory about **what consciousness is**, not **what it must be made of**.

The implementation space is open.
The organizational constraints are not.

# **Appendix B**

## **IER Walkthrough: Experiencing a Green Apple**

*A Didactic Example of Informational Dynamics Becoming Experience*

This appendix provides a step-by-step walkthrough illustrating how ordinary perception becomes conscious experience under IER, mapping physical processes to experiential structure using **nouns, verbs, and grammar**.

---

## 0. Initial Conditions (Before the Apple)

Your system already has:

* An active **Phenomenal Information Layer (PIL)**
* A standing-wave configuration corresponding to:

  * “I am here”
  * A stable body model
  * Ongoing affective tone
  * Environmental context

These are **existing nouns**:

* *self*
* *space*
* *now*

They form the background sentence.

---

## 1. Sensory Contact (Pre-Experiential Input)

### Physical Events

* Photons reflect off a green apple
* Retinal photoreceptors respond to specific wavelengths
* Local transduction waves occur

### IER Status

❌ Not experience yet

Why:

* Information is local
* No global integration
* No self-access

These are **letters**, not words.

---

## 2. Early Visual Processing (Feature Extraction)

### Neural Dynamics

* Edge detection
* Color opponency (green vs red)
* Orientation selectivity
* Motion stability

These involve:

* Local oscillatory activity
* Column-level processing
* Short-lived patterns

### IER Status

⚠️ Still pre-experiential

This is assembling **phonemes**, not nouns.

---

## 3. Global Integration Begins (Entry into PIL)

### Transition Event (Verb)

A **traveling wave / attentional gating event** recruits visual information into global availability.

This is a **verb**:

> *attend-to*

### Physical Implementation

* Thalamocortical synchronization
* Phase alignment across visual areas
* Gamma activity nested in slower rhythms

---

## 4. Formation of the Experiential “Noun”

### Standing-Wave Stabilization

A stable, resonant pattern emerges across distributed areas representing:

* Color: green
* Shape: round-ish
* Size: apple-scale
* Location: “over there”
* Objecthood: unified thing

This pattern:

* Persists over hundreds of milliseconds
* Is globally accessible
* Is recursively accessible

### This Is the Noun:

> **“green apple”**

Not stored anywhere.
Not localized.
Not symbolic.

It is a **stable informational configuration**.

---

## 5. Grammar: Structuring the Experience

The apple is not experienced alone.

Grammar binds it into a structured scene:

* Apple **is in front of me**
* Apple **is separate from me**
* Apple **exists in space**
* Apple **exists now**

This is enforced by:

* Phase relationships
* Cross-frequency nesting
* Coordination with body and spatial models

Grammar determines:

* Order
* Co-existence
* Perspective

This is why you don’t experience:

> “green apple me space color now noise”

You experience a coherent scene.

---

## 6. Affective Coloring (Optional but Common)

Suppose:

* You are hungry
* Or you like apples

An affective wave occurs:

* Dopaminergic modulation
* Autonomic–cortical coupling

This is a **verb with reach**:

> *value-as-good*

It does not add content.
It weights the noun.

Now the apple feels:

* Appealing
* Salient
* Relevant

---

## 7. Action Possibility (Affordance)

Another noun appears:

> *graspable*

This is not motor output yet.
It’s a **mode of availability**.

The apple is experienced as:

* Something you *could* pick up

This emerges from:

* Sensorimotor integration
* Predictive modeling

---

## 8. Temporal Continuity

As you keep looking:

* Micro-verbs update lighting, angle, detail
* The noun remains stable
* Grammar enforces persistence

This is why the apple feels:

> “The same apple over time”

Even though the underlying activity constantly changes.

---

## 9. What Happens If Attention Shifts?

You look away.

A verb acts:

> *withdraw-attention*

The standing-wave noun destabilizes.

The apple:

* Leaves experience
* But may persist in memory
* Or as expectation

Experience updates, not reality.

---

## 10. Why This Feels Like Something

Under IER:

* The “feeling” is not extra
* It is what it is like **to be** a system in that standing-wave configuration with self-access

There is no further ingredient.

---

## One-Sentence Summary

> Experiencing a green apple consists of a stable, globally integrated informational pattern (“noun”) representing the apple, recruited and modified by transient control processes (“verbs”), all structured by dynamical constraints (“grammar”) that enforce unity, perspective, and temporal flow.

# **Appendix C**

## **Comparison to Major Theories of Consciousness**

### *Integrated Information Theory, Global Workspace Theory, and Predictive Processing*

### **Purpose of This Appendix**

This appendix situates Informational Experiential Realism relative to three influential frameworks. The goal is clarification, not adjudication—identifying shared insights, divergent commitments, and how IER reframes familiar ideas within a unified organizational framework.

---

### **C.1 Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**

**Convergence:**
Integration matters. Fragmentation undermines unity.

**Divergence:**
IIT treats consciousness as **fundamental** and ubiquitous; IER treats it as **emergent and rare**. Integration is necessary but not sufficient. IER rejects panpsychism and scalar identity claims (Φ = experience).

---

### **C.2 Global Workspace Theory (GWT)**

**Convergence:**
Global availability and attention are central.

**Divergence:**
IER replaces broadcast metaphors with **dynamical regimes** and explicitly addresses phenomenology rather than access alone. PIL is not a workspace—it is a mode of operation.

---

### **C.3 Predictive Processing (PP)**

**Convergence:**
Internal modeling, inference, and action-perception loops are foundational.

**Divergence:**
Prediction can occur without experience. IER supplies explicit **criteria for phenomenality**, including affect and self-access, which PP leaves underspecified.

---

### **Comparative Summary**

| Dimension     | IIT            | GWT               | PP           | IER                       |
| ------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ------------------------- |
| Consciousness | Fundamental    | Functional access | Not central  | Emergent                  |
| Integration   | Identity       | Functional        | Implicit     | Necessary, not sufficient |
| Self-modeling | Optional       | Optional          | Central      | Required                  |
| Affect        | Underspecified | Secondary         | Instrumental | Core                      |
| Panpsychism   | Implied        | No                | No           | No                        |

---

### **Positioning Statement**

IER incorporates insights from IIT, GWT, and PP while rejecting their ontological excesses and explanatory gaps. It offers a **realist, non-panpsychist, emergent account of consciousness grounded in informational organization and physical dynamics**.
