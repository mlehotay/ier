## 0. Status and scope

This article explains **looping** under Informational Experiential Realism (IER).

Its purpose is to clarify how a system can appear to “repeat itself” over time **without replay, memory, representation, or return to the past**.

This article:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics**
* does **not** classify loops as healthy or pathological
* does **not** appeal to deliberation, narrative, or introspection

It performs **structural clarification only**, naming a dynamic pattern already presupposed across discussions of traversal, sedimentation, admissible futures, and resolution.

## 1. The problem looping creates

Many systems appear to “do the same thing again”:

* habits recur
* compulsions reassert
* patterns repeat across time
* outcomes feel inevitable despite awareness

Naively, this suggests:

* replay of stored content,
* return to prior states,
* or failure to “learn from the past.”

Under IER, none of these explanations are admissible.

Nothing is replayed.
Nothing is retrieved.
Nothing returns.

Looping must therefore be explained **without backward reference**.

---

## 2. What looping is not

Looping is **not**:

* repetition of an experience
* recurrence of an event
* traversal of the same historical path
* cycling back to a previous state
* reactivation of stored content

A system under IER **never re-enters its past**.
All motion is forward.
All deformation is irreversible.

Any account of looping that requires “going back” is structurally invalid.

---

## 3. The core definition

Under IER:

> **A loop is a forward-only attractor in admissible-future topology that repeatedly regenerates the same collapse direction under traversal.**

This definition contains no temporal circularity.

A loop is not a circle in time.
It is a **self-reproducing constraint geometry**.

---

## 4. How looping arises from sedimentation

Sedimentation deforms admissible-future topology irreversibly.

When that deformation has a particular shape, it can produce looping.

Specifically, looping arises when sedimentation produces:

* a **narrow basin of attraction**
* whose local cost gradients strongly favor one continuation
* and whose traversal further steepens those same gradients

Each traversal:

* closes alternatives early,
* stabilizes a single direction of motion,
* and deposits additional sediment in the same configuration.

The result is **progressive canalization**.

Nothing repeats.
The deformation deepens.

---

## 5. Looping and choice space

Loops are often misdescribed as “taking the same path through choice space again.”

This is incorrect.

The system does not traverse the *same* choice space.
Choice space is regenerated at each moment from:

* current intrinsic constraint
* accumulated sedimented deformation

A loop exists when that regeneration repeatedly yields:

* the same narrow bottleneck,
* the same early collapse of alternatives,
* the same direction of foreclosure.

What recurs is not a path, but a **structural affordance**.

---

## 6. The pipeline view of looping

From the resolution pipeline perspective, looping has a characteristic profile:

1. **Bias formation**
   Bias gradients are steep and asymmetric, strongly pricing one continuation.

2. **Early collapse**
   Alternatives collapse quickly, before traversal can redistribute cost.

3. **Inertia dominance**
   Once inside the basin, inertia carries traversal forward cheaply.

4. **Settlement**
   Settlement locks in deformation that further steepens the same bias gradients.

This sequence repeats — not in time, but in **structure**.

Each cycle produces a *new* settlement that makes the next cycle harder to interrupt.

---

## 7. Why looping feels repetitive

Looping feels repetitive because:

* the same futures keep disappearing first,
* the same costs are borne in the same order,
* the same narrative shadows are cast by settlement.

But structurally:

* the system is older,
* the topology is narrower,
* the basin is deeper,
* the loop is more entrenched.

The feeling of “again” is produced by **structural similarity of foreclosure**, not by replay of content.

---

## 8. Owned and unowned looping

Looping does not determine ownership.

Both owned and unowned traversal can loop.

### Owned looping

Examples include:

* skill
* practice
* fluency
* well-calibrated habit

Here, looping reflects **stable, cheap traversal** through a deliberately cultivated basin.

### Unowned looping

Examples include:

* compulsion
* addiction
* trauma-driven patterns
* disorganized repetition

Here, traversal repeatedly collapses before ownership can reattach.

The structure is the same.
Ownership differs.
Phenomenology diverges.

---

## 9. Why loops are hard to exit

Loops are not exited by “choosing differently,” because the loop **precedes selection**.

To exit a loop requires:

> **introducing sufficient intrinsic constraint early enough to deform the topology before collapse occurs.**

This is expensive because it requires:

* early intervention in bias formation,
* re-coordination of constraint,
* tolerance of temporary instability,
* ownership of increased traversal cost.

Insight, memory, or narrative reinterpretation alone cannot do this, because they do not alter constraint geometry.

---

## 10. Looping and identity

Looping does not threaten identity.

The same system continues to own (or fail to own) traversal across a deformed topology.

Identity persists because:

* the system continues to bear intrinsic constraint,
* the history–future boundary remains operated,
* admissible futures remain non-empty.

A loop narrows identity’s future.
It does not multiply subjects or fracture continuity by itself.

---

## 11. Temporal asymmetry reaffirmed

Looping does not introduce temporal circularity.

* no past state is revisited
* no prior event recurs
* no experience is replayed

All motion is forward.
All deformation accumulates.

The apparent cycle is generated by **a stable forward attractor**, not by reversal of time.

---

## 12. What this article does not claim

This article does **not** claim:

* that loops are pathological
* that loops must be broken
* that looping is maladaptive
* that looping implies lack of agency
* that loops can be diagnosed or measured

It names a structural phenomenon, not a prescription.

---

## Intermission

**Structural fact:**
*A loop is not repetition of the past; it is the future being narrowed in the same way again.*
