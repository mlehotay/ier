## **The Constraint Hexad: Six Projections of Experiential Constraint**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**
*Orientation Article — Non-Normative, Non-Foundational*

---

## **0. Status, Scope, and Containment**

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no ontological primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, diagnostics, or mechanisms**
* introduces **no new structure**
* revises **no existing definitions or claims**
* does **not** compete with or restate `IER-topology.md`

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md
IER-theory.md
IER-dynamics.md
IER-topology.md
```

If any statement in this document conflicts with those texts, the conflict is resolved in their favor and the conflicting statement here is void.

### Containment Rule (Binding for This Document)

> The term **Constraint Hexad** is a **local organizational label** used **only** in `IER-hexad.md`.

It carries:

* **no independent explanatory force**
* **no canonical authority**
* **no use outside this document**

Nothing elsewhere in the IER corpus relies on, presupposes, or requires this framing.

---

## **1. Purpose: Why This Document Exists**

Across the IER corpus, several explanatory domains recur as **central but distinct orientations** toward experiential constraint:

* time
* memory
* identity
* agency
* history
* possibility

Each domain is treated rigorously and independently, without relying on the others for definitional support.

Readers nevertheless notice a stable pattern:

> these topics recur,
> they are structurally linked,
> yet they are distributed across many documents
> without a single navigational handle

This document exists **only** to:

* name that six-fold pattern,
* explain **why it stabilizes at six**, and
* identify the **specific corpus articles** that serve as the projection anchors.

This document does **not** perform theoretical synthesis.
That work is done elsewhere.

---

## **2. The Constraint Hexad (Naming Only)**

The **Constraint Hexad** refers to six **projection domains**, each corresponding to a distinct explanatory question that arises *once* the IER identity claim is in place:

1. **Time**
2. **Memory**
3. **Identity**
4. **Agency**
5. **History**
6. **Possibility**

Each projection:

* is **explanatory**, not ontological
* answers a **distinct question**
* is **not reducible** to any other
* introduces **no new foundations**

The hexad is **descriptive, not generative**.

---

## **3. Why Exactly Six (And Not More)**

The hexad stabilizes at six because each element answers a **non-redundant explanatory question** that cannot be eliminated or merged without loss.

| Question Addressed                 | Projection  |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------- |
| What is happening now?             | Time        |
| What remains reachable?            | Memory      |
| Who is bearing this?               | Identity    |
| Is this resolution owned?          | Agency      |
| Why is the system shaped this way? | History     |
| What could still occur?            | Possibility |

This is a **coverage result**, not a metaphysical claim.

* No two projections answer the same question.
* No projection can be removed without leaving a gap.
* No additional projection can be added without redundancy.

The hexad does **not** assert that reality has six parts.
It asserts only that **IER forces these six explanatory questions once experience exists**.

---

## **4. Relation to `IER-topology.md` (Strict Non-Duplication)**

`IER-topology.md` establishes that:

* there is **one underlying constraint geometry**, and
* time, memory, identity, agency, history, and possibility are **projections** of it.

This document does **not**:

* restate that argument,
* summarize its content, or
* provide an alternative synthesis.

Instead:

> **`IER-topology.md` explains *why* these projections exist.
> `IER-hexad.md` explains *where they live in the corpus*.**

Topology is structural.
Hexad is navigational.

---

## **5. The Six Projection Articles (Canonical Index)**

Each projection domain corresponds to **one—and only one—primary article** in the IER corpus.

These articles are the **projection anchors**.

---

### **5.1 Time**

**`IER-continuity.md`**
*Experiential gaps without subject replacement*

This article anchors the **time projection**, explaining temporal passage and continuity as consequences of irreversible constraint resolution, without invoking a privileged present, stored sequences, or temporal containers.

---

### **5.2 Memory**

**`IER-memory.md`**
*Memory as constraint-structured re-entry*

This article anchors the **memory projection**, explaining remembering and forgetting as features of future accessibility under current constraint, without storage, traces, or retrieval.

---

### **5.3 Identity**

**`IER-identity.md`**
*Personal identity as persistence of intrinsic constraint ownership*

This article anchors the **identity projection**, explaining persistence across change and gaps without appeal to memory, narrative, or psychological similarity.

---

### **5.4 Agency**

**`IER-agency.md`**
*Agency as owned resolution of intrinsic constraint*

This article anchors the **agency projection**, explaining choice and action as owned collapse of admissible futures, without indeterminism or executive control.

---

### **5.5 History**

**`IER-sedimentation.md`**
*Structural history without storage*

This article anchors the **history projection**, explaining how past events shape future behavior through sedimentation and hysteresis, without retained records or replay.

---

### **5.6 Possibility**

**`IER-futures.md`**
*Admissible futures viewed from structural and experiential perspectives*

This article anchors the **possibility projection**, explaining what can still occur as a function of admissible continuations under current constraint, without probability, imagination, or modal metaphysics.

---

Each projection article:

* presupposes the IER identity claim,
* introduces **no new foundations**,
* treats its projection **in isolation**, and
* defers all unification to `IER-topology.md`.

---

## **6. What the Hexad Is *Not***

The Constraint Hexad is **not**:

* a faculty model
* a component breakdown
* a list of mental powers
* a metaphysical taxonomy
* a claim about human universals
* a replacement for psychological categories

It does **not** imply that experience consists of six parts, layers, or modules.

It is a **reader-facing organizing lens**, nothing more.

---

## **7. How to Use (or Ignore) This Framing**

Readers may:

* read any projection article independently,
* read them in any order,
* consult this document only as an index, or
* ignore the hexad entirely.

Nothing in IER requires awareness of this framing.

The hexad exists solely to **reduce orientation cost**, not to impose structure.

---

## **Intermission — Structural Fact**

> **The hexad names a pattern the theory already forces.
> It adds nothing to it.**
