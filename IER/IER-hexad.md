## **The Constraint Hexad: Six Projections of Experiential Constraint**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**
*Orientation Article — Non-Normative, Non-Foundational*

---

## 0. Status, Scope, and Containment

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no ontological primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, diagnostics, or mechanisms**
* introduces **no new structure**
* revises **no existing definitions or claims**
* does **not** compete with or restate `IER-topology.md`

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md
IER-theory.md
IER-dynamics.md
IER-topology.md
```

If any statement in this document conflicts with those texts, the conflict is resolved in their favor and the conflicting statement here is void.

### Containment rule (binding for this document)

> The term **Constraint Hexad** is a **local organizational metaphor** used **only** in `IER-hexad.md`.

It carries:

* **no independent explanatory force**
* **no canonical authority**
* **no use outside this document**

Nothing elsewhere in the IER corpus relies on, presupposes, or requires this framing.

---

## 1. Purpose: Why This Document Exists

Across the IER corpus, several topics recur as **central but distinct explanatory domains**:

* time
* memory
* identity
* agency
* history
* possibility

Each is developed independently, in depth, and without reliance on the others for definitional support.

Readers nevertheless notice a pattern:

> these topics feel tightly coupled
> yet they are distributed across many documents
> without a single navigational handle

This document exists **only** to:

* name that recurring six-fold pattern,
* explain **why it stabilizes at six** rather than expanding indefinitely, and
* provide a **clean index** to the corresponding top-level articles.

This document does **not** perform theoretical synthesis.
That work is done elsewhere.

## 2. The Constraint Hexad (Naming Only)

The **Constraint Hexad** refers to the following six **projection domains**, each treated exhaustively in its own top-level article:

1. **Time**
2. **Memory**
3. **Identity**
4. **Agency**
5. **History**
6. **Possibility**

Each domain corresponds to a **distinct explanatory orientation** toward experiential constraint once experience already exists under IER.

No member of the hexad is:

* more fundamental
* more real
* causally prior
* explanatorily complete on its own

The hexad is **descriptive, not generative**.

---

## 3. Why Exactly Six (And Not More)

The hexad stabilizes at six because each element answers a **non-reducible question** that necessarily arises *once* the IER identity claim is in place.

| Question addressed                 | Projection  |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------- |
| What is happening now?             | Time        |
| What remains reachable?            | Memory      |
| Who is bearing this?               | Identity    |
| Is this resolution owned?          | Agency      |
| Why is the system shaped this way? | History     |
| What could still occur?            | Possibility |

Each question is structurally distinct.

* No two projections answer the same question.
* No projection can be eliminated without leaving a gap.
* No additional projection can be added without redundancy.

This is a **coverage result**, not a metaphysical claim.

The hexad does not assert that reality comes in six parts.
It asserts only that **these six explanatory questions cannot be collapsed further** under IER without distortion.

## 4. Relation to `IER-topology.md` (Strict Non-Duplication)

`IER-topology.md` establishes that:

* there is **one underlying constraint geometry**, and
* time, memory, identity, agency, history, and possibility are **projections** of it.

This document does **not**:

* restate that argument,
* summarize its content, or
* provide an alternate synthesis.

Instead:

> **`IER-topology.md` explains *why* these projections exist.
> `IER-hexad.md` explains *how they are organized in the corpus*.**

Topology is structural.
Hexad is navigational.

## 5. The Six Top-Level Articles (Index)

Each member of the Constraint Hexad has **one—and only one—top-level article** in the IER corpus.

### 5.1 Time

**`IER-time.md`**
*Time as Asymmetric Constraint Traversal*

Explains why temporal passage arises from irreversible constraint resolution, without treating time as a container, parameter, or stored sequence.

---

### 5.2 Memory

**`IER-memory.md`**
*Memory as Constraint-Structured Re-Entry*

Explains memory without storage, retrieval, or retained contents, as a feature of future accessibility under current constraint.

---

### 5.3 Identity

**`IER-identity.md`**
*Identity as Persistence of Constraint Ownership*

Explains identity as system-level persistence under intrinsic constraint, independent of recall, narrative continuity, or psychological similarity.

---

### 5.4 Agency

**`IER-agency.md`**
*Agency as Owned Resolution of Constraint*

Explains agency as the owned collapse of admissible futures, without indeterminism, executive control, or representational choice.

---

### 5.5 History

**`IER-history.md`**
*History as Sedimented Constraint*

Explains how past events shape future behavior without stored records, traces, or retained experiential content.

---

### 5.6 Possibility

**`IER-possibility.md`**
*Possibility as Open Constraint Topology*

Explains possibility as the structure of physically admissible continuations under current constraint, not as imagination, probability, or expectation.

---

Each article:

* presupposes the IER identity claim,
* introduces **no new foundations**,
* treats its projection **in isolation**, and
* defers all unification to `IER-topology.md`.

---

## 6. What the Hexad Is *Not*

The Constraint Hexad is **not**:

* a faculty model
* a component breakdown
* a list of mental powers
* a metaphysical taxonomy
* a claim about human universals
* a replacement for psychological categories

It does **not** imply that experience consists of six parts, layers, or modules.

It is a **reader-facing organizing lens**, nothing more.

---

## 7. How to Use (or Ignore) This Framing

Readers may:

* read any hexad article independently,
* read them in any order,
* consult this document only as an index, or
* ignore the hexad entirely.

Nothing in IER requires awareness of this framing.

The hexad exists solely to **reduce orientation cost**, not to impose structure.

---

## Intermission — Structural Fact

> **The hexad names a pattern the theory already forces.
> It adds nothing to it.**
