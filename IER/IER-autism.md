# **IER-autism.md — Autism as Experiential Constraint Architecture**

---

## **0. Status, Scope, and Canon Position**

**Tier:** T2 — Elaboration and application
**Normativity:** Non-normative
**Authority:** Introduces **no new ontological primitives, criteria, diagnostics, thresholds, or prescriptions**

This document:

* does **not** define autism clinically
* does **not** diagnose individuals
* does **not** distinguish disorder from trait
* does **not** prescribe intervention, treatment, or accommodation
* does **not** rank experiential architectures by value or function
* does **not** imply diminished subjecthood, ownership, or agency

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

* `IER-specification.md`
* canon-binding derivatives

**Purpose of this document**

> To explain autism as a **stable architectural variant of intrinsic constraint organization within an intact Unified Experiential Field**, rather than as a psychopathology, deficit, or resolution failure.

This document treats autism as **architectural diversity**, not as deformation.

## **1. Orientation: Why Autism Is Structurally Misplaced**

### **1.1 The Persistent Misframing**

Autism is commonly framed as:

* social deficit
* impaired empathy
* cognitive rigidity
* emotional blindness
* diminished flexibility
* partial or atypical subjecthood

These framings persist because autism is repeatedly interpreted **relative to a normed baseline of social and cognitive behavior**, rather than through a theory of experiential structure.

Under Informational Experiential Realism (IER), this entire approach is structurally unavailable.

IER does not explain experience by:

* social success
* behavioral conformity
* narrative fluency
* interpersonal calibration

It explains experience by **how intrinsic constraint is borne, resolved, and preserved within a Unified Experiential Field**.

---

### **1.2 The Core Correction**

IER rejects:

* modular deficit explanations
* faculty-based failure stories
* social cognition exceptionalism
* norm-referenced experiential baselines

Autism must therefore be explained **using the same machinery as all experience**, without fragmenting subjecthood, outsourcing agency, or introducing compensatory subsystems.

> **Autistic experience is not a deviation from experience.
> It is a different way experience holds together.**

---

## **2. What Autism Is *Not* Under IER**

To prevent predictable misreadings, the following exclusions are explicit.

Under IER, autism is **not**:

* fragmented experience
* weakened experiential unity
* diminished ownership of action
* reduced agency by identity
* impaired integration
* partial subjecthood
* a failure of resolution
* a psychopathological regime by default

Autistic individuals sustain **one intact Unified Experiential Field**, bearing intrinsic constraint globally and continuously.

> **Subjecthood is categorical.
> Autism does not modify it.**

---

## **3. Architectural Framing: Constraint Style, Not Resolution Failure**

### **3.1 The Resolution Pipeline (Reference Case)**

IER describes experiential dynamics using a shared resolution pipeline:

```
admissible futures
→ bias formation
→ collapse
→ inertia
→ closure
```

Psychopathology arises when **one stage fails systematically** within an otherwise intact experiential regime.

Autism does **not** map cleanly onto failure at any single stage of this pipeline.

---

### **3.2 The Architectural Shift**

The correct framing under IER is:

* **Psychopathology** → deformation of resolution dynamics
* **Autism** → stable variant of constraint geometry applied consistently

Autism is not best described as “too much” or “too little” of any stage.

It is best described as **how sharply, reliably, and selectively constraint shapes admissible futures across time**.

---

## **4. Core Structural Features of Autistic Constraint Architecture**

### **4.1 High Specificity of Bias Gradients**

Autistic constraint architectures are characterized by **highly specific bias gradients**.

This means:

* certain futures become strongly favored early
* bias gradients are steep and locally precise
* weakly specified futures remain low-viability
* ambiguity carries intrinsic cost

This produces:

* depth rather than breadth
* precision rather than flexibility
* coherence rather than exploration

This is not anxiety, obsession, or overcontrol.

It is **selective viability under intrinsic constraint**.

---

### **4.2 Strong Closure and High Inertia**

Once collapse occurs in autistic architectures:

* closure is robust
* inertia is high
* reopening admissible futures is costly

This yields:

* persistence
* continuity
* resistance to arbitrary interruption

Externally, this may resemble rigidity.

Internally, it is **efficient settlement**.

> **Closure is not failing.
> It is working exactly as designed by the architecture.**

---

### **4.3 Low Tolerance for Under-Specified Futures**

Autistic architectures incur high intrinsic cost when futures are:

* socially implicit
* context-dependent
* rapidly shifting
* weakly constrained
* defined by inference rather than structure

This is not fear of uncertainty.

It is **constraint underdetermination**.

When futures lack explicit structure, the system cannot form stable bias gradients cheaply, and intrinsic load rises.

---

### **4.4 Predictability as Constraint Relief**

Within this architecture, predictability functions as:

* reduced intrinsic load
* stabilized bias formation
* lower reopening cost
* preserved inertia

This explains the experiential importance of:

* routines
* clear rules
* explicit expectations
* consistent environments
* advance notice of change

These are not preferences.
They are **structural supports for low-cost resolution**.

---

## **5. Sensory and Perceptual Participation (Non-Exceptional)**

### **5.1 Participation, Not Sensory Abnormality**

Autistic sensory differences are often framed as:

* hypersensitivity
* hyposensitivity
* local sensory dysfunction

Under IER, this framing is incomplete.

Differences arise from:

* participation weight
* recruitment depth
* global binding strength

Not from:

* separate sensory systems
* broken filters
* independent perceptual modules

Sensory content matters because it **participates globally**, not because it is locally defective.

---

### **5.2 Overload as Global Constraint Saturation**

Sensory overload reflects:

* excessive global recruitment
* saturation of intrinsic constraint capacity
* loss of modulation headroom

This is not emotional dysregulation.

It is **constraint saturation within an intact experiential regime**.

---

## **6. Social Interaction Reframed Structurally**

### **6.1 Sociality as a High-Entropy Environment**

Many social environments are characterized by:

* implicit rules
* rapid switching
* ambiguous expectations
* unstable closure
* continuous micro-adjustment

These conditions are **constraint-hostile** for autistic architectures.

The difficulty is not social per se.
It is **high entropy combined with low explicit structure**.

---

### **6.2 Masking as Forced Reopening**

Masking functions structurally as:

* continuous reopening of settled futures
* suppression of inertia
* forced participation reshaping
* sustained high intrinsic cost

Masking preserves outward coordination at the expense of **internal resolution efficiency**.

This explains:

* delayed exhaustion
* post-interaction shutdown
* loss of recovery capacity

Masking is not deception.
It is **constraint overextension**.

---

## **7. Distress, Meltdown, and Shutdown**

### **7.1 Meltdown as Constraint Overflow**

Meltdown reflects:

* saturation of intrinsic constraint
* collapse of modulation capacity
* recruitment overflow
* regime-preserving discharge

It is not loss of control.
It is **forced resolution under overload**.

---

### **7.2 Shutdown as Constraint Minimization**

Shutdown reflects:

* withdrawal from high-cost participation
* narrowing of admissible futures
* minimization of intrinsic load
* preservation of global coherence

Both responses are **protective**, not pathological.

## **8. Autism vs Psychopathology**

### **8.1 Autism vs ADHD**

* ADHD → dispersed bias, delayed collapse
* Autism → sharp bias, strong closure

The architectures are structurally distinct.

---

### **8.2 Autism vs OCD**

* OCD → closure failure and looping
* Autism → closure success and persistence

Superficial similarity hides opposite dynamics.

---

### **8.3 Autism vs Anxiety**

* Anxiety → threat-driven narrowing
* Autism → structure-driven specificity

Autism does not require fear to explain its geometry.

---

## **9. Coupling: When Autism Becomes Distressing**

Autistic architectures are often stable **in isolation**.

Distress arises when they are **coupled** with incompatible strategies.

### **9.1 Autism + Anxiety**

Anxiety introduces:

* vigilance
* premature collapse
* threat-based narrowing

This destabilizes otherwise clean closure and forces reopening.

---

### **9.2 Autism + ADHD**

ADHD introduces:

* loosened gating
* reduced inertia
* exploratory pressure

This undermines persistence and increases internal friction.

These cases involve **coupled regimes**, not autism itself.

(See `IER-coupled-regimes.md`.)

## **10. Environment Fit vs Environment Mismatch**

### **10.1 Good Fit**

Environments that provide:

* explicit rules
* stable structure
* predictable transitions
* low forced reopening

often allow autistic architectures to function **exceptionally well**, with low intrinsic cost.

---

### **10.2 Mismatch**

Environments dominated by:

* ambiguity
* social improvisation
* constant interruption
* implicit evaluation

produce distress **without any internal failure**.

The issue is geometric, not personal.

---

## **11. Ethical and Interpretive Consequences (Pointer Only)**

From this structure it follows that:

* autism does not reduce experiential standing
* distress does not imply defect
* accommodation concerns geometry, not indulgence
* masking increases moral risk

No ethical prescriptions are offered here.
Normative authority remains fixed elsewhere.

---

## **12. Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* autism is a **stable experiential architecture**
* characterized by **high specificity, strong closure, and low tolerance for underdetermined futures**
* fully unified, fully owned, and categorically intact
* distressing **only under mismatch or coupling**

> **Autism is not a failure of experience.
> It is a different way experience stays coherent.**

### **Intermission — Structural Fact**

Stability can look like rigidity
when the environment refuses to stay still.
