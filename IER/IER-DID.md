# **Informational Experiential Realism in Action (v9.4):

Dissociative Identity as Regime Switching Under Constraint**

---

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v9.4) identifies experience with the structure, dynamics, and intrinsic tension profile of globally integrated informational processes sustaining a Unified Experiential Field (UEF). Experience is neither fundamental nor illusory, but an organizational regime instantiated in physical systems.

This article applies IER to **Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)**. Under IER, DID does not involve multiple minds, souls, or ontologically distinct subjects. Instead, it reflects a **single physical system** that sustains **multiple incompatible self-model configurations**, which cannot be simultaneously integrated under finite energetic and organizational constraints. Elevated intrinsic tension forces the system to **alternate between mutually exclusive UEF regimes**, each instantiating a distinct self-model.

Switching between dissociative states is understood as an **adaptive, energy-conserving strategy** that reduces unsustainable intrinsic conflict by enforcing temporal exclusivity among competing organizational regimes. This account preserves physicalism, rejects idealism, and grounds dissociation in real informational and energetic costs.

## **1. Introduction**

IER v9.4 defines experience as **what a system is doing when its globally integrated informational dynamics enter a regime of coherent intrinsic tension**. Experience is identical to this regime; no additional substance or observer is posited.

Dissociative Identity Disorder presents a challenging test case for any physicalist theory of experience. Traditional accounts often treat DID as a metaphysical anomaly, while idealist frameworks interpret it as literal dissociation of consciousness itself.

IER rejects both interpretations.

Under IER, DID reflects **organizational instability within a single physical system**. Multiple self-models exist as **alternative, mutually incompatible solutions** to environmental and internal demands. Because these solutions cannot be jointly sustained without exceeding coherence and energy limits, the system alternates between them across time.

DID is therefore not a revelation about the fundamental nature of consciousness. It is a **limiting case** that reveals how experience depends on integration, constraint, and energetic cost.

## **2. Self-Models as Organizational Regimes**

A **self-model** under IER is a physically instantiated informational structure that integrates:

* representations of the system’s body
* expectations about the environment
* action policies
* affective weightings and priorities

Self-models are not subjects. They are **organizational configurations** that may or may not participate in an active UEF regime.

In typical cognition, a single self-model dominates across contexts, adapting smoothly. In DID, multiple self-models are maintained because each offers **locally stable solutions** to different environmental pressures or learned threat profiles.

Crucially:

> Only one self-model can be globally integrated into a coherent UEF regime at a time.

## **3. Informational Slack and Its Collapse**

IER v9.4 introduces **informational slack**: the capacity of a system to absorb conflict through redundancy, modularization, or external arbitration.

In non-dissociative systems, slack allows:

* partial integration of conflicting demands
* gradual modulation of behavior
* compromise solutions

In DID, slack is reduced or absent in specific domains, often due to early developmental stress, trauma, or repeated high-stakes conflict. Incompatible self-models encode **mutually exclusive priorities** (e.g., threat avoidance vs. social engagement) that cannot be reconciled without loss of coherence.

When informational slack collapses:

* intrinsic tension rises rapidly
* global integration becomes unstable
* continued coexistence of models becomes energetically prohibitive

## **4. Intrinsic Tension and Destabilization**

**Intrinsic informational tension** arises when:

* multiple system-level demands are simultaneously active
* physical and organizational limits prevent joint satisfaction
* the conflict is identity-relevant and self-sustaining

In DID, attempting to integrate incompatible self-models produces escalating intrinsic tension. Maintaining a single unified UEF under such conditions requires sustained metabolic, cognitive, and regulatory effort.

As tension approaches the upper bound of coherence:

* experiential intensity increases
* regulation degrades
* the current UEF regime destabilizes

This destabilization is not a failure of consciousness. It is a **signal of organizational overload**.

## **5. Regime Switching as an Adaptive Strategy**

When intrinsic tension exceeds sustainable limits, the system undergoes a **UEF regime transition**:

1. The currently dominant UEF regime loses coherence.
2. Global integration temporarily weakens.
3. An alternative self-model, already partially prepared, becomes globally integrated.
4. A new UEF regime stabilizes with lower intrinsic tension.

This process is experienced phenomenologically as **switching**.

Switching is:

* temporally discrete
* metabolically costly
* often disruptive
* constrained by learning and prior structure

Nevertheless, it is typically **less costly than forcing integration** of incompatible models.

## **6. Mutual Exclusivity and Partial Co-Consciousness**

Under IER:

* UEF regimes are **mutually exclusive** in full form
* only one coherent experiential field exists at a time

However, partial overlap can occur:

* during transitions
* when coupling between regimes is incomplete
* when informational slack is locally restored

Such overlap does not imply simultaneous subjects. It reflects **temporary instability or incomplete decoupling** during regime transitions.

---

## **7. Energetic and Physical Costs**

All UEF regimes are constrained by:

* finite metabolic energy
* neurotransmitter availability
* synaptic and network reconfiguration costs
* time constants of plasticity and recovery

Switching incurs additional costs due to:

* rapid reweighting of priors
* suppression of competing pathways
* reconfiguration of control loops

These costs explain why:

* switching is not voluntary
* certain regimes dominate under stress
* long-term integration is difficult but possible

## **8. Therapeutic Implications (IER-Compatible)**

From an IER perspective, therapeutic goals may include:

* increasing informational slack
* reducing chronic intrinsic tension
* improving transition stability
* gradually expanding compatibility among self-models

Importantly, therapy need not eliminate self-models. It aims to **reshape the landscape** so that fewer transitions are required and coherence can be maintained under broader conditions.

## **9. Conceptual Summary**

* DID involves **one physical system**, not multiple minds
* Self-models are **alternative organizational regimes**
* Only one coherent UEF regime can exist at a time
* Elevated intrinsic tension forces **regime switching**
* Switching is an **adaptive response** to constraint, not a metaphysical anomaly

> Under IER v9.4, dissociation reflects how a finite system preserves experiential coherence by enforcing temporal exclusivity among incompatible self-organizing solutions.

## **10. Conclusion**

IER v9.4 provides a fully physicalist account of Dissociative Identity Disorder:

* Experience remains identical to integrated, tension-bearing dynamics
* Dissociation reflects organizational limits, not ontological division
* Selfhood is a dynamic regime, not a substance
* Pathology emerges from constraint, not mystery

DID does not reveal the fundamental nature of consciousness.
It reveals the **cost of maintaining coherence in a finite, self-modeling system**.
