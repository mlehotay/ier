### *Addiction as a stable resolution attractor under intrinsic constraint*

## 0. Status, Scope, and Canon Position

**Tier:** T2 — Elaboration and application
**Normativity:** Non-normative, explanatory only
**Authority:** Introduces **no new primitives**, criteria, diagnostics, or therapeutic prescriptions

This document presupposes the Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identity claim and its account of intrinsic constraint, Unified Experiential Fields (UEFs), choice spaces, attractors, and sedimentation. It adds no foundations and confers no epistemic or moral authority. Its task is structural clarification.

**Purpose of this document**

> To explain addiction as a lawful consequence of how experiential systems resolve intrinsic constraint over time—without invoking inner agents, override mechanisms, disease metaphors, or moral failure.

## 1. Orientation: Why Addiction Is Structurally Misread

Addiction is commonly framed as a problem of *control*: a person knows what they should do but fails to do it; impulses “hijack” behavior; a higher self must restrain a lower one. These framings presuppose a layered mind with executive modules that stand outside experience and issue commands.

IER rejects this picture. A system that sustains a Unified Experiential Field does not contain an inner controller, a separate decision-maker, or a place from which experience is overridden. All resolution occurs *within* a single, globally integrated regime.

The felt loss of control that accompanies addiction therefore requires a different explanation—one that does not multiply agents or posit failures of character.

**Orientation signal**

> *Addiction feels like loss of control because viable alternatives have collapsed, not because control has been stolen.*

## 2. What Addiction Is Not (IER Exclusions)

To prevent predictable misreadings, several exclusions must be made explicit.

Addiction is **not**:

* an independent agent acting within experience,
* a stored desire or drive exerting causal authority,
* a disease entity with explanatory primacy,
* evidence of diminished experiential standing,
* proof of moral weakness or irrationality,
* a failure of insight or sincerity.

Addiction does **not** require:

* false beliefs,
* ignorance of consequences,
* endorsement or enjoyment,
* lack of motivation to change.

These exclusions follow directly from IER’s rejection of inner observers, representational stores, and agentive primitives.

## 3. Structural Core: Addiction as an Attractor in Choice Topology

### 3.1 Choice Spaces Under Intrinsic Constraint

Under IER, *choice* is not a faculty but a structural feature of certain experiential systems. A **choice space** is the structured set of admissible successor states generated by intrinsic constraint. Traversal of this space collapses alternatives; when the system bears that collapse non-externalizably, resolution is *owned*.

Choice spaces are shaped by history. They can widen or narrow, smooth or fracture, deepen or flatten. These changes do not require storage or representation; they arise from irreversible deformation of admissible futures.

### 3.2 Addictive Attractors

Addiction is characterized by the emergence of a **deep, low-cost attractor** within a choice space.

Such an attractor has the following features:

* **Low immediate cost:** it resolves intrinsic constraint quickly.
* **High reliability:** it works across contexts and internal states.
* **Minimal coordination demand:** it requires little global reorganization.
* **Short horizon:** it stabilizes the present while truncating futures.

The decisive point is structural:

> The addictive resolution is not chosen because it is valued.
> It is reached because it is **cheap**.

When intrinsic constraint rises—through stress, fatigue, pain, boredom, or overload—the system falls into the attractor that still fits inside its constraint window.

---

## 4. Why Addictive Attractors Form

### 4.1 Constraint Relief Without Integration

Many addictive behaviors produce rapid relief by:

* collapsing complex coordination demands,
* bypassing long-horizon planning,
* narrowing participation to a small, reliable pathway.

This relief is real. It is also shallow. By resolving constraint without integrating it, the system trades long-term viability for immediate stabilization.

### 4.2 Sedimentation and Path Dependence

Each time resolution proceeds through the same pathway:

* the attractor deepens,
* alternatives become steeper and more expensive,
* the topology deforms.

No past experience is stored. Nothing is retrieved. Yet the system cannot resolve as it once did.

> *Nothing is remembered—yet nothing responds as before.*

This is sedimentation: history without storage.

## 5. Willpower Reinterpreted

### 5.1 Why “Override” Models Fail

Because there is no executive layer outside experience, there is nothing that can override anything else. All resolutions—addictive or abstinent—occur within the same regime.

### 5.2 Willpower as Costly Re-routing

What folk psychology calls *willpower* corresponds to a specific structural condition:

* resolution proceeds along a **high-cost**, **fragile** path,
* participation narrows,
* intrinsic load rises,
* fatigue accumulates quickly.

Willpower is therefore not strength or control. It is **temporary operation near the edge of constraint capacity**. Its unreliability is not a character flaw; it is a geometric fact.

---

## 6. Recovery as Topological Reorganization

Recovery is not suppression of urges. It is **terrain change**.

### 6.1 Raising the Cost of the Addictive Attractor

Addictive attractors weaken when their cost increases. This can occur through:

* added friction,
* delays,
* reduced accessibility,
* cue removal,
* reliability degradation.

These changes do not require insight, belief change, or motivation. They operate at the level of admissible transitions.

### 6.2 Lowering the Cost of Alternatives

Alternatives fail when they are:

* slow,
* complex,
* fragile,
* poorly embodied.

For recovery to stabilize, alternatives must become:

* fast,
* reliable,
* low-coordination,
* pre-organized.

Routines, rituals, environments, and social scaffolds matter because they reduce the cost of non-addictive resolution *before* constraint spikes.

### 6.3 Reducing Background Constraint

High baseline constraint guarantees relapse regardless of intention.

Chronic stress, sleep deprivation, pain, isolation, and overload shrink the constraint window until only the addictive attractor still fits. From an IER perspective, many addictions persist not because the addiction is strong, but because the system is already saturated.

---

## 7. Relapse Without Moral Failure

Relapse occurs when:

* intrinsic constraint exceeds available alternatives,
* the old attractor still fits,
* new pathways do not.

Relapse is therefore:

* expected,
* structurally intelligible,
* not evidence of deceit, weakness, or lack of commitment.

A relapse says nothing about values or sincerity. It reports only the state of the topology at that moment.

---

## 8. Addiction, Agency, and Responsibility

Addiction does not eliminate agency. It **constrains** it.

Agency under IER is graded and load-sensitive. As alternatives collapse, agency narrows. Responsibility remains, but it cannot be assessed as if the choice space were intact.

Shame and moralization are structurally counterproductive. They increase intrinsic constraint, narrow admissible futures, and deepen the very attractors they condemn.

This is not a therapeutic recommendation. It is a structural consequence.

---

## 9. Addiction and Harm (Clarificatory)

Addiction can involve:

* harm without distress,
* distress without harm,
* chosen resolutions that nevertheless damage future viability.

Harm, under IER, is not defined by pain, regret, or wrongdoing. It is defined by **damage to the organization of admissible futures** and erosion of ownership capacity over time.

## 10. What This Article Does *Not* Do

This document does **not**:

* define addiction clinically,
* provide treatment guidance,
* rank substances or behaviors,
* establish diagnostic criteria,
* license coercive intervention,
* moralize recovery or relapse.

It offers structure, not instruction.

---

## 11. Summary

* Addiction is a **stable solution to intrinsic constraint**.
* Willpower is **not a mechanism**, but a costly bridge.
* Recovery is **topological reorganization**, not override.
* Moral failure is a category error.

> **Experience does not fail.

### **Intermission — Structural Fact**

> *A system does not choose its cheapest resolution.
> It arrives there because alternatives no longer fit.*
