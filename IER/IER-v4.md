# **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v4 – Technical)**

### *A Framework for Physical Reality, Observers, and Conscious Experience*

---

## **Introduction**

Physical reality exists independently of observers. Events, states, and laws unfold regardless of observation. Within this reality, some physical systems organize information about their environment, monitor their own internal state, and regulate their behavior.

A subset of these systems also exhibits conscious experience.

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER)** provides a framework explaining how consciousness arises from physical systems. Observers are defined by the organization of information, and conscious experience arises in systems capable of **integrated modeling of the world and the system itself over time**. Consciousness is real but **non-fundamental**, emerging only under specific organizational conditions.

---

## **1. Objective Reality**

Reality is observer-independent. Physical processes occur irrespective of perception or representation. Observers do not create or alter reality through awareness or perspective. Only **physical interactions between systems** exert causal influence in the world.

Experience does not modify reality; it is **the system’s internal representation of reality**.

---

## **2. Observers as Informational Systems**

An **observer** is a system that organizes information in a way that enables internal representation of both its environment and its own state.

A system qualifies as an observer if it can:

* maintain a coherent pattern of information over time
* integrate information across subsystems
* construct internal models of the environment and of its own state
* update these models based on ongoing interaction with the environment

Observerhood exists along a **continuum** and can be instantiated in biological or artificial systems. Consciousness is **not a necessary condition** for observerhood.

---

## **3. Internal Models and Perspective**

Observers construct **internal informational models** representing features of the world and the system itself. These models are:

* physically instantiated in the system
* entirely internal to the system
* constrained by the system’s structure, history, and dynamics

Perspective is a property of **internal information organization**, not of reality itself. Different observers may model the same reality differently without affecting it.

---

## **4. From Observation to Experience**

Not all observers are conscious. Conscious experience arises only in systems capable of **coordinated, integrated self- and world-modeling** over time. Observing and processing information alone is insufficient for consciousness.

---

## **5. Consciousness and the Phenomenal Information Layer**

Conscious experience corresponds to a **Phenomenal Information Layer (PIL)**, a functional regime characterized by:

* recursive access to internal models
* temporal continuity of informational states
* global integration across subsystems
* availability of information for regulation, learning, and action

The PIL is not a separate substance or ontological layer. Conscious experience is the **manifestation of this integrated informational structure** within the system.

---

## **6. Qualia**

Qualia are system-relative informational states defined by their structure and integration. They are:

* physically instantiated in the system
* accessible only to the system itself
* differentiated by patterns of integration and internal availability

Qualia are not intrinsic properties of the external world. Their apparent privacy arises from exclusive access by the system in which they are instantiated.

---

## **7. Affect and Valence**

Affective states arise from **regulatory informational processes** that:

* monitor conditions relevant to system stability
* bias attention, learning, and behavior
* assign salience and priority to internal states

Pain, pleasure, and other valence signals are **functionally real informational states** that guide the system’s organization. Affect reflects the internal manifestation of these regulatory dynamics.

---

## **8. Emergence and Constraints**

Consciousness is **emergent but constrained**. It arises only when a system exhibits:

* integration across subsystems
* recursive self-modeling
* temporal continuity
* coordinated access to information for control and regulation

Many complex systems fail to meet these criteria and thus do not experience consciousness.

## **9. System Taxonomy**

### **IER v4 – Technical System Taxonomy**

| **System Type**                        | **Observerhood** | **Integrated Self-Models** | **Consciousness Likelihood** | **Examples**                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Non-informational physical systems     | ❌                | ❌                          | ❌                            | Rocks, stars                   |
| Dynamically complex non-observers      | ❌                | ❌                          | ❌                            | Storms, flames                 |

| Minimal observers                      | ✅ (limited)      | ⚠️                         | Low–Indeterminate            | Bees, simple autonomous robots |
| Highly integrated biological observers | ✅                | ✅                          | Moderate–High                | Octopi                         |

| Aggregate social systems               | ❌                | ❌                          | ❌                            | Global wheat market            |

❌ = absent, ⚠️ = partial/limited, ✅ = clearly present

## **10. Non-Human Biological Systems**

Non-human organisms vary in observer and consciousness capacities. Systems with limited integration or modular information processing may qualify as observers without sustaining conscious experience. Systems with widespread integration, flexible learning, and unified regulation are more likely to experience consciousness.

Consciousness depends on **functional organization**, not species membership.

---

## **11. Reality and Layering**

IER rejects layered ontologies, mind-dependent existence, and observer-generated worlds. There is **one objective physical reality**, and internal informational processes occur **within** systems embedded in that reality. Conscious experience is **internal and system-bound**.

---

## **Conclusion**

Informational Experiential Realism provides a precise account linking physical reality, observerhood, and conscious experience. Consciousness is **not fundamental**, but emerges when information flows through a system capable of integrated modeling of the world and itself, sustained over time.

Some systems react.
Some observe.
Some experience.

IER explains **how and why**.
