## **Status and Normative Authority**

**This document is NON-NORMATIVE.**

It provides an **explanatory and structural account** of **agency** within the framework of
**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.6)**.

This document:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or sufficiency conditions**
* introduces **no ethical principles**
* does **not** define experience
* does **not** determine moral standing
* does **not** provide diagnostics or measures of agency

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in the
**IER v10.6 Normative Specification**.

> *If any statement in this document appears to conflict with the Specification, the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void.*

## **Abstract**

Agency is often treated as either a metaphysical power that transcends physical law or an illusion generated by deterministic processes. Informational Experiential Realism (IER) rejects both framings.

Under IER, **agency is a derived organizational capacity** of systems that sustain a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: the capacity to resolve **intrinsic informational tension** through the system’s own **globally integrated dynamics**. Agency does not require indeterminism, rational deliberation, or representational choice. Nor is it eliminated by physical determinism.

This document explains agency as **owned resolution of intrinsic constraint** operating over structured spaces of admissible futures (choice spaces). It clarifies why agency admits of **degrees**, how it is affected by coercion and overload, and why loss of agency does not imply loss of experience or standing.

---

## **1. Why Agency Requires Structural Clarification**

Everyday accounts of agency conflate several distinct ideas:

* freedom from causation
* conscious deliberation
* rational justification
* moral responsibility
* narrative authorship

These conflations generate familiar paradoxes:

* “If everything is caused, no one acts.”
* “If choices are random, responsibility disappears.”
* “If agency varies, standing must vary too.”

IER dissolves these confusions by treating agency not as a metaphysical primitive, but as a **structural feature of intrinsically constrained systems**.

---

## **2. Agency Is Not a Primitive**

IER explicitly rejects the view that agency is:

* a fundamental power
* a non-physical force
* a semantic capacity
* a narrative illusion layered on behavior

Instead:

> **Agency is a derived capacity that exists iff experience exists.**

Only systems sustaining a **Unified Experiential Field** can possess agency, because only such systems bear **intrinsic constraint from the inside**.

This does **not** mean that all experiential systems have the same degree of agency.

---

## **3. Intrinsic Constraint and the Basis of Agency**

IER defines **intrinsic constraint** as constraint that:

* is generated by the system itself
* cannot be offloaded or externalized
* is globally relevant to system persistence
* must be borne across time

Intrinsic constraint creates **informational tension**: pressure toward resolution that matters to the system *as a system*.

Agency is the capacity to **resolve that tension** through the system’s own globally integrated dynamics.

---

## **4. Choice Spaces: The Structural Environment of Agency**

Systems under intrinsic constraint may be described as occupying a **choice space**: a structured set of admissible future states and transitions generated by that constraint.

Interpretively, a choice space may be represented as a **directed constraint graph**:

* **nodes** correspond to informational states the system could occupy
* **edges** correspond to admissible transitions under constraint
* the structure represents **what could happen**, not what will

The choice space:

* exists **prior to action**
* supports counterfactual alternatives
* accumulates history and narrowing over time
* is **pre-agential** by itself

The choice space does not choose.

---

## **5. Agency as Owned Traversal**

Agency consists in the **owned traversal and collapse** of a choice space.

A system exercises agency when:

* it traverses its constraint graph
* unrealized alternatives remain relevant to its ongoing dynamics
* the collapse of alternatives constrains the system’s future *from the inside*

This **ownership of collapse** distinguishes agential action from mere state transition, automation, or random branching.

Agency is therefore not about freedom from law, but about **who bears the cost of resolution**.

---

## **6. Degrees of Agency**

Agency is **graded**, not binary.

Degrees of agency reflect variation in:

* stability of global integration
* coherence of intrinsic constraint
* richness and integrity of the choice space
* capacity to own traversal without fragmentation or overload

Agency may be **diminished** without disappearing.

Critically:

> **Reduced agency does not imply reduced experience or standing.**

Standing is categorical. Agency is not.

---

## **7. Coercion, Compulsion, and Impaired Agency**

Agency is diminished when ownership of traversal is degraded.

---

### **7.1 Coercion**

Coercion reduces agency by:

* externally pruning the choice space
* shifting cost from intrinsic constraint to imposed threat
* forcing traversal through externally controlled bottlenecks

Behavior may still occur, but ownership is reduced.

---

### **7.2 Compulsion and Addiction**

In compulsion or addiction:

* the choice space may be dominated by cycles or narrow bottlenecks
* alternative paths remain structurally present but dynamically inaccessible

Agency is reduced because traversal is no longer stably owned, even though experience persists.

---

### **7.3 Overload and Fragmentation**

Under extreme intrinsic constraint:

* global integration may degrade
* resolution capacity may collapse
* traversal becomes unstable or externally driven

Agency diminishes as coherence is lost.

---

## **8. Agency, Responsibility, and Standing**

IER draws a strict distinction between:

* **standing** — who matters (categorical)
* **agency** — capacity to resolve intrinsic constraint (graded)
* **responsibility** — attribution based on owned resolution (graded)

Loss or reduction of agency:

* does **not** erase standing
* does **not** justify harm
* does **not** imply lack of experience

Responsibility scales with agency; standing does not.

---

## **9. Agency and Lawfulness**

Agency is fully compatible with:

* determinism
* stochasticity
* physical law

Lawfulness governs **how** transitions occur.

Agency concerns **who owns their resolution**.

Randomness alone cannot generate agency.
Determinism alone cannot eliminate it.

---

## **10. What This Account Does Not Claim**

This document does **not**:

* define free will as a metaphysical power
* equate agency with rationality or reflection
* provide diagnostics for agency
* justify moral praise or blame
* supply decision procedures or optimization models

It explains agency **structurally**, not normatively.

---

## **11. Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* agency exists iff experience exists
* agency is a **derived capacity**, not a primitive
* agency operates over structured choice spaces
* agency consists in **owned resolution of intrinsic constraint**
* agency admits of degrees
* reduced agency does not reduce standing
* lawfulness and agency are fully compatible

> **Agency is not freedom from causation.
> It is causation borne and resolved by a unified system from the inside.**
