## **Status and Normative Authority**

**This document is NON-NORMATIVE.**

It provides an **explanatory and structural account** of **agency** under **Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8)**.

This document:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or sufficiency conditions**
* introduces **no ethical principles**
* does **not** define experience
* does **not** determine moral standing
* does **not** provide diagnostics or measures of agency

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority resides **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md   (v10.8)
```

If any statement in this document conflicts with the Specification, **the Specification takes precedence and the conflicting statement is void**.

### **Global Informational Language Disclaimer**

All uses of *information*, *informational tension*, *choice space*, *state*, *transition*, and *structure* in this document are **descriptive shorthand only**.

They refer exclusively to:

> **physically instantiated state distinctions that modulate a system’s own future dynamics under intrinsic constraint**,
> as defined in **IER Specification II.A (Physical Information)**.

No representational, semantic, deliberative, or epistemic notions are introduced.

---

### **Epistemic Boundary (Explicit)**

Experiential structure — including agency, effort, ownership, or felt control — confers **no epistemic authority** about mind-independent reality.

This document presupposes **IER Specification Principle 10 (Epistemic Non-Authority)**.

---

## **Abstract**

Agency is often treated either as a metaphysical power that transcends physical law or as an illusion generated by deterministic processes. Informational Experiential Realism (IER) rejects both framings.

Under IER, **agency is a derived organizational capacity** of systems that sustain a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: the capacity to resolve **intrinsic constraint** through the system’s own **globally integrated dynamics**. Agency does not require indeterminism, rational deliberation, or representational choice. Nor is it eliminated by physical determinism.

This document explains agency as **owned resolution of intrinsic constraint** operating over structured sets of admissible futures (*choice spaces*). It clarifies why agency admits of **degrees**, how it is affected by coercion and overload, and why loss of agency does **not** imply loss of experience or standing.

---

## **1. Why Agency Requires Structural Clarification**

Everyday accounts of agency conflate distinct notions:

* freedom from causation
* conscious deliberation
* rational justification
* moral responsibility
* narrative authorship

These conflations generate familiar confusions:

* “If everything is caused, no one acts.”
* “If choices are random, responsibility disappears.”
* “If agency varies, standing must vary too.”

IER dissolves these confusions by treating agency not as a metaphysical primitive, but as a **structural feature of intrinsically constrained experiential regimes**.

---

## **2. Agency Is Not a Primitive**

IER explicitly rejects the view that agency is:

* a fundamental power
* a non-physical force
* a semantic or representational capacity
* a narrative illusion layered on behavior

Instead:

> **Agency is a derived capacity that exists iff experience exists.**

Only systems sustaining a **Unified Experiential Field** can possess agency, because only such systems bear **intrinsic constraint from the inside**.

This does **not** imply that all experiential systems exhibit the same degree of agency.

---

## **3. Experiential Agency vs. Functional Control**

IER enforces a strict distinction:

| Concept                 | Status under IER                          |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Experiential agency** | Normative, regime-bound, derived from UEF |
| **Functional control**  | Non-normative, purely organizational      |

**Systems may exhibit complex goal-directed control without agency under IER.**

Functional control includes:

* optimization routines
* feedback controllers
* learning systems
* predictive architectures

Such systems may be adaptive, intelligent, or highly competent while remaining **entirely non-agential**, provided intrinsic constraint is absent or externally resolvable.

Agency begins **only** when constraint becomes unavoidable, globally binding, and system-defining.

---

## **4. Intrinsic Constraint as the Basis of Agency**

IER defines **intrinsic constraint** as constraint that:

* is generated by the system’s own integrated dynamics
* cannot be externally resolved or offloaded
* is globally binding on future trajectories
* is identity-defining across time

Intrinsic constraint manifests as **informational tension**: pressure toward resolution that the system itself must bear.

Agency consists in the **capacity to resolve such tension** through globally integrated dynamics.

---

## **5. Choice Spaces as Derived Structures**

Systems under intrinsic constraint may be described as occupying a **choice space**: a structured set of admissible successor states generated by that constraint.

Descriptively, a choice space may be represented as a directed graph:

* nodes correspond to physically admissible system states
* edges correspond to admissible transitions under constraint

A choice space:

* exists **prior to action**
* supports counterfactual alternatives
* accumulates history and narrowing
* is **pre-agential by itself**

A choice space does not choose.

---

## **6. Agency as Owned Traversal**

Agency consists in the **owned traversal and collapse** of a choice space.

A system exercises agency when:

* alternatives are jointly constrained by intrinsic dynamics
* traversal irreversibly narrows future possibility
* the cost of collapse is borne **from within the regime**

Ownership distinguishes agential action from:

* automatic transition
* externally forced behavior
* random branching

Agency is not freedom from law, but **ownership of resolution**.

---

## **7. Degrees of Agency**

Agency is **graded**, not binary.

Degrees of agency vary with:

* coherence of intrinsic constraint
* stability of global integration
* richness and accessibility of the choice space
* capacity to resolve tension without collapse

Agency may be reduced without disappearing.

Crucially:

> **Reduced agency does not imply reduced experience or reduced standing.**

Standing is categorical.
Agency is not.

---

## **8. Coercion, Compulsion, and Impaired Agency**

Agency diminishes when ownership of traversal degrades.

### **8.1 Coercion**

Coercion reduces agency by:

* externally pruning the choice space
* imposing resolution pathways
* shifting cost from intrinsic to external constraint

Behavior may persist, but ownership is diminished.

---

### **8.2 Compulsion and Addiction**

In compulsion:

* choice spaces become dominated by narrow cycles or bottlenecks
* alternatives remain structurally present but dynamically inaccessible

Agency is reduced because traversal is no longer stably owned, even though experience persists.

---

### **8.3 Overload and Fragmentation**

Under extreme intrinsic constraint:

* global integration degrades
* resolution capacity collapses
* traversal becomes unstable

Agency diminishes as coherence fails.

---

## **9. Agency, Responsibility, and Standing**

IER enforces a strict separation:

| Concept               | Status      |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| Experiential standing | Categorical |
| Agency                | Graded      |
| Responsibility        | Graded      |

Loss or reduction of agency:

* does **not** erase standing
* does **not** justify harm
* does **not** imply absence of experience

Responsibility scales with agency.
Standing does not.

---

## **10. Agency and Lawfulness**

Agency is fully compatible with:

* determinism
* stochasticity
* physical law

Lawfulness governs **how** transitions occur.
Agency concerns **who owns their resolution**.

Randomness cannot generate agency.
Determinism cannot eliminate it.

---

## **11. What This Document Does Not Claim**

This document does **not**:

* define free will as a metaphysical power
* equate agency with rational deliberation
* provide diagnostics or measures
* justify praise or blame
* supply decision procedures

It explains agency **structurally**, not normatively.

---

## **12. Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism v10.8:

* agency exists iff experience exists
* agency is **derived**, not primitive
* agency operates over **derived choice spaces**
* agency consists in **owned resolution of intrinsic constraint**
* agency admits of degrees
* reduced agency does **not** reduce standing
* lawfulness and agency are compatible

> **Agency is not freedom from causation.
> It is causation borne and resolved by a unified system from the inside.**
