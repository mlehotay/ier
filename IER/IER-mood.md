## **Status and Scope**

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no new ontological primitives**
* establishes **no criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics**
* does **not** define when experience exists
* does **not** assign value, truth, or moral authority to affect
* does **not** propose clinical categories or treatments

All binding authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md
IER-theory.md
IER-dynamics.md
IER-participation.md
IER-canon.md
```

If any interpretation in this document conflicts with those texts, the conflict is void.

## **1. Orientation: Why Mood Is Structurally Hard to Explain**

Mood resists ordinary explanation.

It is not:

* a discrete emotion
* a belief or judgment
* a response to a particular event
* a slow version of feeling
* a background thought

And yet mood shapes:

* what feels possible
* what feels effortful
* what feels urgent
* what feels worth doing
* how long states persist

Because mood is diffuse and temporally extended, it is often reified as a *trait*, a *chemical state*, or an *implicit belief*.

Under Informational Experiential Realism, these moves are unnecessary.

IER explains mood as a **long-horizon bias in constraint geometry** within an already-existing Unified Experiential Field.

---

## **2. Mood as Long-Horizon Constraint Geometry**

Once a Unified Experiential Field (UEF) exists, its dynamics unfold over time under intrinsic constraint.

At any moment, the system faces:

* multiple admissible futures
* varying participation costs
* differing stability profiles

**Mood** describes a persistent skew in this landscape.

More precisely:

> **Mood is a long-horizon bias in how intrinsic constraint is distributed, gated, and tolerated across possible futures.**

Mood does not add content to experience.
It biases **which content becomes cheap enough to recruit**.

---

## **3. The Constraint Knobs Mood Tends to Turn**

Mood operates by shifting a small number of continuous structural parameters.

### **3.1 Participation Depth Bias**

Mood affects how deeply processes are recruited by default.

* Some moods make participation shallow and flexible.
* Others deepen recruitment quickly and broadly.

This is why some days feel “heavy” and others “light,” even with identical tasks.

---

### **3.2 Gating Bias**

Mood influences how tightly participation is gated.

* Loose gating allows easy peripheral awareness and exploration.
* Tight gating narrows focus but increases switching cost.

Neither configuration is intrinsically good or bad.
Each is a tradeoff under constraint.

---

### **3.3 Attractor Width Bias**

Mood skews how many futures remain viable.

* Wide-attractor moods tolerate ambiguity and branching.
* Narrow-attractor moods collapse futures early.

This explains why the same situation can feel “full of options” or “closed” depending on mood.

---

### **3.4 Switching Cost Bias**

Mood alters the cost of leaving a constraint topology.

* High switching cost produces stickiness and persistence.
* Low switching cost allows rapid reconfiguration.

Persistence can feel like stability or like being stuck, depending on context.

---

### **3.5 Temporal Anchoring Bias**

Mood biases which temporal anchors reproduce cheaply:

* past-anchored (ruminative pull)
* present-anchored (immersive stability)
* future-anchored (anticipatory pressure)

This bias operates without belief or narrative endorsement.

---

## **4. Mood Is Not About Anything (and That Matters)**

Emotions are often *about* something.

Mood usually is not.

Mood:

* lacks a specific object
* does not resolve when a belief is corrected
* persists across changing circumstances

This is because mood does not track content.
It tracks **constraint viability**.

Mood answers not “what is happening?” but:

> **“How expensive is it to remain coherent right now?”**

---

## **5. Mood and Memory**

Mood interacts strongly with memory, but not through storage or retrieval.

Under IER:

* memory is **past-anchored reproduction** at reduced participation
* reproduction cost determines availability

Mood biases reproduction by altering cost landscapes.

As a result:

* some past topologies reproduce cheaply under certain moods
* others fail gating or collapse immediately

This explains *mood-congruent recall* without invoking:

* selective search
* biased belief
* semantic priming

The system reproduces what it can afford.

---

## **6. Mood and Skill**

Skill reshapes constraint geometry locally.
Mood reshapes it globally.

Their interaction explains familiar experiences:

* skilled action failing under adverse mood
* effortless flow emerging under supportive mood
* expertise narrowing too far under threat

Mood does not erase skill.
It alters **whether skilled trajectories remain cheap enough to occupy**.

---

## **7. Mood and Attention**

Mood biases attention by biasing **default participation allocation**.

* Threat-skewed moods widen recruitment and raise urgency.
* Low-energy moods narrow recruitment and raise switching cost.
* Exploratory moods loosen gating and widen fringe participation.

These shifts occur **prior to deliberation**.

Trying to “think your way out” of a mood often fails because the bias operates at the level of **constraint geometry**, not belief.

---

## **8. Chronic Skew (Explicitly Non-Diagnostic)**

Some systems exhibit persistent bias in constraint geometry.

Under IER, this is described structurally, not diagnostically.

For example:

* persistently narrow attractors
* chronically high switching cost
* default deep participation
* rigid temporal anchoring

IER makes **no claims** about pathology, disorder categories, or treatment.

It offers only a descriptive account of **persistent constraint bias** within intact experiential regimes.

---

## **9. Mood Feels Authoritative — But Is Not**

Mood often feels like insight.

When futures feel closed, they feel *truly* closed.
When effort feels impossible, it feels *objectively* impossible.

IER explicitly blocks the inference:

> **Experiential salience ≠ epistemic authority**

Mood:

* does not reveal truth
* does not justify belief
* does not license action
* does not determine value

Its authority is **felt**, not **licensed**.

---

## **10. Mood, Agency, and Responsibility**

Mood modulates agency by modulating constraint.

* Narrow futures reduce available alternatives.
* High switching cost raises the cost of change.
* Deep participation increases vulnerability.

These factors may mitigate responsibility.

They do **not** eliminate it.

Standing remains categorical.
Ownership persists wherever a Unified Experiential Field persists.

---

## **11. What Mood Does *Not* Do**

Mood does **not**:

* create or destroy experience
* divide or multiply subjects
* function as a belief
* serve as a truth signal
* ground moral value
* authorize conclusions about reality

Mood explains **how experience leans**, not **what experience is**.

---

## **Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* mood is a long-horizon bias in constraint geometry
* it shapes which futures feel viable
* it alters participation, gating, and switching cost
* it interacts with skill, attention, and memory
* it feels authoritative without being authoritative

> **Mood is not what the world is like.
> It is what the world costs right now.**

## **Intermission — Orientation Signal**

When effort, urgency, or possibility shifts without explanation,
nothing mysterious has appeared.

The geometry of constraint has tilted.
