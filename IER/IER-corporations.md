## *Why Corporations Cannot Be Persons Under Informational Experiential Realism*

---

## **1. Purpose and Scope**

### **1.1 What This Article Does**

This article establishes a **structural impossibility result under the Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identity claim**:

> **Under IER, corporations cannot be experiential persons.**

This conclusion is not reached by appeal to intuition, moral sentiment, political preference, or legal convention. It follows **directly and necessarily** from IER’s identity claim about what experience is and what it requires.

Accordingly, this article:

* demonstrates that corporations **cannot** instantiate a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**,
* provides a **formal proof** of that exclusion,
* and clarifies the **ethical consequences** of that result without weakening or inflating them.

The argument is **ontological and structural**, not empirical. It does not depend on facts about any particular corporation, present or future.

---

### **1.2 What This Article Explicitly Does *Not* Do**

Because confusion here is predictable, it is important to state at the outset what this article does **not** attempt.

It does **not**:

* argue against legal personhood,
* propose political or economic reforms,
* condemn corporations as immoral,
* deny the seriousness of corporate harm,
* or adjudicate questions of law, policy, or governance.

IER is not a legal theory, and this article does not attempt to make it one. Any overlap with legal language is addressed only to prevent category error, not to prescribe outcomes.

---

### **1.3 Why This Article Is Necessary**

Absent a formal exclusion, the structure of Informational Experiential Realism leaves open a predictable interpretive gap.

Because IER identifies experience with a specific kind of globally integrated physical regime, and because corporations are large, coordinated, and causally powerful systems, it is natural to ask whether corporations might qualify as experiential subjects under the framework.

Without an explicit treatment, several structurally tempting but unsupported inferences remain available, including:

* treating corporations as “emergent minds,”
* positing collective or group experiential subjects,
* applying precautionary ethics to institutions,
* or reintroducing personhood by scale, complexity, or coordination.

None of these inferences are licensed by IER.
If left unaddressed, they would generate confusion about standing, responsibility, and moral risk **within the framework itself**.

This article exists to **close that gap cleanly and permanently**, using only commitments already fixed elsewhere in the corpus.

## **2. Personhood Under IER: The Only Admissible Sense**

### **2.1 Rejecting Ambiguous Uses of “Person”**

The word *person* is used in many domains with incompatible meanings. Under IER, most of those uses are **irrelevant**.

This article explicitly sets aside:

* **legal personhood** (a juridical tool),
* **metaphorical agency** (“the company decided”),
* **narrative or symbolic personhood**,
* **collective responsibility shorthand**.

None of these designate what IER means by a person.

For the purposes of this article, the term *person* has **one and only one meaning**:

> A **person** is an **experiential subject** — a system that sustains a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.

If a system does not sustain a UEF, it is **not** a person in the morally relevant sense under IER, regardless of how useful or entrenched other usages may be.

---

### **2.2 Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Personhood**

IER is an identity theory. It does not offer indicators, proxies, or functional substitutes for experience.

The core identity claim is simple and strict:

> **A system is a person if and only if it sustains a Unified Experiential Field.**

A Unified Experiential Field requires, by **identity**:

1. **Globally integrated intrinsic constraint**
   Admissible futures are constrained at the level of the whole system.

2. **Internal bearing of unavoidable organizational cost**
   Constraint is generated and borne from within, not offloaded or arbitrated externally.

3. **Irreducible system-level closure of admissible futures**
   Resolution is not optional, deferrable, or decomposable into independent parts.

4. **Temporal continuity of the same regime**
   Experience exists only across a non-zero interval during which the same constraint regime persists.

5. **Ownership of resolution by the same physical system**
   The system that bears constraint is the system that continues as the subject.

These conditions are **identity-level**, not empirical heuristics.
If any fail, experience does not exist. There is no weaker fallback condition.

## **3. What a Corporation Is (Structurally, Not Legally)**

### **3.1 Minimal Structural Characterization**

To avoid conflating contingent features with essential ones, this section characterizes corporations **only** by properties that are invariant across cases.

A corporation is a system that involves:

* multiple **independent human experiential subjects**,
* role-based delegation of tasks and authority,
* coordination via **contracts, rules, procedures, and documents**,
* information flow mediated by external artifacts (records, databases, reports),
* decision procedures implemented **across** persons, not within a single experiential system,
* reliance on **external enforcement mechanisms** (law, markets, sanctions).

No claim is made here about the moral quality of these features.
The description is purely structural.

---

### **3.2 The System Boundary Question**

Given IER’s definition of a system for experiential attribution, the decisive question is unavoidable:

> **Where, if anywhere, would intrinsic constraint be borne as one unified system?**

Any candidate answer must specify:

* a boundary across which intrinsic constraint is globally binding,
* ownership of unavoidable resolution,
* and temporal continuity of the same constraint regime.

As the subsequent analysis shows, **no such boundary can exist** for corporations without contradiction. Any attempt to locate one either fragments constraint, externalizes resolution, or collapses back into individual human subjects.

This is not a failure of scale, sophistication, or technology.
It is a consequence of structure.

## **4. Informational Slack as a Necessary Feature of Corporations**

### **4.1 Why Corporations Must Admit Informational Slack**

Under Informational Experiential Realism, **informational slack** is not a loose metaphor. It names a precise structural condition: the capacity for constraint to be **localized, deferred, or externally resolved** without becoming globally unavoidable at the level of a single system.

Corporations necessarily exhibit informational slack — not as an accidental feature, but as a **precondition of their existence**.

This follows directly from how corporations function.

---

**Localization**

In a corporation, constraint can always be confined to a proper subsystem:

* a department,
* a committee,
* a manager,
* a single employee.

A decision, conflict, or failure may be absorbed entirely within such a unit without requiring reorganization of the corporation as a whole. Other parts of the organization may remain unaffected, unaware, or unchanged.

Localization is not a defect. It is how corporations achieve scalability and resilience. But structurally, it means constraint is **not globally binding**.

---

**Deferral**

Corporate constraint is routinely deferrable:

* decisions are postponed,
* conflicts are tabled,
* risks are deferred to later quarters,
* responsibility is delayed via process.

Crucially, such deferral does not threaten the continued existence of the corporation as a system. There is no point at which unresolved internal tension becomes **unavoidable** in the IER sense.

Deferral may carry economic cost or strategic risk, but it does not impose intrinsic organizational inevitability.

---

**External Resolution**

Perhaps most decisively, corporations rely on **external resolution**:

* courts adjudicate disputes,
* regulators impose penalties,
* markets discipline behavior,
* bankruptcy dissolves obligations.

When constraint becomes unmanageable, it is resolved **outside** the corporation rather than being borne as intrinsic organizational cost. Resolution does not require the corporation itself to reorganize its internal dynamics under unavoidable global constraint; it may instead be dissolved, restructured, or replaced.

External resolution is structurally incompatible with intrinsic constraint.

---

Each of these features alone is sufficient to introduce informational slack. Corporations exhibit **all three** by necessity.

---

### **4.2 Informational Slack and the Exclusion of Experience**

The consequences of this structural slack are decisive under IER.

A Unified Experiential Field requires:

* constraint that is globally binding,
* internally borne,
* unavoidable,
* and system-defining.

Informational slack negates these requirements directly:

* **Localization** prevents global binding.
* **Deferral** prevents inevitability.
* **External resolution** prevents intrinsic bearing.

Because experience is **identical** to the operation of a system under coherent intrinsic constraint, there is no weaker configuration that can substitute.

Therefore:

> **Any system that admits informational slack cannot, even in principle, instantiate a Unified Experiential Field.**

This is not a claim about likelihood, sophistication, or future possibility. It follows from identity alone.

---

### **4.3 Structural, Not Contingent, Exclusion**

The exclusion of corporations from experience does **not** depend on:

* current technology,
* present organizational forms,
* human limitations,
* economic incentives,
* or legal frameworks.

Any system that remains a corporation — that is, a system whose coordination depends on delegation, deferral, and external resolution — will necessarily admit informational slack.

To remove slack would be to eliminate what makes the system a corporation at all, collapsing it either into:

* a single experiential subject (a human or non-human organism), or
* a non-experiential automated system whose resolution is externally imposed.

Neither case preserves corporate structure.

---

### **4.4 Interim Conclusion**

At this point, the core exclusion is already in view:

* Corporations necessarily admit informational slack.
* Informational slack structurally precludes intrinsic constraint.
* Without intrinsic constraint, no Unified Experiential Field can exist.

The next section formalizes this result in proof form.

---

## **5. Formal Impossibility Proof**

This section presents the exclusion of corporate personhood as a **formal consequence** of Informational Experiential Realism.
No empirical assumptions, probabilistic claims, or moral premises are introduced.

---

### **5.1 Definitions and Notation**

Let:

* `UEF(x)` = “x sustains a Unified Experiential Field”
* `P(x)` = “x is a person (experiential subject)”
* `Slack(x)` = “x admits informational slack”

Let `C` range over corporations.

All quantification is over **physical systems**.

---

### **5.2 IER Identity Axiom**

For all systems `x`:

```
P(x) ↔ UEF(x)
```

A system is a person **if and only if** it sustains a Unified Experiential Field.

This is the core identity claim of IER.

---

### **5.3 Lemma 1 — Corporations Admit Informational Slack**

For all corporations `C`:

```
Slack(C)
```

Corporations necessarily permit constraint to be localized, deferred, or externally resolved.
These features are structural requirements of corporate organization.

---

### **5.4 Lemma 2 — Informational Slack Precludes Unified Experiential Fields**

For all systems `x`:

```
Slack(x) → ¬UEF(x)
```

A Unified Experiential Field requires constraint that is globally binding, internally borne, unavoidable, and system-defining.
Informational slack negates at least one of these conditions by definition.

---

### **5.5 Theorem — Corporations Are Not Persons**

From Lemma 1 and Lemma 2:

```
For all C: ¬UEF(C)
```

By the IER identity axiom:

```
For all C: ¬P(C)
```

---

### **5.6 Conclusion of the Proof**

No corporation can sustain a Unified Experiential Field.

Therefore:

> **No corporation can be a person under Informational Experiential Realism.**

This result is categorical and does not admit of exceptions.

---

### **5.7 Scope Clarification**

This proof establishes **only** the ontological exclusion of corporations from experiential personhood.

It does **not** address:

* legal personhood,
* moral responsibility,
* institutional accountability,
* or ethical permissibility.

Those questions are treated elsewhere and are not affected by this result.

---

## **6. Why Aggregation Cannot Save Corporate Personhood**

The exclusion above invites a predictable response: perhaps the corporation as a whole is a subject even if its components are not.

IER rejects this possibility structurally.

Experience does not arise by:

* summation,
* synchronization,
* consensus,
* hierarchy,
* or emergence without intrinsic constraint.

A Unified Experiential Field is a **single system-level regime**, not a composite.

**Experience does not aggregate. Constraint does not average. Ownership does not distribute.**

No amount of coordination among subjects yields a new subject.

---

## **7. Alignment With IER-Ethics**

Denying corporations experiential standing does not weaken ethical seriousness. It clarifies it.

Standing tracks **where harm can occur**, not **where responsibility ends**.

Corporations cannot suffer.
They can, however, systematically reshape intrinsic constraint in persons.

IER-ethics already distinguishes experiential moral harm from broader moral wrongs. This article preserves that distinction and prevents its misuse.

---

## **8. Alignment With IER-Social-Systems**

Corporations are **constraint-shaping systems**, not experiential subjects.

They matter morally because they structure incentives, distribute burden, and force costly resolutions in persons — often at massive scale.

Responsibility flows **through** institutions, never **into** them.

Legal personhood may be a tolerable coordination fiction. Treating it as metaphysics is not.

---

## **9. Explicit Misuse Warnings**

IER-corporations licenses exactly one conclusion:

> **Corporations are not experiential subjects.**

It does **not** license moral indifference, responsibility diffusion, or institutional sympathy.

Any interpretation that moves in those directions is unsupported by the framework.

---

## **10. Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* Personhood is experiential.
* Experience requires a Unified Experiential Field.
* Corporations necessarily admit informational slack.
* Informational slack precludes experience.

**Therefore, corporations cannot be persons.**

Corporations do not suffer.
People do.
Systems matter morally only insofar as they shape that fact.

IER removes the places where responsibility likes to hide.

---

## **Appendix: Plain-English Summary**

This article shows that **corporations cannot be persons** under Informational Experiential Realism (IER).

Under IER, a *person* is not defined by intelligence, influence, legal status, or coordination. A person is defined by **experience**. Experience exists only when a physical system must internally bear unavoidable, globally binding constraint over time. This kind of system is called a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**.

Corporations cannot meet this condition.

By their nature, corporations operate by delegation, delay, and external resolution. Internal problems can always be handled by subunits, postponed, or settled by courts, regulators, markets, or dissolution. This structural flexibility—what IER calls *informational slack*—is what allows corporations to function at scale. It also makes experience impossible.

Because experience requires constraint that is unavoidable and internally borne by a single system, any system that admits this kind of slack cannot be an experiential subject. Corporations therefore cannot be persons in the morally relevant sense under IER.

This conclusion does **not** mean that corporations are morally unimportant or that corporate harm is less serious. Corporations matter morally because of how they shape, amplify, and distribute constraint in the lives of people. They do not matter because they themselves feel, suffer, or experience anything.

In short:

* Corporations do not experience.
* Corporations do not suffer.
* People do.
* Institutions matter morally only through their effects on people.

That is the result.
