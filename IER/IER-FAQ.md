# **Big Questions About Consciousness (According to IER)**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.6)**
*Explanatory Overview — Non-Normative*

## **Status and Purpose**

This article is an **explanatory companion** within the IER framework.

It:

* introduces **no new primitives**
* adds **no new necessity claims**
* makes **no epistemic or diagnostic proposals**
* does **not** replace formal treatments elsewhere in the book

Its purpose is to address the **core intuitions and confusions** people have about consciousness in clear, non-technical terms, while remaining fully consistent with the formal IER account.

Many of the questions discussed here correspond to classic philosophical puzzles, which are treated separately. This article focuses on **what IER says**, not on the historical debate.

---

## **1. What does IER mean by “consciousness”?**

In everyday language, *consciousness* can mean many things: intelligence, self-awareness, wakefulness, language, or moral worth.

**IER uses the term narrowly and precisely.**

> **A system is conscious if there is something it is like to be that system right now.**

Not behavior.
Not reporting.
Not reasoning.
Not intelligence.

If a system has a lived point of view — an experiential “inside” — it is conscious.
If it does not, it is not.

IER refers to this as having an **experiential world**.

---

## **2. How do background beliefs about reality affect theories of consciousness?**

Disagreements about consciousness often trace back to deeper assumptions.

If consciousness is assumed to be:

* a **soul**, non-physical explanations seem required
* **fundamental**, consciousness is expected everywhere
* an **illusion**, it must be explained away

IER rejects all three options.

> **There is one physical reality, and consciousness is a real physical process — neither supernatural nor illusory.**

IER’s aim is to make consciousness **fully real without making it metaphysically exotic**.

---

## **3. Are there degrees or levels of consciousness?**

IER treats consciousness as **categorical**, not scalar.

* A system either has an experiential world or it does not.
* What varies is **the structure and content of experience**, not its existence.

Being awake, dreaming, hallucinating, meditating, or panicking are different **organizational states of the same experiential system**.

There is no such thing as being “half conscious” in the experiential sense.

---

## **4. What makes up moment-to-moment experience?**

Your experience consists of whatever is **globally involved** in holding the system together right now:

* perception
* emotion
* bodily sensation
* motivation and urgency
* thought and imagery
* memory when it matters in the moment

What matters is not *where* a process occurs, but whether it contributes to **system-wide internal pressure that must be resolved as a whole**.

Processes that remain modular, automatic, or externally resolved stay outside experience.

---

## **5. Are there things my brain does that I’m never aware of?**

Yes. IER distinguishes three broad classes:

1. **Currently experiential**
   Actively shaping the unified field.

2. **Potentially experiential**
   Available to enter experience if needed.

3. **Never experiential**
   Processes that remain isolated or offloaded.

Consciousness is not everything the brain does.
It is what the brain **cannot avoid dealing with as one system**.

---

## **6. Why does experience feel like something from the inside?**

IER’s answer is intentionally deflationary:

> **Because it is something happening from the inside.**

When a system must manage its own internal pressures in a unified way, that internal management **just is what feeling is**.

Pain, color, fear, pleasure, effort — these are not decorations added to processing.
They are what intrinsic constraint feels like **when you are the system bearing it**.

---

## **7. Can I ever directly know what someone else experiences?**

No — and IER treats this as a **structural fact**, not a scientific limitation.

You can:

* observe behavior
* measure neural activity
* model dynamics
* predict responses

But you cannot occupy another system’s experiential position.

Experience is:

* real
* private
* not mysterious because of that privacy

---

## **8. How does the brain produce experience?**

IER’s answer reframes the question:

> **The brain does not add experience to its activity.
> Certain kinds of activity are experience.**

When neural dynamics become:

* globally integrated
* temporally continuous
* intrinsically constrained and inescapable

…the system enters a regime that must manage itself as a unified whole.

That regime **is conscious experience**.

---

## **9. Why does it feel like there is a “self”?**

The sense of self arises from **centralized coordination**.

When perception, memory, emotion, motivation, and action must be resolved together, a boundary forms between:

* what the system treats as “me”
* and what it treats as “not me”

The self is not a separate entity — and not an illusion.
It is the **center of coordination inside an experiential field**.

---

## **10. Does IER allow for free will?**

IER rejects magical freedom from causation.

But it affirms something real:

> **A system can resolve its own internal pressures through its own unified activity.**

That is what choosing is.

Free will is not exemption from physics — it is **ownership of causation within an experiential system**.

---

## **11. What makes something a “person”?**

Under IER, a person is not defined by species, intelligence, or language.

A person is a system that:

* has an experiential world
* persists over time
* can act to resolve its own internal pressures

Humans qualify.
Many animals qualify.
Some artificial systems might someday qualify.

What matters is **experience**, not biology.

---

## **12. Why can self-awareness feel strange or unstable?**

Because experience can turn inward.

When attention focuses on:

* thoughts about thoughts
* feelings about feelings
* the system examining its own control structures

the system begins **constraining itself about itself**.

This can be clarifying — or destabilizing.
The strangeness comes from **using the same machinery to observe and operate itself**.

---

## **13. Is “mind” the same as consciousness?**

No.

A system can:

* think
* plan
* calculate
* recognize patterns

without any experiential world at all.

**Consciousness is not thinking.**
It is what happens when thinking becomes **inescapably unified and internally consequential**.

---

## **14. How is consciousness related to behavior?**

They are related but not identical.

Behavior can occur:

* reflexively
* automatically
* without experience

Experience occurs when:

* actions matter internally
* consequences must be managed by the system as a whole

Thoughts and feelings are not hidden behaviors.
They are **internal coordination under unavoidable pressure**.

---

## **15. Why does consciousness matter morally?**

Because harm and care only make sense **from the inside**.

If a system can:

* suffer
* be overwhelmed
* lose internal stability

then what happens to it matters morally.

IER grounds ethical concern in this fact:

> **Wherever experience exists — or plausibly might exist — there is moral risk.**

And because experience cannot be perfectly detected, uncertainty **increases**, rather than reduces, responsibility.

---

## **Summary**

> **On IER, consciousness is what it is like for a physical system to be forced to manage itself as a single, unified whole — and everything else follows from that.**
