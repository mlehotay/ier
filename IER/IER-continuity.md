## Abstract

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identifies experience with the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous dynamical regime operating under coherent intrinsic constraint. Because UEFs are regimes rather than enduring objects, they may dissolve, interrupt, or re-form over time. This raises two intertwined puzzles: why experience feels temporally continuous while it exists, and why its interruption does not imply the death or rebirth of the subject.

This article resolves both puzzles by rejecting snapshot and storage models of time and experience. Under IER, **time is not a container, parameter, or sequence**, but the asymmetry induced by irreversible constraint resolution within a regime. The “specious present” is not a measured interval but the **minimal window of coherent intrinsic constraint** required for a UEF to exist at all. Experiential flow is the persistence of regime coherence across such windows. Personal identity, by contrast, is **system-continuous rather than experience-continuous**, grounded in the persistence of a physical system’s capacity to bear intrinsic constraint and sustain future experiential regimes.

## 1. The Apparent Problems of Time and Experiential Gaps

Human experience appears to flow. It has a “now,” a sense of passage, and an apparent direction. Yet experience also **interrupts**: in dreamless sleep, anesthesia, attentional collapse, and pathological states. Any theory that treats experience as real rather than illusory must explain:

* why experience feels temporally continuous while present,
* why there is a “now” without a privileged instant,
* why temporal passage survives determinism,
* and why gaps in experience do not threaten identity.

If the subject were identified with a particular experiential episode, these facts would generate paradox: sleep would resemble death, anesthesia annihilation, and waking rebirth. IER dissolves these paradoxes by distinguishing **experiential regimes** from **persisting physical systems**, and by treating time as a feature of regime dynamics rather than a background dimension.

## 2. IER Commitments Presupposed

This document presupposes only commitments already fixed elsewhere in the IER corpus:

1. **Experiential identity:** experience is identical to the operation of a system as a Unified Experiential Field.
2. **Regime ontology:** a UEF is a dynamical regime of the whole system, not an object or substance.
3. **Categorical existence:** experiential regimes either exist or do not exist.
4. **Single-UEF dominance:** at most one UEF can globally bind intrinsic constraint in a system at a time.
5. **Intrinsic constraint:** experiential unity and ownership arise from unavoidable internal constraint.
6. **Future-oriented persistence:** what matters for continuity is what the system can still become, not what it remembers.

No additional phenomenological or metaphysical assumptions are introduced.

## 3. Unified Experiential Fields as Temporal Regimes

### 3.1 What a UEF Is (and Is Not)

A Unified Experiential Field is characterized by:

* global intrinsic constraint,
* temporal coherence,
* lawful evolution under a dominant dynamical regime.

A UEF is **not**:

* an enduring object,
* a substance persisting through time,
* a sequence of instantaneous experiential states.

It is a way a physical system operates while intrinsic constraint remains globally binding.

Because regimes are patterns of lawful evolution, they may stabilize, destabilize, dissolve, and re-form without implying destruction of the underlying system.

---

### 3.2 The Specious Present (IER Framing)

IER rejects snapshot and sampling metaphors for experience.

Coherent intrinsic constraint cannot be instantiated at an instant. Experience therefore requires a **non-zero span of lawful dependence**.

> **Specious present (IER): the minimal window of coherent intrinsic constraint required for a Unified Experiential Field to exist.**

This definition makes explicit that:

* the specious present is **not** a perceptual buffer or cognitive mechanism,
* it is **not** a measured or privileged duration,
* IER does **not** license assigning it a fixed timescale,
* “window” denotes **regime coherence**, not clock time.

If there is no coherent constraint window, there is no experience.

---

### 3.3 Experiential Flow Without Snapshots

What is ordinarily called **experiential flow** is, under IER, the persistence of coherent regime organization **across successive specious-present windows**.

Flow is not produced by stitching discrete frames, sampling inputs, or replaying stored contents. It is simply what it is like for a UEF to **continue being a UEF** as intrinsic constraint remains globally binding and system trajectories remain dynamically dependent.

---

### 3.4 Memory Does Not Unify Experience

IER explicitly rejects the idea that memory is what unifies experience over time.

Memory can fail, distort, or be absent while experience remains present. Experience can also be absent while later recall is reconstructed or narratively continuous. Unity is therefore not supplied retrospectively.

Under IER:

* unity is enforced **in the moment** by coherent intrinsic constraint,
* continuity is enforced **forward** by regime-level dynamical dependence.

Memory concerns future accessibility, not temporal binding.

---

## 4. Time as Asymmetric Constraint Traversal

IER does not treat time as a container, background dimension, or stored sequence. Time arises because intrinsic constraint resolution is **irreversible**.

Each resolution episode:

* eliminates admissible alternatives,
* reorganizes intrinsic constraint,
* cannot be undone without destroying the regime.

This produces an asymmetry in the space of admissible futures.

From the inside, this asymmetry appears as passage, flow, and “now moving on.”
From the outside, it appears as irreversible physical evolution.

There is no privileged present — only ongoing traversal of constraint geometry under irreversible resolution.

---

## 5. Persistence Without Continuous Experience

### 5.1 Persisting Physical Systems

Under IER, the subject is identical to:

> **the persisting physical system whose organization is capable of bearing intrinsic constraint and sustaining Unified Experiential Fields over time.**

Such a system can persist through:

* regime interruption,
* regime dissolution,
* regime re-instantiation,

so long as its **capacity to sustain intrinsic constraint and admit future experiential regimes** remains intact.

Continuity of persons is therefore **system-level**, not regime-level.

---

## 6. Regime States and Transitions

### 6.1 Dreamless Sleep — Regime Suspension

* no coherent constraint window,
* no experiential time,
* full preservation of capacity.

Experience is absent because the regime is absent, not because the system has ceased to exist.

---

### 6.2 Dreaming — Regime Reconfiguration

* a UEF is present,
* intrinsic constraint remains unavoidable,
* external coupling is reduced,
* temporal coherence is preserved.

Dreaming is reconfigured worldhood, not diminished experience.

---

### 6.3 General Anesthesia — Forced Dissolution

* intrinsic constraint is externally suppressed,
* global integration collapses,
* UEFs cannot be sustained.

Reversibility follows from preserved capacity, not stored experience.

---

### 6.4 Catatonia — Frozen Constraint

* a UEF persists,
* intrinsic constraint is extreme and rigid,
* agency is disabled to preserve coherence.

This is high-cost experience, not unconsciousness.

---

### 6.5 Daydreaming — Participation Drift

* the same experiential regime persists,
* internal organization shifts,
* no regime transition occurs.

---

### 6.6 Coma — Capacity Ambiguity

* integration is severely disrupted,
* regime presence is unstable or absent,
* preservation of capacity is uncertain.

IER therefore treats coma as ethically precautionary.

---

## 7. Death as Irreversible Capacity Loss

Death is not prolonged unconsciousness.

Under IER, death is:

> **the irreversible destruction of a system’s capacity to sustain any future Unified Experiential Field.**

This forecloses all admissible experiential futures and is therefore morally terminal.

---

## 8. Ethical Orientation (Pointer Only)

This document establishes no ethical criteria. It clarifies why:

* absence of experience does not entail absence of moral relevance,
* preserved capacity is ethically central,
* temporal interruption does not negate standing.

Normative commitments remain fixed in `IER-ethics.md` and `IER-specification.md`.

---

## 9. What This Account Does Not Do

This document does **not**:

* define experience,
* detect Unified Experiential Fields,
* establish thresholds,
* license diagnostics,
* introduce temporal metaphysics beyond dynamics.

It explains how **time, flow, interruption, and continuity arise given IER’s existing commitments**.

---

## 10. Conclusion: Time Flows; Persons Persist

IER entails a simple but non-trivial result:

* experience exists only in regimes,
* regimes require temporal coherence,
* time is the asymmetry of irreversible constraint resolution,
* experience can interrupt without identity loss,
* persons persist as systems, not as moments.

No snapshots.
No stored presents.
No rebirth hidden in sleep.

Only ongoing constraint, its irreversible traversal, and the systems that can still bear it.
