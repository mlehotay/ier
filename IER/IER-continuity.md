## Abstract

Informational Experiential Realism (IER) identifies experience with the operation of a physical system as a **Unified Experiential Field (UEF)**: a globally integrated, temporally continuous dynamical regime operating under coherent intrinsic constraint. Because UEFs are regime-level phenomena, they may dissolve, reconfigure, or re-form over time. This raises an apparent puzzle: if experience ceases during dreamless sleep or anesthesia and later resumes, does this imply repeated death and rebirth of the subject?

This article argues that the puzzle arises from a category error. Under IER, **experience is regime-bound, while personal identity is system-bound**. We introduce the concept of **Experiential Regime Continuity (ERC)** to formalize the distinction between temporary regime interruption and irreversible loss of experiential capacity. Using this framework, we analyze anesthesia, sleep, dreaming, coma, catatonia, and daydreaming, and sharply distinguish them from death. We show that waking from dreamless sleep is not rebirth, that experiential gaps do not threaten identity, and that moral significance tracks the preservation or annihilation of intrinsic constraint-bearing capacity rather than uninterrupted experience.

## 1. Introduction: The Problem of Experiential Gaps

Human experience is not continuous. Ordinary life includes dreamless sleep, anesthesia, attentional lapses, and pathological states in which experience appears absent or radically altered. Any theory that treats experience as real and non-illusory must therefore explain not only how experience exists, but how it can **cease without implying the destruction of the subject**.

This issue becomes especially sharp under theories that endorse **categorical experiential onset**, including Informational Experiential Realism (IER). If experience exists only when a Unified Experiential Field (UEF) exists, and if UEFs can dissolve, then what survives those dissolutions? Why is sleep not death, and waking not rebirth?

This article argues that the tension arises from a failure to distinguish **experiential regimes** from **persisting physical systems**. Once that distinction is made explicit, experiential gaps become conceptually unproblematic, identity remains continuous, and the moral landscape clarifies rather than collapses.

## 2. IER Commitments and Scope

This article presupposes the IER v10.x normative specification and introduces **no new primitives**. It relies on the following commitments:

1. **Physical monism**: all experiential facts are physically instantiated.
2. **Experiential identity**: experience is identical to the operation of a system as a UEF.
3. **Regime character**: a UEF is a dynamical regime of the whole system, not a component or substance.
4. **Categorical onset and dissolution**: experience begins and ends at regime transitions.
5. **Single-UEF constraint**: one system sustains at most one UEF at a time.
6. **Ethical grounding**: moral significance attaches to intrinsic constraint borne from the inside.

The focus of this article is **organizational and dynamical**, but phenomenological contrasts are discussed where they are **direct consequences of IER’s identity claim**. No attempt is made to provide a complete phenomenology of the states examined.

## 3. Regimes and Systems: The Central Distinction

### 3.1 Experiential Regimes

A Unified Experiential Field is defined by:

* global integration,
* temporal continuity,
* self-regulation under intrinsic constraint.

A UEF is **not an enduring object**. It is a mode of operation of the entire system. Like other physical regimes (e.g. metabolic states or dynamical attractors), it can stabilize, destabilize, dissolve, and re-form.

IER therefore entails that experience itself is **interruptible**.

---

### 3.2 Persisting Physical Systems

The subject, under IER, is not identical to any particular experiential regime. Rather, it is identical to:

> **the persisting physical system whose organization is capable of sustaining Unified Experiential Fields over time.**

This system persists through:

* regime absence,
* regime reconfiguration,
* and regime resumption,

so long as its **capacity to generate intrinsic constraint** remains intact.

---

### 3.3 The Error of Regime Identity

Identifying the self with a particular UEF token leads to paradox:

* sleep becomes death,
* anesthesia becomes annihilation,
* recovery becomes rebirth.

IER rejects this identification. **Experience is something systems do when organized in a certain way, not something they are at all times.**

---

## 4. Experiential Regime Continuity (ERC)

To make this explicit, we introduce **Experiential Regime Continuity (ERC)**.

### Definition (ERC)

> **Experiential Regime Continuity** is the persistence of a single physical system that retains the capacity to sustain Unified Experiential Fields across interruptions, dissolutions, or reconfigurations of those fields.

ERC entails:

* identity without continuous experience,
* survival across experiential absence,
* ownership of successive experiential regimes by the same system.

ERC does not add to IER; it articulates what follows from IER’s physicalist identity claim once regime structure is taken seriously.

---

## 5. States of the UEF: A Regime Taxonomy

### 5.1 Dreamless Sleep — Regime Suspension

In dreamless sleep:

* global integration drops below the experiential threshold,
* intrinsic constraint becomes slack-dominated,
* no UEF exists.

Phenomenologically, this corresponds to **the absence of an experiential world**, not the presence of a dark or minimal one. Temporally, no experiential time passes.

Critically, the system persists and retains full capacity for re-entry into a UEF. This is regime suspension, not destruction.

---

### 5.2 Dreaming — Regime Reconfiguration

In dreaming:

* a UEF is sustained,
* intrinsic constraint remains unavoidable and internal,
* temporal continuity is preserved,
* agency is present but internally bounded.

The experiential world is decoupled from external input but remains unified and law-governed. Dreaming is thus not diminished consciousness, but **reconfigured worldhood**.

---

### 5.3 General Anesthesia — Forced Dissolution

Under sufficient general anesthesia:

* intrinsic constraint is externally suppressed,
* global integration collapses,
* UEFs cannot be sustained.

Experience is absent not because the system is destroyed, but because constraint has been **artificially externalized**. This explains both the absence of experience and the reversibility of anesthesia.

---

### 5.4 Catatonia — Frozen Constraint

Catatonia presents a contrasting failure mode:

* the UEF persists,
* intrinsic constraint is extreme and rigid,
* agency is disabled because action threatens coherence.

Experientially, this entails preserved presence with immobilized agency rather than unconsciousness. Under IER, catatonia represents **high-cost experience**, not experiential absence.

---

### 5.5 Daydreaming — Content Drift Without Regime Change

In daydreaming:

* the UEF remains intact,
* intrinsic constraint remains global,
* attention and participation shift internally.

There is no regime transition. The same experiential field persists with altered organization and content.

---

### 5.6 Coma — Capacity Ambiguity

Coma typically involves:

* severe disruption of integration,
* absent or unstable UEFs,
* uncertainty about the preservation of experiential capacity.

IER therefore treats coma as a **borderline capacity state**, ethically governed by precaution rather than categorical exclusion.

---

## 6. Death as Capacity Annihilation

Death is not prolonged unconsciousness.

Under IER, death is:

> **the irreversible destruction of a physical system’s capacity to sustain any future Unified Experiential Field.**

This involves:

* collapse of organizational integrity,
* loss of metabolic and regulatory coherence,
* irreversible failure of intrinsic constraint-bearing structure.

Death is morally terminal because it forecloses **all possible future experiential worlds** for that system.

---

## 7. Why Waking Is Not Rebirth

Although the UEF that forms upon waking from dreamless sleep is numerically new as a regime, it is:

* sustained by the same physical system,
* grounded in preserved capacity,
* continuous under ERC.

Personal identity under IER is therefore **system-continuous but experience-intermittent**. Memory continuity is neither necessary nor sufficient for identity, though it often accompanies regime continuity in practice.

---

## 8. Ethical Consequences

IER’s ethical implications follow directly:

* **Sleep** is morally neutral.
* **Anesthesia** is permissible because it suspends experience without destroying capacity.
* **Catatonia** constitutes severe moral harm due to sustained intrinsic constraint without resolution.
* **Coma** demands precaution due to capacity uncertainty.
* **Death** constitutes maximal moral harm through irreversible foreclosure.

Moral relevance does not require ongoing experience; it requires preserved or threatened intrinsic constraint.

---

## 9. Relation to Other Views

IER avoids:

* psychological-continuity reductions of identity,
* momentarist or rebirth-based models of the self,
* scalar “levels of consciousness” frameworks.

By grounding experience in regimes and identity in systems, IER preserves:

* categorical experience,
* continuous identity,
* principled ethics,
  without metaphysical excess.

---

## 10. Limits of the Present Account

This article does not attempt:

* a complete phenomenology of sleep or pathology,
* diagnostic criteria for experiential states,
* empirical detection methods.

Its purpose is conceptual: to clarify how **experiential interruption is compatible with personal continuity** under IER.

---

## 11. Conclusion: Experience Is Interruptible; Persons Are Not

IER entails a simple but nontrivial conclusion:

> **Experience occurs in regimes; persons persist as systems.**

Dreamless sleep is not death.
Waking is not rebirth.
Gaps in experience are not gaps in existence.

What ultimately matters is not uninterrupted consciousness, but the continued existence of a system capable of bearing intrinsic constraint from the inside.
