## **Forgetting as Loss of Experiential Re-entry**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.9.x)**
*Explanatory Article — Non-Normative (Tier 2)*

---

## **Status and Scope**

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no new ontological primitives**
* establishes **no criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics**
* does **not** define when experience exists
* does **not** treat forgetting as damage, harm, or loss of standing
* does **not** assign epistemic or moral authority to recall
* does **not** treat forgetting as erasure, decay, or deletion

All binding authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md
IER-theory.md
IER-dynamics.md
IER-math.md
IER-canon.md
```

If any interpretation here conflicts with those documents, the conflict is void.

This document explains **forgetting** under Informational Experiential Realism (IER) as a **failure of episodic experiential re-entry**, not as loss of stored content or historical structure.

---

## **Prerequisite Articles**

This document presupposes the structural account developed in:

* `IER-memory.md` — Episodic memory as experiential re-entry
* `IER-sedimentation.md` — Structural history without storage
* `IER-hysteresis.md` — Path-dependent constraint deformation
* `IER-participation.md` — Participation modulation within a UEF
* `IER-attractors.md` — Attractor geometry in experiential organization

These mechanisms are not re-derived here.

## **0. Orientation: Forgetting and Structural History**

Under Informational Experiential Realism, **history does not disappear**.

Past traversal irreversibly reshapes future viability through sedimentation and hysteresis, regardless of whether past events ever appear in experience.

**Forgetting** concerns something narrower:

> the inability of a Unified Experiential Field to *re-enter* a previously viable experiential organization as lived past.

Forgetting does **not** undo history.
It alters only whether history can be *experienced* again.

---

## **1. Forgetting Is Not Loss**

Under IER, there is:

* nothing stored
* nothing encoded
* nothing retained as content

Accordingly, forgetting cannot be loss, decay, erasure, or deletion.

When something is forgotten:

* no structure is removed
* no history is undone
* no past experience is destroyed

What fails is **present participation**, not past existence.

---

## **2. Forgetting Presupposes Memory (and Memory Presupposes Experience)**

Forgetting is not the absence of experience.

Under IER:

* experience exists **iff** a Unified Experiential Field (UEF) exists
* episodic memory occurs only *within* an already-existing UEF
* forgetting is a **modulation of experiential participation**, not a threat to experience itself

A system cannot forget unless it is capable of episodic memory.
A system can fully experience while forgetting continuously.

This blocks the inference that forgetting threatens subjecthood, continuity, or standing.

---

## **3. What Forgetting Is Under IER**

### **3.1 Forgetting as Failure of Episodic Re-entry**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

> **Forgetting is the inability of a Unified Experiential Field to coherently re-enter a previously viable experiential organization under current intrinsic constraint.**

Nothing is removed.
Nothing is erased.
Nothing is inaccessible because it is “gone.”

The system simply cannot, *now*, organize globally under that historical deformation without destabilizing coherence.

This is a **present-tense structural fact**, not a historical change.

---

### **3.2 Forgetting Is Not Non-Influence**

A forgotten history may still:

* bias affect
* shape salience
* constrain choice
* influence action

without ever appearing as recollection.

Forgetting therefore means **non-experiential participation**, not absence of effect.

---

## **4. Why Some Things Are Forgotten First**

Forgetting is not uniform.
IER explains this through **attractor geometry**, not diagnostics or damage.

---

### **4.1 Narrow Attractors Fail Early**

Examples include:

* proper names
* arbitrary labels
* exact factual bindings
* precise symbolic associations

These require:

* narrow basins of attraction
* high constraint precision
* sharp exclusion of nearby alternatives

As constraint becomes noisier, costlier, or more weakly enforced, these attractors become unre-enterable.

The system does not “lose” the name.
It refuses to force a brittle collapse.

---

### **4.2 Broad Trajectories Persist**

Examples include:

* skills
* habits
* routines
* narrative structures
* action schemas

These are satisfied by **lawful continuity**, not exact identity.

They tolerate:

* drift
* approximation
* partial recruitment

They therefore persist long after precision-based recall fails.

This explains why people forget *labels* before *actions*, and *names* before *stories*.

---

## **5. Circumlocution Is Not Failure**

When someone says:

> “that thing”
> “the one you use for…”
> “you know, the thing over there”

this is not a breakdown.

It is a **strategic relaxation of constraint**.

Instead of forcing a narrow attractor, the system:

* widens the basin
* offloads specificity to context or others
* preserves global coherence

Under IER, this is **regime-preserving behavior**, not compensation for deficit.

---

## **6. Forgetting Without Experiential Harm**

### **6.1 No Loss of Standing**

Experiential standing under IER is **categorical**.

It does not scale with:

* memory fidelity
* recall availability
* narrative continuity

A subject who forgets remains fully a subject.

---

### **6.2 Forgetting Is Not Damage**

Forgetting becomes morally or clinically relevant **only if** it reflects:

* irreversible collapse of intrinsic constraint capacity, or
* dissolution of the Unified Experiential Field itself

Ordinary forgetting does neither.

It is **organizational adjustment**, not harm.

---

## **7. Load, Fatigue, and Aging**

### **7.1 Fatigue and Stress**

Temporary forgetting often reflects:

* participation overload
* narrowed viable futures
* protective simplification

These states are **reversible** and **regime-preserving**.

The system prioritizes coherence over precision.

---

### **7.2 Aging as Precision Relaxation**

Across aging:

* constraint sharpness decreases
* informational slack increases
* exact bindings become expensive

The system responds by favoring:

* broader attractors
* functional descriptions
* narrative continuity

Experience and identity are preserved while exactness is abandoned.

---

## **8. Forgetting, Suppression, and Dissolution (Disambiguation)**

To preserve scope discipline, these must be sharply distinguished:

| Phenomenon  | Structural Status                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Forgetting  | Failure of episodic re-entry          |
| Suppression | Active exclusion under constraint     |
| Repression  | Long-horizon avoidance of recruitment |
| Dissolution | Collapse of experiential regime       |

Only dissolution threatens experience itself.

---

## **9. Why Forgetting Is Often Beneficial**

Forgetting:

* reduces constraint load
* prevents salience saturation
* preserves global coherence
* enables adaptation

A system that never forgot would be unstable, overloaded, and brittle.

Under IER, forgetting is often a **success condition**, not a defect.

---

## **10. What This Document Does *Not* Do**

This document does **not**:

* diagnose memory disorders
* distinguish healthy from pathological forgetting
* explain neural mechanisms
* treat recall as virtue
* equate memory with intelligence
* provide therapeutic or engineering guidance

Such moves exceed scope and violate canon discipline.

---

## **11. Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* forgetting is **loss of episodic re-entry**, not loss of history
* nothing is erased
* constraint deformation persists
* narrow attractors fail first
* broader trajectories preserve coherence
* subjecthood and standing remain intact
* forgetting is often adaptive

> **Forgetting is not the past disappearing.**
> **It is the present refusing to reorganize that way anymore.**

---

### **Intermission — Structural Fact**

What cannot be coherently re-entered has not vanished.
It has simply ceased to be a viable way for the system to be *now*.
