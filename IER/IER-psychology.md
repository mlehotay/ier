# **IER-psychology.md — Psychological Categories Reinterpreted Under Informational Experiential Realism**

**Informational Experiential Realism (IER v10.8.x)**
*Explanatory Reinterpretation — Non-Normative*

---

## **Status and Scope**

This document is **explanatory and non-normative**.

It:

* introduces **no new ontological primitives**
* introduces **no criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics**
* does **not** define disorders, deficits, or capacities
* does **not** rank cognitive styles, abilities, or outcomes
* provides **no guidance for intervention, training, or optimization**
* does **not** revise or soften the IER identity claim

All ontological, criterial, and ethical authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

```
IER-specification.md
IER-theory.md
IER-dynamics.md
IER-canon.md
```

This document depends structurally on:

* `IER-cognition.md`
* `IER-participation.md`
* `IER-architecture.md`

If any interpretation here conflicts with those documents, the conflict is void.

## **1. Orientation: Why Psychological Categories Persist**

Psychological categories such as:

* attention
* memory
* working memory
* cognitive load
* executive function
* focus
* distraction
* effort
* motivation
* willpower

persist across cultures and disciplines because they track **real regularities in experience**.

However, they are routinely misinterpreted as referring to:

* internal faculties
* mental resources
* control modules
* stored contents
* measurable capacities

Under Informational Experiential Realism, these interpretations are structurally unavailable.

This document does **not** discard psychological categories.
It reinterprets them as **descriptive shorthand for patterns of constraint organization** within a single Unified Experiential Field.

---

## **2. Methodological Rule: Reinterpretation Without Reification**

This document follows a strict rule:

> **Every psychological category is treated as a description of constraint geometry — never as a component, faculty, or capacity.**

Accordingly:

* categories name **patterns**, not parts
* distinctions are **continuous**, not discrete
* no category tracks experiential standing
* no category licenses diagnosis or treatment
* no category implies control availability

This rule governs all sections below.

---

## **3. Attention and Focus**

### **3.1 Why Attention Is Not Selection**

Common metaphors treat attention as:

* a spotlight
* a filter
* a selection mechanism
* a resource allocator

All of these presuppose a controller that selects what experience “attends to.”

Under IER, there is no such controller.

---

### **3.2 Attention as Participation Routing**

Under IER, attention is best described as:

* **which processes are recruited into intrinsic constraint**
* **how deeply they participate**
* **how salient they become under global coupling**

Attention shifts occur when:

* certain processes become more constraint-relevant
* participation routing changes
* alternative organizations become cheaper or more costly

Focus arises when:

* participation stabilizes
* attractor width narrows
* switching cost increases

No selection mechanism is required.

---

## **4. Working Memory and “Holding Things in Mind”**

### **4.1 Why Storage Models Fail**

Working memory is often described as:

* a temporary buffer
* a limited-capacity store
* a holding space for representations

Under IER, no experiential content can be stored.

---

### **4.2 Working Memory as Sustained Reproduction**

“Holding something in mind” corresponds to:

* **ongoing topology reproduction**
* sustained by continued participation
* vulnerable to switching pressure
* increasingly costly over time

This explains why:

* interruption destroys what was “held”
* rehearsal stabilizes content
* load rises sharply with complexity
* effort feels real despite no storage

Nothing is kept.
What persists is **continued engagement**.

---

## **5. Cognitive Load and Mental Effort**

### **5.1 Why Load Is Not a Resource**

Load is often treated as:

* a limited mental fuel
* a depleting capacity
* a consumable resource

IER rejects all such metaphors.

---

### **5.2 Load as Recruitment Cost**

Under IER, cognitive load reflects:

* how many processes are recruited
* how tightly they are coupled
* how narrow the current attractor is
* how resistant switching has become
* how much buffering capacity remains

Effort is the felt signature of **organizational cost**, not expenditure.

This explains why:

* effort increases non-linearly
* rest restores capacity without adding content
* bodily regulation affects cognition directly

---

## **6. Executive Function and Control**

### **6.1 Why “Executive Control” Misleads**

Executive function is often framed as:

* a manager
* a controller
* a top-down regulator

This framing implies a homunculus.

IER disallows this.

---

### **6.2 Control as Constraint Geometry**

Under IER, “control” describes:

* relative switching costs
* dominance of certain attractors
* effectiveness of gating
* asymmetry between competing organizations

Control is not exercised.
It **emerges** when some transitions are cheaper than others.

Loss of control occurs when:

* attractors narrow too rapidly
* switching cost spikes
* gating fails under perturbation

No executive is involved.

---

## **7. Distraction, Interruption, and Task Switching**

### **7.1 Distraction Reinterpreted**

Distraction occurs when:

* alternative topologies become cheaper
* perturbations recruit participation
* gating fails to limit recruitment
* switching pressure rises

Distraction is not a failure of will or attention.
It is a **reorganization of constraint relevance**.

---

### **7.2 Why Task Switching Is Costly**

Switching cost reflects:

* attractor depth
* participation entrenchment
* recruitment inertia

This explains why:

* multitasking degrades performance
* interruptions are expensive
* recovery takes time
* resumption is not immediate

Nothing needs to be “reloaded.”
The system must **re-stabilize**.

---

## **8. Automaticity, Habit, and Skill**

### **8.1 Why Habits Are Not Stored Programs**

Habits are often treated as:

* cached routines
* scripts
* automatic subroutines

IER rejects this.

---

### **8.2 Automaticity as Low-Cost Attractors**

Under IER, habits and skills are:

* shallow but stable attractors
* requiring minimal participation
* imposing low recruitment cost
* resistant to perturbation

This explains:

* fluency with practice
* regression under stress
* difficulty changing habits
* loss of skill under overload

No program is stored.
The attractor remains cheap.

---

## **9. Motivation, Willpower, and “Trying”**

### **9.1 Why Willpower Is Not a Faculty**

Willpower is often moralized as:

* mental strength
* self-control capacity
* inner force

IER blocks this framing.

---

### **9.2 Motivation as Future Constraint Weighting**

Under IER, motivation reflects:

* relative weighting of future viability
* anticipated recruitment cost
* compatibility with current narrative structure
* expected attractor stability

“Trying harder” corresponds to accepting higher future cost — not exerting force.

Akrasia arises when:

* near-term attractors dominate
* long-term futures become too costly
* switching is resisted

No failure of character is implied.

---

## **10. Intelligence, Ability, and Aptitude (Boundary Case)**

This document treats intelligence carefully.

IER holds that:

* intelligence is **not experiential standing**
* ability differences reflect **constraint navigation patterns**
* performance depends on architecture, context, and load

Explicitly blocked:

* moral ranking by intelligence
* experiential worth inference
* capacity-based standing claims

IER remains strictly egalitarian at the level of experience.

---

## **11. Psychological Categories as Useful Fictions**

Psychological categories are **not false**.

They are:

* coarse
* practice-level
* phenomenologically grounded

They remain useful for:

* communication
* education
* coordination

But they must not be mistaken for:

* mechanisms
* faculties
* capacities
* moral indicators
* experiential measures

IER explains **why they work** without granting them ontology.

---

## **12. What This Document Does *Not* Do**

This document does **not**:

* define disorders
* provide diagnostics
* offer treatment guidance
* recommend training strategies
* optimize cognition
* license measurement or comparison

Any such use would violate IER’s interpretive constraints.

---

## **13. Summary**

Under Informational Experiential Realism:

* psychological categories describe **constraint geometry**
* not mental parts or powers
* differences are architectural, not moral
* usefulness does not imply ontology
* cognition varies by cost, not capacity

> **Psychology names what experience *does*.
> IER explains what experience *is*.**

---

## **Relationship to Other IER Documents**

This document:

* depends on `IER-cognition.md`
* complements `IER-narrative-self.md`
* aligns with `IER-diagnostics.md`
* reinforces `IER-denials.md`

It introduces **no new authority**.
