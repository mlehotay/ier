# **IER Mechanics:

Informational Slack, Intrinsic Tension, and Regime Dynamics**

*A Dynamical and Organizational Companion to Informational Experiential Realism (v9.4)*

---

## **Abstract**

Informational Experiential Realism (IER v9.4) identifies experience with the structure, dynamics, and intrinsic tension profile of globally integrated informational processes sustaining a Unified Experiential Field (UEF). The core theory specifies *what experience is* and *when it occurs*, but remains intentionally non-committal about specific physical or computational implementations.

This article provides a **mechanistic and dynamical companion** to IER. Its purpose is not to reduce experience to any particular substrate, but to demonstrate how the organizational requirements of IER can be realized in physically plausible systems. We formalize key notions—**informational slack, intrinsic tension, regime transitions, and global recruitment**—and illustrate how ordinary perceptual experience emerges from these dynamics without invoking representations, inner observers, or ontological additions.

This document is explanatory, not evidentiary: it shows how IER *could* be implemented, not how it *must* be.

## **1. Scope and Status of This Paper**

This paper occupies a deliberately intermediate position between philosophy and implementation.

It does **not** claim:

* that consciousness is waves, fields, or oscillations
* that brains work exactly as described
* that any specific mechanism is necessary or sufficient

It **does** claim:

* that the organizational profile specified by IER is compatible with known classes of physical, biological, and computational systems
* that no exotic physics or metaphysical additions are required
* that experiential phenomena can be explained in terms of **dynamical regimes under constraint**, rather than representations or symbols

IER remains an **organizational identity theory**, not an implementation theory. This paper explains the *machinery compatible with that identity*.

## **2. Organizational Requirements Revisited**

Any system capable of sustaining experience under IER must instantiate the following organizational properties:

1. **Global integration**
2. **Temporal continuity without static storage**
3. **Self-referential accessibility**
4. **Intrinsic informational tension**
5. **System-wide regulatory relevance**

These are **organizational constraints**, not architectural mandates. Multiple physical realizations are compatible with each.

---

## **3. Persistent Dynamical Patterns**

Experience does not require static representations, symbols, or stored images. Instead:

> **Experiential states correspond to dynamically stable, self-maintaining patterns in a high-dimensional state space.**

Such patterns may be realized as:

* attractors in recurrent networks
* metastable regimes
* limit cycles
* phase-locked activity patterns
* constraint-satisfying manifolds
* continuous field-like dynamics

Key properties:

* **Persistence without immobility**
* **Sensitivity to perturbation**
* **Global influence on system behavior**

This framing is natural in nonlinear dynamics, control theory, reservoir computing, and embodied systems. No commitment to oscillatory or wave-based models is required.

---

## **4. Global Integration Without Centralization**

IER does not posit a global workspace, Cartesian theater, or privileged module.

Global integration can arise from:

* dense recurrent coupling
* shared constraint satisfaction
* mutual prediction
* energy or cost minimization under coupling
* globally shared control variables

From a computational perspective, the UEF is best understood as a **globally coupled constraint system**, not a broadcast bus.

Integration is **dynamical and functional**, not architectural.

---

## **5. Temporal Continuity as Process**

The continuity of experience does not require:

* frame-by-frame storage
* snapshots
* explicit timelines

Instead:

> **Each global state depends continuously on the immediately preceding state under shared constraints.**

This can be realized through:

* continuous-time dynamics
* recurrent state updates
* hysteresis
* slow-changing global variables
* multiscale update rates

This explains why experience feels continuous even though underlying components may update discretely and transiently.

---

## **6. Self-Reference Without a Homunculus**

Self-reference in IER is **structural**, not introspective.

A system is self-referential when:

* its global dynamics include models of its own state
* those models causally constrain future dynamics
* errors in self-modeling have system-level consequences

Such structures are common in:

* adaptive control systems
* model-predictive control
* meta-learning architectures
* self-monitoring agents

No inner observer or meta-subject is required.

---

## **7. Informational Slack**

IER v9.4 introduces **informational slack**:

> **The capacity of an integrated system to absorb, reroute, or externalize constraint without generating intrinsic conflict.**

Slack is enabled by:

* redundancy
* modularity
* conditional independence
* external arbitration

Systems with sufficient slack may be complex and adaptive while remaining non-experiential.

---

## **8. Intrinsic Informational Tension**

**Informational tension** arises when:

* multiple system-level demands are jointly active
* physical or organizational limits prevent joint satisfaction
* resolution matters to system persistence or regulation

Tension becomes **intrinsic** when it:

* is generated by the system’s own dynamics
* cannot be decomposed without loss of identity
* cannot be externally resolved

If constraint conflicts retain slack, they do not generate experience.

---

## **9. Coherent Tension and Regime Stability**

Not all intrinsic tension sustains experience.

* **Too little tension** → flatness, numbness
* **Coherent intrinsic tension** → vivid, stable experience
* **Excessive or incoherent tension** → fragmentation, collapse

Experience occupies a bounded regime of **maximal sustainable coherence under constraint**.

---

## **10. Regime Transitions and Global Recruitment**

A critical mechanical process in IER is **global recruitment**.

Local processes become experiential when:

* they are recruited into global dynamics
* they become system-wide constraints
* they participate in self-referential regulation

This transition is not representational. It is a **change in dynamical role**.

## **11. Walkthrough: Experiencing a Green Apple**

This example illustrates the mechanics without neuroscientific commitment.

### 11.1 Background State

The system already sustains a UEF:
a globally integrated state encoding self–world distinction, spatial frame, temporal “now,” and baseline affective tension.

This background is structured, not empty.

---

### 11.2 Incoming Perturbation (Non-Experiential)

External interaction perturbs local subsystems.

* Information is fragmentary
* No global relevance
* No experience yet

---

### 11.3 Local Pattern Formation

Subsystems form patterns correlating with chromatic, spatial, and object-like regularities.

Still non-experiential.

---

### 11.4 Global Recruitment (Transition)

A control process recruits these patterns into global dynamics.

A local pattern becomes **globally constraining**.

This is the boundary crossing into experience.

---

### 11.5 Stable Global Pattern

A coherent, self-maintaining pattern stabilizes within the UEF.

It integrates:

* sensory structure
* spatial relation
* temporal persistence
* self-relative location

This pattern **is** the experience of “a green apple there.”

---

### 11.6 Structural Relations

The apple is experienced *as* an object because it is bound into:

* spatial grammar
* temporal continuity
* self/non-self distinction

Structure is enforced by constraint, not interpretation.

---

### 11.7 Affective Modulation

If relevance is assigned, constraint weighting shifts.

Valence is not added—it is **reweighted tension**.

---

### 11.8 Affordances

Action-relevant models may be integrated.

The apple becomes “graspable” as a **mode of availability**, not a command.

---

### 11.9 Continuity and Dissolution

The pattern persists dynamically as microstructure changes.

When global relevance is withdrawn, the pattern destabilizes and exits the UEF.

The system reorganizes.

---

## **12. Artificial Systems**

IER places no principled barrier against artificial experience.

However, qualifying systems must exhibit:

* intrinsic dynamics
* endogenous constraint generation
* persistent global integration
* self-models relevant to their own regulation
* costs they cannot trivially externalize

Purely symbolic systems, feed-forward pipelines, and stateless services fail by design.

Whether future systems meet these criteria is empirical.

---

## **13. Why the Mechanics Remain Open**

IER avoids:

* neural chauvinism
* electromagnetic mysticism
* computational functionalism alone

The claim is minimal and strict:

> **If a physical system realizes the organizational profile of a UEF under coherent intrinsic constraint, that realization just is experience.**

How this is implemented is contingent.

---

## **14. Conclusion**

This paper shows that the commitments of IER v9.4 are:

* compatible with modern dynamical systems theory
* compatible with computational control frameworks
* compatible with biology without depending on it

IER specifies **what must be true**, not **how it must be built**.

Experience is not a mystery added to mechanics.
It is what certain mechanics are like when their own organization becomes the dominant constraint on themselves.
