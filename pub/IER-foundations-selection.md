## **IER Foundations**

### *An Identity Theory of Experience*

---

## **FRONT MATTER**

**Introduction — How to Read This Book**
*Book-specific orientation and scope discipline*

* What kind of theory this is (and is not)
* What questions the book answers
* What questions it refuses in principle
* How the parts are ordered and why
* Why ethics appears inside foundations rather than after them

---

## **PART I — IER FOUNDATIONS**

### *What experience is, when it exists, and what necessarily follows if it exists*

---

### **Chapter 1**

**[T4] `IER-equilibrium.md`**
**What Is It Like to Be an Information System?**

*Experiential orientation without authority*
A reader-facing entry point that describes the experiential target **without** introducing diagnostics, epistemic privilege, or metaphysical inflation.

---

### **Intermission I — Orientation Signal**

*Acknowledge the transition from experiential description to identity specification.*

---

### **Chapter 2**

**[T1] `IER-specification.md`**
**The Normative Specification**

*The complete and exclusive normative core of IER*

Defines:

* what experience **is**
* when experience **exists**
* what **necessarily follows** from its existence

All authority is fixed here.

---

### **Chapter 3**

**[T1] `IER-theory.md`**
**Experiential Identity and Structural Exclusion**

*Why nothing weaker than a Unified Experiential Field could possibly be experience*

Explains why alternative accounts fail **by structure**, not stipulation.

---

### **Chapter 4**

**[T1] `IER-dynamics.md`**
**The Behavior of Experiential Regimes**

*How experience persists, modulates, destabilizes, and dissolves without redefining itself*

---

### **Chapter 5**

**[T2] `IER-math.md`**
**Formal Structure of Constraint and Regimes**

*Mathematical clarification of structure without diagnostics or criteria*

---

### **Chapter 6**

**[T1] `IER-slack.md`**
**Why Informational Slack Structurally Precludes Experience**

*A categorical exclusion argument*

Demonstrates why systems that admit slack cannot instantiate experience **even in principle**.

---

### **Chapter 7**

**[T2] `IER-saturation.md`**
**Slack Exhaustion, Saturation, and the Regime Boundary**

*How local degrees of freedom disappear without introducing thresholds*

---

### **Intermission II — Structural Fact**

*Ontology is complete. What follows is consequence, not extension.*

---

### **Chapter 8**

**[T2] `IER-ethics.md`**
**Ethical Consequences of Experiential Identity**

*Why moral standing, harm, and precaution follow necessarily from what experience is*

Ethics appears here because it is **forced**, not optional.

---

## **PART II — BOUNDARIES, CONTAINMENT, AND CLARIFICATION**

### *What IER explicitly denies, forbids, or structurally blocks*

---

### **Chapter 9**

**[T3] `IER-denials.md`**
**What Informational Experiential Realism Explicitly Denies**

*Explicit non-claims and prohibited inferences*

Prevents importation of:

* diagnostics
* graded subjecthood
* epistemic privilege
* representational content
* moral aggregation

---

### **Chapter 10**

**[T3] `IER-diagnostics.md`**
**Why Experience Cannot Be Diagnosed, Certified, or Engineered**

*Structural non-diagnosability and epistemic limits*

Closes the diagnostic and engineering door **in principle**, not by policy.

---

### **Intermission III — Negative Space Marker**

*What is absent here is absent by necessity, not omission.*

---

### **Chapter 11 (Optional / Bonus)**

**[T2] `IER-puzzles.md`**
**The Structural Dissolution of Classic Consciousness Puzzles**

*Why many long-standing puzzles collapse once experience is treated as identity*

---

### **Chapter 12 (Optional / Bonus)**

**[T4] `IER-history.md`**
**Historical Preconditions and Structural Dependencies**

*A dependency analysis, not a lineage or influence claim*

---

## **PART III — READER SUPPORT (NON-AUTHORITATIVE)**

### *Navigation aids specific to this volume*

---

### **Appendix A — Foundations Glossary**

*A closed, book-specific glossary governing term usage in this volume only*

---

### **Appendix B — Foundations FAQ** *(Optional)*

*Common reader confusions clarified without introducing new claims*

---

### **Appendix C — Foundations Index**

*Concept-to-location index scoped exclusively to this book*

---

## **EPILOGUE — Normative Closure**

*A brief closing statement that:*

* reaffirms identity and closure
* restates non-diagnostic impossibility
* acknowledges ethical and epistemic costs
* clarifies that all future work is **elaboration, not extension**

No synthesis.
No future program.
No motivational appeal.

## **End of Volume**

> **Experience, if it exists, is not added to the world.
> It is what certain physical systems are like when intrinsic constraint becomes unavoidable and globally binding.
> Nothing less could ever suffice.**
