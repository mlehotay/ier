# IER Foundations Book — Decisions and Guidance (Summary)

## 1. Reader Stratification

We identified three distinct reader types, each served by a different artifact:

### **Anchor Readers**

* Target artifact: **Full IER corpus book** (technical monograph).
* Characteristics:

  * Comfortable with outline-dense, constraint-first material.
  * Seek formal clarity, exact claims, and citeable reference.
* Status:

  * This book is the **anchor artifact** in deployment terms.
  * High rigor, low pedagogy is appropriate and intentional.

### **Gateway Readers**

* Target artifact: **IER Foundations book** (shorter, prose, non-authoritative).
* Characteristics:

  * Serious but not yet invested.
  * Need motivation, examples, repetition in multiple registers.
  * Could become anchor readers.
* Core need:

  * Understanding *why* the theory is structured as it is, not just *what* it says.

### **Casual Readers**

* Not directly targeted.
* Exposure only via:

  * talks
  * interviews
  * secondary commentary
  * possibly skimming the preprint paper
* Attempting to directly serve this group would harm rigor and clarity for the other two.

There is also an **implicit fourth group**:

* **Translators** (people who explain IER to others).
* The foundations book will strongly shape how IER is represented by them.

## 2. Diagnosis: Why “Prose Part I Only” Fails

A foundations book that is *only* Part I rewritten in prose would be:

* cognitively demanding
* psychologically unrewarding
* “all reader demands, no payoff”

Part I is constraint-establishing by design and withholds applications and intuitions.
This is correct for anchor readers but insufficient for gateway readers.

Therefore, **pure foundations is structurally incomplete as a book**, even if well written.

## 3. Key Design Constraint: No Authority Creep

Simply including Tier 2 or Tier 4 articles as chapters is **not acceptable**, because it would:

* blur authority boundaries
* invert dependency structure
* make it appear that conclusions are part of the foundations
* undermine the deployment discipline of IER

The foundations book must remain:

* explicitly **non-authoritative**
* clearly **downstream** of the corpus book
* an **interface**, not a fork or reorganization

---

## 4. Solution: Exemplars, Not Chapters

To provide reader reward without authority confusion:

* Use **illustrative exemplars**, not full articles.
* Draw selectively from Tier 2 / Tier 4 material.
* Present them as:

  * short
  * clearly labeled
  * non-derivational
  * consequence-oriented

Purpose:

* Give “proof of life”
* Show what kind of work the constraints do
* Provide closure signals

Heuristic:

> If a reader could cite it *instead of* the main corpus book, it does not belong.

## 5. Recommended High-Level Structure of the Foundations Book

### **Front Matter (Calibration)**

* Purpose and status of the book (explicitly non-authoritative).
* Relationship to:

  * the IER corpus book
  * the preprint paper
* “How to read this book”:

  * explains constraint-first style
  * sets expectations
  * clarifies role of examples vs arguments

---

### **Core Foundations**

* One chapter per **each of the 7 core articles**.
* Written in continuous prose.
* Emphasis on:

  * motivation
  * problem pressure
  * why alternatives fail
* No formal dependency enforcement in prose, but ordering preserved.
* Each chapter ends with:

  * “what this enables later”
  * pointer to the canonical article

---

### **Interleaved Payoff Sections**

* Occur after every 1–2 foundations chapters.
* Length: ~3–6 pages.
* Content:

  * illustrative consequences
  * intuitive downstream implications
  * disambiguations and clarifications
* Explicitly labeled as:

  * downstream
  * non-authoritative
  * non-derivational

These sections are what make the book *feel good* to read.

---

### **Orientation and Closure**

Essential for reader satisfaction.

Include:

* What IER explicitly does **not** try to do.
* Limits, non-goals, common misreadings.
* Conceptual overview of the full corpus:

  * Parts I–III
  * what kinds of questions each tier answers
* “Where to go next” reading guidance.

This gives a sense of completion without claiming completeness.

---

## 6. Specific Component Decisions

### **Glossary**

* Strongly recommended.
* Tailored to the foundations book.
* Includes conceptual glosses, not just definitions.
* Explicitly warns when stricter canonical definitions exist elsewhere.

---

### **IER-intro.md**

* Should **not** be included verbatim.
* Its *function* should be used:

  * orientation language
  * corpus mapping
* Best folded into:

  * front calibration
  * or closing orientation section

---

### **Optional Appendices**

Lightweight, optional, but useful:

* Common confusions
* Why the outline format exists
* Rigor vs accessibility

These primarily help translators and reviewers.

---

## 7. Deployment Consistency

The foundations book:

* comes **after** the corpus book
* introduces **no new commitments**
* carries **no authority**
* serves as an explanatory interface

This is fully consistent with existing IER deployment principles and does **not** require changing them.

---

## 8. Meta-Decision: Project Context

This discussion does **not** belong in `IER-book`.

* `IER-book` = assembly and publishing infrastructure
* This discussion = reader modeling, interface design, pedagogical strategy

Conclusion:

* This conversation should continue in the **main IER project context** (or a dedicated exposition/interface thread), not in IER-book.

---

## Bottom Line

* Reader stratification is correct and stable.
* A foundations book is justified and strategically sound.
* It must go beyond Part I prose **without importing authority**.
* Exemplars provide payoff without hierarchy collapse.
* Glossary and orientation are essential.
* This is an interface-layer design problem, not a book-assembly problem.
