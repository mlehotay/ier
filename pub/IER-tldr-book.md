# IER TLDR Book

**Artifact Specification (Expository Interface Publication)**

---

## 1. Artifact Identity

**Title:** *Informational Experiential Realism (IER) — TLDR Book*
**Artifact class:** Interface publication
**Epistemic role:** Expository, reader-oriented interface to the IER corpus
**Authority:** Non-authoritative; defers to the IER Corpus Book for ordering, pagination, and reference

The IER TLDR Book is an **interpretive interface artifact** whose purpose is to make the structure, concepts, and motivations of IER intelligible without serving as a reference anchor.

It is not a substitute for the Corpus Book and must never be treated as a citeable authority.

---

## 2. Relationship to the Corpus Book

The TLDR Book is explicitly **downstream of** and **subordinate to** the IER Corpus Book.

* All conceptual claims derive from the corpus.
* Any overlap with canonical text is illustrative, not authoritative.
* Pagination, ordering, and reference authority reside exclusively in the Corpus Book.

The TLDR Book exists to **explain**, not to define.

---

## 3. Physical Format

### 3.1 Trim Size

* **Trim size:** **7 × 9 inches**

This trim size is fixed for all editions of the TLDR Book.

### 3.2 Column Model

* **Default page layout:** **Single column**

The single-column layout supports narrative flow, explanation, and extended prose.

Two-column layouts are not permitted in the TLDR Book.

---

## 4. Design Intent

The TLDR Book is designed as a **reader-forward, explanatory monograph** that emphasizes clarity, continuity, and conceptual accessibility.

### 4.1 Reading Contract

* Supports linear, cover-to-cover reading
* Encourages conceptual orientation and synthesis
* Assumes no prior exposure to the corpus ordering

The TLDR Book may reorder, summarize, or group ideas for explanatory purposes.

---

## 5. Tone, Density, and Style

* **Tone:** Explanatory, precise, but conversational relative to the Corpus Book
* **Information density:** Moderate
* **Pacing:** Intentionally relaxed compared to the anchor artifact
* **Paragraph structure:** Shorter paragraphs permitted
* **Headings:** Conceptual and pedagogical rather than purely structural

The design should resemble a **technical monograph or extended essay**, not a handbook.

---

## 6. Content Constraints

The TLDR Book **may**:

* Summarize or restate concepts from the corpus
* Use illustrative examples and analogies
* Reorganize material to improve comprehension
* Quote short passages from the corpus for illustration

The TLDR Book **must not**:

* Introduce new theoretical claims
* Modify or reinterpret definitions in ways that diverge from the corpus
* Establish independent terminology
* Present itself as a definitive or complete reference

---

## 7. Structural Characteristics

* Structure is determined by explanatory coherence, not canonical ordering
* Chapters may synthesize multiple corpus sections
* Cross-references to the Corpus Book are encouraged where precision is required

The TLDR Book may include:

* Introductory framing
* Transitional material
* Conceptual summaries
* Forward references to deeper material in the corpus

---

## 8. Explicit Non-Goals

The TLDR Book must **not**:

* Serve as a citation or reference standard
* Replace the Corpus Book for technical work
* Act as a verbatim reproduction of canonical text
* Conflate explanation with authority

It is an **interface**, not an anchor.

---

## 9. Relationship to Other IER Publications

* The **Corpus Book** is the sole anchor publication.
* The **Foundations Compilation** is a verbatim subset interface with minimal framing.
* Preprints and academic articles serve scholarly dissemination roles.

The TLDR Book occupies the space between **first contact** and **deep reference**, but claims no authority of its own.

---

## 10. Stability and Change Control

Any change to:

* trim size,
* column policy,
* or the epistemic role of the TLDR Book

requires a corresponding update to IER publishing governance documents and a versioned revision of this specification.
