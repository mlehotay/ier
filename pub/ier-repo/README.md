# Informational Experiential Realism (IER)

This repository hosts **public-facing artifacts** of **Informational Experiential Realism (IER)**, a theory of experience defined by a determinate identity claim, its structural exclusions, and its ethical consequences.

This is a **curated export repository**, not the primary development environment.

---

## Scope and Authority

Contents here are derived from **tagged repository states** governed by explicit versioning and immutability rules.

This repository:

* does **not** define canonical authority
* does **not** establish corpus completeness
* does **not** confer authority by venue or distribution

Authoritative control resides upstream and is fixed by global IER versions and immutable git tags.

---

## Versions and Releases

IER uses a single global version namespace (e.g. `v10.9.0`).

Releases are anchored to git tags, including:

* `ier-seed` — one-time existence anchor
* `ier-vX.Y.Z` — core IER versions

GitHub Releases, if present, are derivative.

## Contributions

Pull requests may improve presentation or tooling but must not modify identity claims, exclusions, or versioning. Canonical changes occur upstream.
