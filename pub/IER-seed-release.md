# **IER Seed Release**

**Artifact Specification (Existence-Anchoring Publication)**

---

## **1. Artifact Identity**

**Title:** *Informational Experiential Realism (IER) — Seed Release*
**Artifact class:** Pre-deployment existence anchor
**Epistemic role:** Identity fixation and exclusion anchoring
**Authority:** Limited; fixes identity and exclusions only
**Formats:** Public repository + frozen publication (e.g. print / ebook)

The IER Seed Release is a **minimal, existence-anchoring publication** that establishes the public reality of Informational Experiential Realism as a determinate identity theory of experience.

It is intentionally **incomplete**, **non-pedagogical**, and **non-exhaustive**.

---

## **2. Purpose and Justification**

The Seed Release exists to ensure that it is publicly and verifiably true that:

> *A theory called Informational Experiential Realism existed, at a determinate time, asserting a specific identity claim about experience, enforcing specific structural exclusions, and acknowledging specific ethical consequences.*

This artifact exists to prevent:

* total non-publication due to delay or interruption
* loss of conceptual priority through non-appearance
* retroactive claims that the theory never existed in a fixed form
* dependence on future completion for present reality

The Seed Release is **not** intended to be read as a book, taught as an introduction, or cited as a reference work.

---

## **3. Relationship to Other IER Artifacts**

### **3.1 Relation to the IER Corpus Book**

The Seed Release is **not** the IER Corpus Book.

It:

* establishes no pagination authority
* establishes no canonical ordering
* does not enumerate the full corpus
* does not imply corpus completeness

The IER Corpus Book, when released, is the **sole authoritative reference artifact** and supersedes the Seed Release for all citation, ordering, and completeness purposes.

---

### **3.2 Relation to the Foundations Book**

The Seed Release is **not** an interface publication.

Unlike the Foundations Book, it:

* is not a verbatim extraction of a corpus subset
* is not intended for linear reading
* is not scoped to “foundational material” as a pedagogical category

The Foundations Book presupposes the existence of the corpus.
The Seed Release presupposes only the existence of the identity claim.

---

### **3.3 Relation to Interface and Expository Artifacts**

The Seed Release is **not**:

* an explanatory interface
* an onboarding artifact
* a pedagogical rewrite
* a summary or précis

Later interface artifacts must defer to the **Corpus Book**, not to the Seed Release.

---

## **4. Authority Scope**

The Seed Release fixes **only** the following:

1. The **identity claim** of IER
2. The **structural exclusions** that follow from that claim
3. The **ethical consequences** that are explicitly forced by identity
4. The fact that these commitments were asserted together as a single theory

It does **not** fix:

* final wording beyond the included documents
* stylistic or organizational conventions
* the scope or boundaries of the eventual corpus
* the completeness of foundational coverage

---

## **5. Immutability and Change Discipline**

Once published, the Seed Release is **substantively immutable** in the following sense:

* the identity claim must not be silently revised
* exclusions must not be weakened or withdrawn
* ethical consequences must not be disavowed

Permitted changes are limited to:

* typographical correction
* formatting correction
* clarification that does not alter substance

Any substantive alteration requires:

* a new Seed Release version, or
* incorporation into a later Corpus Book edition

---

## **6. Permitted Contents**

The Seed Release may include **only identity-critical and exclusion-critical documents**.

For **Seed Release v0.1**, the permitted set is:

* `IER-specification.md`
* `IER-theory.md`
* `IER-slack.md`
* `IER-dynamics.md`
* `IER-ethics.md`
* `IER-denials.md`

No additional documents may be included unless they are strictly necessary to preserve the meaning of the above.

---

## **7. Explicit Non-Inclusions**

The Seed Release must **not** include:

* orientation essays
* experiential introductions
* mathematical formalizations beyond existing text
* historical or comparative analysis
* classic problem surveys
* diagnostics or engineering discussions beyond exclusion
* glossaries, FAQs, or indices
* motivational framing or future research programs

Absence of these materials is **intentional** and does not imply incompleteness or omission.

---

## **8. Venue and Format Neutrality**

The Seed Release may appear in multiple venues, including:

* a public source repository
* a frozen digital or print publication
* archival or timestamping services

No venue confers additional authority.

The same content may be distributed simultaneously in multiple formats without implying revision or hierarchy.

---

## **9. Required Framing Language**

All Seed Release venues must include language equivalent to:

> *This is a Seed Release of Informational Experiential Realism.
> It establishes the identity claim, structural exclusions, and ethical consequences of the theory.
> It is not the complete corpus, not a reference monograph, and not a pedagogical introduction.*

---

## **10. Relationship to Future Work**

All subsequent IER work must be interpretable as:

* elaboration
* clarification
* application
* reorganization
* or pedagogy

Future work must **not**:

* retract the identity claim
* reintroduce diagnostics or certification
* permit graded subjecthood
* deny the ethical consequences already asserted

---

## **Final Statement**

> The IER Seed Release exists so that Informational Experiential Realism
> does not depend on completion in order to exist.
>
> It anchors identity, not presentation.
> It fixes commitments, not pedagogy.
> It establishes reality, not readiness.
