# IER Foundations Book

**Artifact Specification (Verbatim Interface Publication)**

---

## 1. Artifact Identity

**Title:** *Informational Experiential Realism (IER) — Foundations Book*
**Artifact class:** Interface publication
**Epistemic role:** Verbatim foundational subset of the IER corpus
**Authority:** Non-authoritative; defers to the IER Corpus Book for reference, ordering, and pagination

The IER Foundations Book is a **verbatim interface artifact** that presents a curated subset of the IER corpus corresponding to its foundational material.

It exists to make the core foundations of IER available in a compact, distributable form **without reinterpretation or explanatory rewriting**.

---

## 2. Relationship to Other IER Publications

* The **IER Corpus Book** is the sole anchor publication and defines authoritative ordering and pagination.
* The **IER TLDR Book** is an interpretive, expository interface.
* The **Foundations Book** is neither a reference anchor nor an explanatory rewrite.

This artifact occupies a distinct role: **verbatim access to foundational material only**, with minimal framing.

---

## 3. Physical Format

### 3.1 Trim Size

* **Trim size:** **7 × 9 inches**

This trim size is fixed for all editions of the Foundations Book.

### 3.2 Column Model

* **Default page layout:** **Single column**

Two-column layouts are not permitted.

The single-column format supports continuous reading and preserves the integrity of verbatim canonical text.

---

## 4. Design Intent

The Foundations Book is designed as a **compact technical monograph** that emphasizes fidelity, precision, and restraint.

### 4.1 Reading Contract

* Intended for focused, linear reading
* Assumes a technically literate audience
* Does not attempt to orient, motivate, or teach beyond what is present in the source material

The reader encounters the foundations **as written**, not as interpreted.

---

## 5. Content Constraints

### 5.1 Permitted Content

The Foundations Book **may include only**:

1. A short **foreword**
2. Mandatory **disclaimers** describing:

   * its non-authoritative status
   * its relationship to the Corpus Book
   * the fact that it is a subset, not a complete presentation
3. **Verbatim canonical text** drawn from the foundational portion of the IER corpus

### 5.2 Prohibited Content

The Foundations Book **must not** include:

* Summaries or paraphrases
* Explanatory commentary
* Pedagogical framing
* Examples or analogies not present in the source material
* Reordering that alters internal structure within the selected material
* New section headings that do not exist in the source text

No interpretive voice is permitted beyond the foreword and disclaimers.

---

## 6. Fidelity Requirements

* Included material must be reproduced **verbatim**
* Definitions, terminology, and structure must remain unchanged
* No edits, elisions, or clarifications are permitted within the selected text
* Internal ordering of the selected material must be preserved

This artifact is a **faithful extraction**, not an adaptation.

---

## 7. Tone, Density, and Style

* **Tone:** Inherited entirely from the source material
* **Information density:** High
* **Typography:** Conservative, neutral, and unobtrusive
* **Visual pacing:** Compact, monograph-like

The design must not visually signal interpretation or emphasis.

---

## 8. Explicit Non-Goals

The Foundations Book must **not**:

* Function as an onboarding or teaching text
* Serve as a citation or pagination authority
* Replace the Corpus Book
* Compete with the TLDR Book in explanatory clarity
* Introduce any new conceptual framing

Its sole purpose is **faithful access**.

---

## 9. Stability and Change Control

Any change to:

* trim size,
* column policy,
* or the epistemic role of the Foundations Book

requires a corresponding update to IER publishing governance documents and a versioned revision of this specification.

Changes to the *selection* of foundational material do not require changes to this document, provided the role and constraints remain intact.

---

## 10. Edition Integrity

Each edition of the Foundations Book must clearly state:

* the corresponding Corpus Book version
* the scope of material included (foundations only)
* that newer corpus editions may supersede it
