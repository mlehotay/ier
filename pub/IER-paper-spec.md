# IER Paper

**Artifact Specification (Scholarly Paper Publication)**

---

## 1. Artifact Identity

**Title:** *Informational Experiential Realism (IER)*
**Artifact class:** Scholarly paper
**Epistemic role:** Academic presentation and scholarly positioning of IER
**Authority:** Non-authoritative; defers to the IER Corpus Book for definitive structure, ordering, and reference

The IER Paper is a **scholarly communication artifact** intended for dissemination through academic and preprint venues.

It presents IER as a research contribution, not as a reference anchor or complete corpus rendering.

---

## 2. Relationship to Other IER Publications

* The **IER Corpus Book** is the sole anchor publication and defines authoritative ordering and pagination.
* The **IER TLDR Book** is an expository interface for extended explanation.
* The **IER Foundations Book** is a verbatim subset interface.
* The **IER Paper** is a **selective, argumentative presentation** of IER for academic audiences.

The paper does not replace, summarize exhaustively, or supersede any book-length artifact.

---

## 3. Purpose and Scope

The purpose of the IER Paper is to:

* Situate IER within existing scholarly contexts
* Articulate its central claims and contributions
* Motivate its relevance to research communities
* Enable citation, critique, and scholarly discussion

The scope of the paper is **necessarily selective** and **intentionally incomplete** relative to the corpus.

---

## 4. Structural Characteristics

The IER Paper typically includes, in some form:

* An abstract
* An introduction framing the research problem
* A concise overview of the IER framework
* Discussion of key contributions and implications
* Positioning relative to prior work
* Limitations and future directions
* References

Section ordering and emphasis may vary by venue but must remain faithful to the underlying theory.

## 5. Content Constraints

The IER Paper **may**:

* Summarize and paraphrase corpus material
* Emphasize particular aspects of IER for a given audience
* Introduce explanatory framing and scholarly argumentation
* Compare IER to related work

The IER Paper **must not**:

* Introduce new theoretical claims not present in the corpus
* Redefine or alter core terminology
* Establish independent authority over the theory
* Present itself as a complete or definitive specification

The paper argues *for* IER; it does not *define* IER.

---

## 6. Tone and Style

* **Tone:** Scholarly, precise, and argumentative
* **Voice:** Academic research discourse
* **Density:** Moderate to high, constrained by venue norms
* **Audience assumption:** Familiarity with research literature, not with IER specifically

The style must be compatible with peer review and scholarly critique.

---

## 7. Format and Length

* **Format:** Determined by target venue (journal, conference, preprint server)
* **Length:** Venue-constrained; typically far shorter than any book artifact
* **Layout:** Single-column or venue-defined; no intrinsic column requirements

No specific physical geometry is mandated by this specification.

---

## 8. Citation and Reference Policy

* Citations to IER material should preferentially reference:

  * the IER Corpus Book (when possible), or
  * stable canonical identifiers defined upstream
* The paper must clearly state that it is **non-authoritative** with respect to IER’s full definition

The paper may itself be cited independently as a scholarly work.

---

## 9. Explicit Non-Goals

The IER Paper must **not**:

* Serve as a teaching text
* Replace book-length artifacts
* Provide stable pagination for the theory
* Act as an implementation or deployment guide

Its role is **communication**, not consolidation.

---

## 10. Versioning and Change Control

* Updates to the IER Paper may occur independently of book releases
* The paper must always state the IER version it corresponds to
* Changes to core theory require updates upstream, not merely paper revisions

---

## 11. Relationship to Governance

Any change to:

* the epistemic role of the paper,
* its relationship to other IER artifacts,
* or its authority claims

requires a corresponding update to IER publishing governance documents.
