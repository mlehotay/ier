### **Positioning Note**

This book is not written as an intervention within the contemporary philosophy of mind, nor as a contribution to its ongoing debates. While *Informational Experiential Realism* advances an identity claim about experience that overlaps thematically with positions sometimes grouped under labels such as *identity theory*, it was developed independently, without systematic engagement with that literature, and does not presuppose its taxonomies, argumentative priorities, or criteria of success.

Where this book addresses familiar questions—such as what it is for a physical system to have experience, why experience is unified, or what follows ethically from its existence—it does so by introducing a closed structural identity claim and tracing its necessary consequences, rather than by responding to existing positions or attempting to situate itself within a historical lineage.

Readers familiar with the philosophy-of-mind literature may notice points of resemblance or divergence with earlier views, including various forms of physicalism, functionalism, or identity-based accounts. No claim of inheritance, endorsement, or refinement is intended. Apparent similarities should be understood as cases of conceptual overlap rather than shared foundations.

Conversely, the absence of detailed citation or comparative engagement should not be read as dismissal. The decision not to position this book within a specific philosophical discourse is deliberate and structural. The aim here is not to adjudicate between existing theories of mind, but to state as precisely as possible what experience is claimed to be, when it exists, and what necessarily follows if that claim is true.

This book therefore asks to be evaluated on its internal coherence, structural commitments, and consequences—not on its alignment with, or deviation from, any established school or debate.
