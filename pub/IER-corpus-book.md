# IER Corpus Book

**Artifact Specification (Anchor Publication)**

---

## 1. Artifact Identity

**Title:** *Informational Experiential Realism (IER) — Corpus Book*
**Artifact class:** Anchor publication
**Epistemic role:** Reference-grade rendering of the IER corpus
**Authority:** Non-canonical rendering artifact; authoritative structure and content derive from upstream canonical sources

The IER Corpus Book is the **primary anchor publication** for each released version of IER. It defines the stable, citeable reference surface for the theory as a whole.

All other IER publications (including TLDR books, foundations compilations, and preprints) are **interface artifacts** and defer to the Corpus Book for pagination, ordering, and reference.

## 2. Physical Format

### 2.1 Trim Size

* **Trim size:** **8.5 × 11 inches (US Letter)**

This trim size is fixed and mandatory for all editions of the Corpus Book.

### 2.2 Column Model

* **Default page layout:** **Two columns**

The two-column layout is the normative presentation mode throughout the body of the book.

Single-column pages are permitted **only** where required by content constraints, including:

* title and major part-opening pages
* wide tables
* long display equations or formal structures
* full-width figures or diagrams (if any)

---

## 3. Design Intent

The Corpus Book is designed as a **high-density technical reference**, not as a teaching or onboarding text.

### 3.1 Reading Contract

* Assumes a technically literate, motivated reader
* Optimized for lookup, selective reading, and cross-reference
* Not optimized for linear, cover-to-cover reading

### 3.2 Tone and Density

* **Tone:** Formal, technical, declarative
* **Information density:** High
* **Visual pacing:** Compact and economical
* **Headings:** Structural and functional, not pedagogical

The overall design intent is closer to a **technical handbook** than to a narrative monograph.

---

## 4. Typographic and Layout Constraints

Exact typographic parameters are implementation-dependent, but the following constraints define the intended character of the artifact:

* **Body text:** Highly legible technical typography
* **Line spacing:** Tight but readable
* **Paragraph spacing:** Minimal; avoid reader-oriented looseness
* **Tables:** First-class elements; may span columns or pages
* **Footnotes:** Permitted where appropriate
* **Figures and diagrams:** Strongly discouraged; include only when strictly necessary

The visual language should prioritize precision, density, and navigability over approachability.

---

## 5. Structural Requirements

The Corpus Book must preserve:

1. **Stable ordering** of material for a given release
2. **Consistent part and section boundaries**
3. **Stable pagination** within a release version

These properties are essential to its role as the anchor reference artifact.

---

## 6. Explicit Non-Goals

The Corpus Book must **not**:

* Provide pedagogical explanations or tutorials
* Include summaries or “why this matters” commentary
* Offer alternative reading paths or guided tours
* Attempt to simplify or reinterpret the theory for accessibility

Such functions are explicitly delegated to non-anchor interface publications.

---

## 7. Relationship to Other IER Publications

* The **TLDR Book** is a reader-oriented, expository interface artifact and is non-authoritative.
* The **Foundations Compilation** is a verbatim interface artifact containing a defined subset of the corpus.
* Preprints and derivative works defer to the Corpus Book for reference and citation.

Only the Corpus Book serves as the authoritative pagination and reference surface for a released IER version.

---

## 8. Stability and Change Control

Any change to:

* trim size,
* column policy,
* or the epistemic role of the Corpus Book

requires a corresponding update to the IER publishing governance documents and a versioned revision of this specification.
