## **Identity, Evaluation, and the Expectations Identity Theories Refuse**

## **Status Declaration (Binding for Interpretation)**

This document is **NOT CANONICAL** and **NOT PART OF THE IER CORPUS**.

Under the rule defined in `IER-manifest.md`:

> **Non-Corpus Material** — Any file not explicitly enumerated in the manifest is **non-corpus**, regardless of repository location or filename.

Accordingly:

* This document introduces **no ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical commitments**
* It carries **no interpretive or adjudicative authority**
* It may **not** be cited to interpret, defend, or evaluate Informational Experiential Realism (IER)
* If any statement here conflicts with a corpus document—especially `IER-specification.md` or `IER-critics.md`—**the corpus document takes precedence and this document is void at the point of conflict**

This document exists **solely for theory-internal orientation and sanity-checking**.

---

## **Why This Document Exists**

`IER-a-priori.md` explains why identity theories of consciousness attract a predictable family of objections **before any theory-specific commitments are examined**.

`IER-critics.md` adjudicates those objections **as they apply to Informational Experiential Realism**, distinguishing:

* internal threats
* accepted consequences
* and disagreements that reflect incompatible starting points

This document does **neither**.

Instead, it serves a narrower internal purpose:

> **To make explicit which expectations about explanation, access, and evaluation must be abandoned once the identity posture is adopted, and what IER looks like after those expectations are dropped.**

It exists to answer an internal question:

> *“If we stop diagnosing objections and stop adjudicating them neutrally, what expectations does IER explicitly refuse to satisfy, and what remains once those refusals are accepted?”*

This is not a defense.
It is expectation alignment.

---

## **Why This Document Is Not Reader-Facing**

This document must not be reader-facing for **structural reasons**, not rhetorical ones.

### **1. It deliberately collapses levels**

IER enforces strict separation between:

* diagnosing objection structures (`IER-a-priori.md`)
* adjudicating objections (`IER-critics.md`)
* fixing commitments (`IER-specification.md`)
* orienting readers (Part III documents)

This document **deliberately violates that separation** by speaking *from inside* the identity posture and refusing expectations directly.

That is acceptable **only internally**.

---

### **2. Responding directly to a priori identity objections is a category error**

Many objections to identity theories are **not theory-level criticisms**.

They are objections to **identity as a metaphysical strategy**, typically expressed as expectations that identity theories should:

* derive experience from non-experiential parts
* render experience transparent to third-person description
* support diagnostics or detection
* respect conceivability-based modal intuitions
* provide operational reconstruction of phenomenology

Responding to these expectations as if they were ordinary theoretical demands grants a false premise:

> that identity theories owe answers *within the evaluative frame that generated the objection*.

They do not.

The correct response is often:

> **“That expectation already rules out identity.”**

This document violates that discipline **on purpose**, to show what IER would say *if it answered anyway*.

That is precisely why it must not be taken as part of the official dialectic.

---

### **3. Reader-facing documents must preserve evaluative neutrality**

IER’s reader-facing materials may explain disagreement, but must not **pre-empt it**.

This document pre-empts disagreement.
It refuses expectations without apology.

That stance is legitimate—but not reader-facing.

---

## **What This Document Is (and Is Not)**

**This document is:**

* a theory-internal orientation memo
* an expectation-alignment check
* a guard against apologetic drift
* a clarification of refusal boundaries

**This document is not:**

* a rebuttal
* a reader introduction
* a canonical response to critics
* a substitute for `IER-critics.md`

## **I. The Core Expectation Identity Theories Refuse**

### **I.1 Expectation of explanatory ascent**

A persistent expectation in philosophy of mind is that explanation should proceed from:

> non-experiential elements → experiential phenomena

Once experience is identified with a physical regime, this expectation becomes incoherent.

There is no ascent from structure to feel.
There is only identity.

Any framework that promises both strict identity and explanatory ascent is not actually an identity theory.

IER explicitly refuses this expectation.

---

## **II. Expectations IER Refuses to Satisfy**

IER refuses the following expectations **in principle**, not temporarily:

* that experience be derivable in third-person terms
* that “what-it’s-like” be reconstructable from outside the regime
* that experience confer epistemic authority
* that experiential presence be diagnosable
* that phenomenal structure be operationally mapped
* that intuitive satisfaction be preserved

These expectations are not targets for future work.
They are incompatible with identity.

---

## **III. Expectation Refusal Is Not Defect**

IER does not claim to satisfy every reasonable explanatory desire.

IER claims something narrower:

> **If experience is identical to a physical regime, some expectations about explanation, access, and evaluation must be abandoned.**

Where those expectations persist, dissatisfaction is expected.

IER treats that dissatisfaction as a signal of **expectation mismatch**, not theoretical incompleteness.

---

## **IV. Alignment With the Corpus**

Nothing in this document exceeds or revises:

* `IER-specification.md`
* `IER-a-priori.md`
* `IER-critics.md`

Where this document sounds stronger, it is because it removes diagnostic neutrality—not because it adds commitments.

All authoritative content remains unchanged.

## **Appendix A — Internal Expectation Audit Against Standard Identity Objections**

> **Status:**
> Explanatory audit only.
> Introduces no new commitments.
> Evaluates IER *relative to common philosophical expectations*, not by IER’s own success conditions.

---

### **1) Expectation: Identity should explain, not merely relabel**

**IER’s move:**
Explanation under identity consists in **structural exclusion**: showing why nothing weaker than a globally integrated, temporally continuous regime of coherent intrinsic constraint can be the referent of “experience.”

**Expectation refused:**
Third-person-transparent derivation of qualia.

---

### **2) Expectation: The explanatory gap should close**

**IER’s move:**
The gap reflects **structural privacy**: being in the regime is not equivalent to describing it.

**Expectation refused:**
Deductibility of “what-it’s-like” from physical description.

---

### **3) Expectation: Conceivability tracks possibility**

**IER’s move:**
Zombie and inversion intuitions rely on slack-admitting equivalence that IER blocks by identity conditions.

**Expectation refused:**
Modal authority of conceivability.

---

### **4) Expectation: A posteriori necessity must be cashed out Kripke-style**

**IER’s move:**
Necessity follows from referent identity, not epistemic route.

**Expectation refused:**
Full rigid-designator machinery as a prerequisite.

---

### **5) Expectation: Identity must choose between chauvinism and functionalism**

**IER’s move:**
The identity is regime-level and substrate-neutral in principle.

**Expectation refused:**
Comparative diagnostics across substrates.

---

### **6) Expectation: Type identity must be low-level**

**IER’s move:**
Type identity of regimes; token identity of instantiations.

**Expectation refused:**
Neural-type-level identity.

---

### **7) Expectation: The selection problem must have a local answer**

**IER’s move:**
The relevant unit is the regime, not local states.

**Expectation refused:**
State-level selector rules.

---

### **8) Expectation: Boundaries must be externally detectable**

**IER’s move:**
Boundaries are defined by shared intrinsic constraint over time.

**Expectation refused:**
External certification of boundaries.

---

### **9) Expectation: Minimal consciousness criteria must be microphysical**

**IER’s move:**
Sustaining a UEF is the minimal condition; slack blocks experience categorically.

**Expectation refused:**
Thresholds in bits, neurons, or Φ.

---

### **10) Expectation: Qualia should be predictively mapped**

**IER’s move:**
Qualia are differences in constraint organization.

**Expectation refused:**
Outside-in prediction of specific feels.

---

### **11) Expectation: Phenomenal structure must be operationally recoverable**

**IER’s move:**
Experiential relations track constraint relations.

**Expectation refused:**
Operational reconstruction pipelines.

---

### **12) Expectation: Unity requires binding mechanisms**

**IER’s move:**
Unity is global constraint, not binding.

**Expectation refused:**
Representational binding accounts.

---

### **13) Expectation: Temporal phenomenology must be independently explained**

**IER’s move:**
Temporal continuity is built into regime persistence.

**Expectation refused:**
Standalone specious-present theory.

---

### **14) Expectation: First-/third-person asymmetry should dissolve**

**IER’s move:**
Asymmetry follows from intrinsic constraint.

**Expectation refused:**
Asymmetry elimination.

---

### **15) Expectation: Introspection and neuroscience must reconcile**

**IER’s move:**
Inside and outside descriptions are categorically different.

**Expectation refused:**
Reconciliation program.

---

### **16) Expectation: Avoiding eliminativism requires measurability**

**IER’s move:**
Identity blocks elimination by redescription.

**Expectation refused:**
“Real” = “measurable.”

---

### **17) Expectation: Identity claims must not preload the explanandum**

**IER’s move:**
Non-arbitrariness is carried by exclusion arguments.

**Expectation refused:**
Neutral explanandum agreement.

---

### **18) Expectation: Adequate theories must be empirically tractable**

**IER’s move:**
Compatibility with neuroscience without diagnostics.

**Expectation refused:**
Empirical control as adequacy condition.

---

### **19) Expectation: Explanation must run from neuroscience to phenomenology**

**IER’s move:**
Identity plus participation vocabulary replaces correlation.

**Expectation refused:**
Externally usable explanatory pipeline.

---

### **20) Expectation: Panpsychism must be blocked gently**

**IER’s move:**
Slack exclusion blocks trivial consciousness categorically.

**Expectation refused:**
Permissive or graded consciousness.

---

### **21) Expectation: Ontological economy must preserve access**

**IER’s move:**
No new primitives; privacy is structural.

**Expectation refused:**
Access-preserving economy.

---

### **22) Expectation: The theory should motivate acceptance**

**IER’s move:**
IER trades engineering control for ontological strictness.

**Expectation refused:**
Motivational adequacy for all audiences.

---

## **Closing Statement**

IER is not built to satisfy every expectation philosophers bring to theories of consciousness.

It is built to say **one strict thing clearly**:

> **Experience is identical to a particular kind of physical regime.**

Once that is accepted, many familiar expectations must be abandoned.

This document exists to make those abandoned expectations explicit—**internally**—so that IER remains honest about what it refuses to provide and why.
