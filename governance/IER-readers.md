# IER Readers and Use Contexts

**Audience Analysis, Positioning, and Reading Patterns**

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document describes the **intended readers, use contexts, and reading patterns** associated with the various IER publications.

Its purpose is to:

* clarify who different IER artifacts are for,
* explain how readers are expected to interact with those artifacts,
* surface common risks and misalignments in reader expectations,
* support coherent editorial and publishing decisions.

This document is **informational and advisory**. It does not define theory, publication authority, or artifact specifications.

## 2. Scope and Non-Goals

### 2.1 Scope

This document applies to:

* the IER Corpus Book,
* the IER TLDR Book,
* the IER Foundations Book,
* the IER Paper and related scholarly outputs.

### 2.2 Non-Goals

This document does **not**:

* define IER concepts or claims,
* prescribe book formats, trim sizes, or layouts,
* establish publication authority,
* define marketing or outreach strategy,
* override publishing or deployment governance.

## 3. Conceptual Model of Readers

### 3.1 Readers Are Not Artifacts

Readers are heterogeneous, while artifacts are **interfaces**.

A single reader may interact with multiple artifacts over time, and the same artifact may be used very differently by different readers.

### 3.2 Axes of Reader Variation

Readers vary along multiple independent dimensions, including:

* familiarity with IER,
* tolerance for formal abstraction,
* disciplinary background,
* motivation (learning, critique, application, reference),
* preferred reading mode (linear, selective, lookup).

No single artifact is optimized for all combinations of these factors.

## 4. Primary Reader Groups

The following groups are analytical categories, not personas.

### 4.1 First-Contact Explorers

**Characteristics**

* Little or no prior exposure to IER
* Often encounter IER via recommendation, citation, or curiosity
* May not share the theory’s native vocabulary

**Motivations**

* Determine whether IER is relevant or interesting
* Gain a high-level understanding of its claims

**Risks**

* Confusing interface artifacts with authoritative ones
* Expecting immediate clarity from reference-grade material

---

### 4.2 Technically Engaged Learners

**Characteristics**

* Willing to invest time and cognitive effort
* Comfortable with abstract reasoning
* Often transitioning from first contact to deeper engagement

**Motivations**

* Understand the internal logic of IER
* Build a coherent mental model

**Risks**

* Over-reliance on expository material
* Premature engagement with the corpus without orientation

---

### 4.3 Practitioners and Applied Readers

**Characteristics**

* Interested in applying IER concepts to real-world systems
* Often selective readers
* May not read artifacts linearly

**Motivations**

* Extract useful conceptual tools
* Map theory to practice

**Risks**

* Skipping foundational material
* Treating examples or summaries as normative definitions

---

### 4.4 Researchers and Scholars

**Characteristics**

* Familiar with academic discourse
* Expect clear positioning relative to prior work
* Often engage critically rather than receptively

**Motivations**

* Evaluate IER as a research contribution
* Cite, critique, or extend the work

**Risks**

* Assuming the paper exhaustively defines the theory
* Expecting venue-constrained artifacts to serve as full specifications

---

### 4.5 Reference-Oriented Users

**Characteristics**

* Already familiar with IER
* Use artifacts non-linearly
* Prioritize precision and stability

**Motivations**

* Look up definitions or formal claims
* Verify details

**Risks**

* Frustration when using non-anchor artifacts for reference
* Confusion when pagination or ordering differs across artifacts

## 5. Artifact–Reader Relationships

### 5.1 IER Corpus Book

**Serves well**

* Reference-oriented users
* Advanced learners
* Practitioners needing precise definitions

**Serves poorly (by design)**

* First-contact explorers
* Readers seeking narrative guidance

**Typical usage**

* Lookup
* Cross-referencing
* Selective deep dives

---

### 5.2 IER TLDR Book

**Serves well**

* First-contact explorers
* Technically engaged learners
* Readers seeking conceptual orientation

**Limitations**

* Not suitable for citation or authoritative reference
* Incomplete by design

**Typical usage**

* Linear reading
* Conceptual synthesis
* Preparation for corpus engagement

---

### 5.3 IER Foundations Book

**Serves well**

* Readers seeking direct access to core material
* Scholars wanting verbatim foundations
* Readers who distrust interpretive layers

**Limitations**

* Not explanatory
* Not comprehensive
* Assumes reader patience and focus

**Typical usage**

* Focused, linear reading
* Verification of foundational claims

---

### 5.4 IER Paper

**Serves well**

* Researchers and scholars
* Readers evaluating IER’s relevance to existing work

**Limitations**

* Selective and incomplete
* Venue-constrained
* Not a substitute for book-length artifacts

**Typical usage**

* Scholarly reading
* Citation
* Comparative evaluation

## 6. Reading Trajectories (Descriptive, Not Prescriptive)

Common observed or anticipated paths include:

* TLDR Book → Corpus Book
* Paper → TLDR Book → Corpus Book
* Foundations Book → Corpus Book
* Selective Corpus lookup → Paper citation

These trajectories are **emergent**, not required.

---

## 7. Framing and Tone Guidance (Advisory)

### 7.1 Explanation vs. Precision

* Explanatory artifacts should prioritize clarity
* Anchor artifacts should prioritize precision
* Mixing these goals in a single artifact degrades both

### 7.2 Signaling Artifact Roles

Clear signaling of artifact roles reduces:

* misuse,
* reader frustration,
* misattribution of authority.

Front matter and introductory framing are especially important.

---

## 8. Common Failure Modes

* Treating the TLDR Book as authoritative
* Expecting the Corpus Book to teach
* Expecting the Foundations Book to explain
* Treating the paper as a complete specification

These failures are predictable and should be mitigated through clear framing, not by weakening artifact boundaries.

### Premature Dismissal Due to Artifact–Expectation Misalignment

Some technically sophisticated readers disengage early when an IER artifact violates their default expectations about form, pedagogy, or presentation order (e.g., reference-first structure, point-form exposition, or length without narrative scaffolding).

In such cases, non-engagement may be retrospectively framed as a judgment about the coherence, seriousness, or viability of the underlying theory, rather than as a mismatch between reader expectations and the artifact’s intended role.

This failure mode is most likely when:

* reference-grade or foundations material is encountered as first contact,
* the reader expects interpretive or explanatory guidance by default,
* or informal evaluative feedback is offered without commitment to full engagement.

Mitigation relies on clearer signaling of artifact roles, earlier redirection to orientation materials, and disciplined separation between explanatory and anchor artifacts—not on increasing explanatory burden within reference-grade texts.

## 9. Relationship to Governance

This document:

* informs editorial and publication decisions,
* complements publishing and deployment governance,
* does not override or redefine any governance policy.

Where conflicts appear, governance documents take precedence.

---

## 10. Change Policy

* This document may evolve independently of artifact releases
* Updates do not require republication of books
* Revisions should clarify, not redefine, reader relationships
