## **Projection Discipline for Constraint Geometry**

### **NON-CANONICAL · NON-CORPUS · NOT READER-FACING**

---

## **Status Declaration (Binding for Interpretation)**

This document is **NOT CANONICAL** and **NOT PART OF THE IER CORPUS**.

Under the rule defined in `IER-manifest.md`:

> **Non-Corpus Material** — Any file not explicitly enumerated in the manifest is **non-corpus**, regardless of repository location or filename.

Accordingly:

* This document introduces **no ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical commitments**
* It carries **no interpretive or adjudicative authority**
* It may **not** be cited to interpret, defend, evaluate, or extend Informational Experiential Realism (IER)
* If any statement here conflicts with a corpus document—especially
  `IER-specification.md`, `IER-theory.md`, `IER-dynamics.md`, or `IER-topology.md`—
  **the corpus document takes precedence and this document is void at the point of conflict**

This document exists **solely for internal author coordination, projection hygiene, and scope control**.

---

## **1. Purpose of This Document**

IER explains several central domains—time, memory, identity, agency, history, and possibility—as **distinct projections of a single underlying constraint geometry**.

That structural claim is made **canonically and exclusively** in:

```
IER-topology.md
```

This document does **not** restate or justify that claim.

Its sole purpose is to:

* identify **which existing corpus documents function as the six projection anchors**, and
* specify a **uniform explanatory interface** that each projection article must implement.

This prevents:

* silent scope creep,
* cross-projection leakage,
* accidental hierarchy,
* and gradual reintroduction of faculty models.

---

## **2. The Six Constraint Projections (As Implemented in the Corpus)**

The following table identifies the **actual projection owners**, based strictly on the manifest.

No new documents are implied.

| Projection Domain | Canonical Projection Article |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Time**          | `IER-continuity.md`          |
| **Memory**        | `IER-memory.md`              |
| **Identity**      | `IER-identity.md`            |
| **Agency**        | `IER-agency.md`              |
| **History**       | `IER-sedimentation.md`       |
| **Possibility**   | `IER-futures.md`             |

Supporting or downstream documents may elaborate cases, but **projection authority lives only in these six files**.

---

## **3. Required Interface: “Explanatory Orientation” Section**

Each of the six projection articles **must contain** a clearly labeled subsection titled:

> **Explanatory Orientation**

This section is mandatory.

It may be brief, but it must **substantively satisfy all six requirements below**.

---

### **I-1. Question Ownership**

Each projection must explicitly state **the single explanatory question it answers**.

Canonical ownership:

* Time → *What is happening now?*
* Memory → *What remains reachable?*
* Identity → *Who is bearing this?*
* Agency → *Is this resolution owned?*
* History → *Why is the system shaped this way?*
* Possibility → *What could still occur?*

A projection **must not** attempt to answer any other hexad question.

---

### **I-2. Foregrounded Aspect of Constraint**

Each projection must state **which aspect of constraint geometry it foregrounds**, e.g.:

* asymmetry / traversal
* reachability
* ownership persistence
* collapse
* sedimentation
* topological openness

This is an **orientation choice**, not a new structure.

---

### **I-3. Fixed Structure**

Each projection must state **what is treated as invariant** throughout the explanation.

Examples:

* system boundary
* existence of admissible futures
* irreversibility of resolution
* current intrinsic constraint state

This blocks illicit inference across projections.

---

### **I-4. Allowed Variation**

Each projection must state **what is allowed to vary** within its account.

Examples:

* participation pathways
* narrowing of choice spaces
* loss of degrees of freedom
* accessibility under current constraint

Variation must remain internal to the projection’s own question.

---

### **I-5. Projection-Specific Non-Claims**

Each projection must include **explicit refusals** tailored to its domain.

Examples:

* Time → no privileged present, no spacetime metaphysics
* Memory → no storage, traces, or retention
* Identity → no psychological or narrative criteria
* Agency → no indeterminism or executive controller
* History → no stored past, replay, or encoded traces
* Possibility → no probability, modal realism, or optimization

These refusals are **structural containment**, not disclaimers.

---

### **I-6. Mandatory Deferral Clause**

Each projection article must include the following sentence verbatim, or in trivially equivalent form:

> **Unification with other constraint projections is handled exclusively in `IER-topology.md`.**

No projection may perform synthesis, reconciliation, or cross-domain explanation.

---

## **4. Global Prohibitions (Across All Projections)**

A projection article must **not**:

* redefine constraint geometry
* privilege its projection as foundational
* infer claims licensed only in another projection
* explain another projection’s question “in passing”
* import psychological, epistemic, or narrative criteria
* introduce metrics, diagnostics, or optimization language

Violations constitute **scope errors**, not stylistic differences.

---

## **5. Relation to `IER-hexad.md`**

This document has **no authority over** and **no visibility within** `IER-hexad.md`.

* `IER-hexad.md` is **reader-facing and navigational**
* `IER-interface.md` is **internal and methodological**

The hexad **names** the six projections.
This interface **disciplines how they are written**.

No reference to this file should appear in any corpus document.

---

## **6. Internal Enforcement Rule**

During drafting, revision, or review of any projection article:

* Failure to implement all six interface requirements is an **internal error**
* Reader intuition or elegance does **not** excuse omission
* Redundancy across projections signals leakage
* Successful isolation is more important than local completeness

This document exists to prevent **gradual theoretical drift**, not to constrain prose.

---

## **Intermission — Structural Fact**

> **The interface adds nothing to IER.
> It makes explicit what the theory already forces.**

# **Appendix A — IER Projection Style Audit (One-Page)**

**Purpose**
This audit checks whether a projection article:

1. fully implements its **Explanatory Orientation**, and
2. remains **strictly isolated** from the other five projections.

It is **not** an evaluation of elegance, pedagogy, or reader comfort.

---

## **A. Orientation Integrity (Hard Requirements)**

✔︎ / ✘ for each item. Any ✘ is a revision requirement.

### **A1. Question Ownership**

* [ ] The article explicitly answers **exactly one** hexad question.
* [ ] The question is stated verbatim or near-verbatim in the Explanatory Orientation.
* [ ] No other hexad question is answered, implied, or “helpfully clarified” elsewhere.

> **Fail signal:** phrases like “this also explains why… (memory/agency/etc.)”

---

### **A2. Foregrounded Aspect of Constraint**

* [ ] One aspect of constraint geometry is clearly foregrounded.
* [ ] That aspect remains stable throughout the article.
* [ ] Other aspects are not invoked except as background givens.

> **Fail signal:** multiple constraint aspects treated as co-equal explanatory drivers.

---

### **A3. Fixed Structure**

* [ ] The article states what is treated as invariant.
* [ ] Those invariants are never questioned or renegotiated later.
* [ ] No “edge cases” are introduced that undermine invariance.

> **Fail signal:** “in most cases,” “usually,” “unless,” applied to fixed structure.

---

### **A4. Allowed Variation**

* [ ] All variation described falls *inside* the projection’s question.
* [ ] Variation is structural, not representational or psychological.
* [ ] Variation does not require concepts owned by other projections.

> **Fail signal:** variation explained via memory content, identity criteria, or choice deliberation when not licensed.

---

## **B. Projection Isolation (Leakage Tests)**

Each item below should be **absent** unless explicitly refused.

### **B1. Time Leakage**

* [ ] No privileged present
* [ ] No temporal containers or timelines
* [ ] No stored sequences

(Allowed only in **Time**)

---

### **B2. Memory Leakage**

* [ ] No storage metaphors
* [ ] No traces, records, or retention
* [ ] No “remembered past” as an object

(Allowed only in **Memory**)

---

### **B3. Identity Leakage**

* [ ] No psychological similarity criteria
* [ ] No narrative continuity
* [ ] No autobiographical dependence

(Allowed only in **Identity**)

---

### **B4. Agency Leakage**

* [ ] No deliberation or option representation
* [ ] No executive controller
* [ ] No freedom-as-exemption language

(Allowed only in **Agency**)

---

### **B5. History Leakage**

* [ ] No stored past states
* [ ] No replay or encoded history
* [ ] No causal influence from non-existent past entities

(Allowed only in **History**)

---

### **B6. Possibility Leakage**

* [ ] No probability or likelihood
* [ ] No imagined alternatives
* [ ] No optimization or preference ranking

(Allowed only in **Possibility**)

---

## **C. Topology Discipline**

### **C1. No Local Synthesis**

* [ ] The article does **not** unify projections.
* [ ] It does not explain how its account “fits with” others.
* [ ] It does not restate topology arguments.

> **Fail signal:** “Taken together with memory/identity/agency…”

---

### **C2. Mandatory Deferral Clause**

* [ ] The deferral sentence is present verbatim or trivially equivalent.
* [ ] No synthesis occurs after the clause.

---

## **D. Language Hygiene (Soft but Important)**

Not immediate failures, but strong drift indicators.

* [ ] Minimal metaphor; metaphors explicitly bounded
* [ ] No faculty-style nouns (“the memory system,” “identity module”)
* [ ] No epistemic language doing ontological work
* [ ] Constraint remains **structural**, not descriptive of experience contents

---

## **E. Pass / Revise Decision**

* **PASS** if all A- and B-items pass.
* **REVISE** if:

  * any A-item fails, or
  * two or more B-items fail, or
  * topology synthesis appears anywhere.

---

## **F. Optional Annotation (1–3 sentences)**

> *Where does this article most tempt projection leakage?*
> *(This is for author awareness, not publication.)*

# **Appendix B — Methodology for Projection Audits**

**Status:** Internal · Non-Canonical · Non-Corpus
**Audience:** Authors, editors, and auditors working on projection articles
**Authority:** Procedural only (no ontological or theoretical force)

---

## **B.1 Purpose of This Appendix**

This appendix specifies **how projection audits are to be conducted** and **how discrepancies are to be resolved** when evaluating corpus projection articles against the interface defined in this document.

It exists to prevent:

* circular revision,
* silent interface drift,
* retrofitting orientations to legacy prose,
* and erosion of projection isolation under explanatory pressure.

This appendix **adds no theory** and **introduces no new constraints** beyond those already implicit in the interface.

---

## **B.2 Orientation Sections as Normative Interfaces**

The **Explanatory Orientation** section of each projection article functions as a **normative interface contract**, not as a descriptive summary.

Methodologically:

* The Orientation is treated as **idealized**.
* It is written **as if the projection were perfectly isolated**.
* It assumes **no legacy prose, pedagogical compromises, or cross-projection pressure**.
* It specifies **what the article is obligated to implement**, not what it currently does.

An Orientation therefore plays the role of a **type signature** or **interface definition**, not an implementation.

---

## **B.3 Direction of Audit Authority (Asymmetry Rule)**

All projection audits are **asymmetric**.

Authority flows in the following direction:

```
IER-interface.md
        ↓
Explanatory Orientation (normative)
        ↓
Projection Article Body (implementation)
```

Consequences:

* The Orientation is **presumed correct by default**.
* The article body is **presumed revisable**.
* Mismatch is interpreted as **implementation error**, not interface error.

The question an audit answers is therefore:

> **Does the article implement its Orientation?**

—not whether the Orientation matches the article.

---

## **B.4 What Gets Edited First**

### **Default rule**

When an article fails an audit:

* **Edit the article body**, not the Orientation.

This holds even if:

* the prose is elegant,
* the explanation feels theoretically satisfying,
* the result is widely relied on elsewhere,
* or the broader theory “needs” the result.

Those needs must be met **in the correct projection owner**, not by weakening isolation.

---

## **B.5 When an Orientation May Be Revised**

Revising an Orientation is permitted **only** if one of the following conditions is met:

### **B5.1 Interface violation**

The Orientation itself:

* answers more than one hexad question,
* foregrounds multiple constraint aspects,
* performs synthesis,
* imports ethics, diagnostics, probability, or identity criteria,
* or violates any rule in Section 3 or Section 4 of this document.

### **B5.2 Misassigned projection ownership**

The Orientation claims ownership of a question that:

* contradicts the manifest,
* conflicts with another projection’s exclusive domain,
* or cannot be answered in isolation without contradiction.

### **B5.3 Structural impossibility**

The Orientation demands an implementation that **cannot be realized at all** without violating another projection’s ownership.

> This is a failure of the interface design, not of prose.

Absent one of these conditions, the Orientation **must not be altered** during an audit.

---

## **B.6 Handling Audit Failures in Article Bodies**

When an article fails an audit relative to its Orientation, each offending passage must be classified and addressed as one of the following:

1. **Delete**
   If the passage is redundant or non-essential.

2. **Relocate**
   If the passage correctly belongs to another projection owner.

3. **Rephrase**
   If the passage can be rewritten to remain strictly within the current projection’s question.

No passage may remain in place on the grounds that it is “helpful,” “intuitive,” or “clarifying” if it violates projection isolation.

---

## **B.7 No Local Synthesis Rule (Enforcement Clarification)**

Projection articles must not:

* reconcile their account with other projections,
* explain why apparent conflicts dissolve,
* resolve cross-projection puzzles,
* or pre-emptively defend the theory against objections grounded in other projections.

Such synthesis is handled **exclusively** in:

```
IER-topology.md
```

The presence of the mandatory deferral clause does **not** license synthesis elsewhere in the article.

---

## **B.8 Implications for Legacy Prose**

Many existing projection articles were written **before** the interface discipline was fully explicit.

Therefore:

* Audit failures should be treated as **expected**, not as errors in theory.
* Revision should be **surgical**, not defensive.
* Loss of local completeness is acceptable.
* Isolation takes priority over explanatory breadth.

A projection article is allowed to feel **incomplete by design**.

---

## **B.9 Methodological Principle (Binding)**

> **Orientations are contracts.
> Articles are implementations.
> Implementations bend; contracts do not—unless the contract itself is broken.**

This principle governs all future drafting, revision, and review of projection articles.

---

## **B.10 Scope Reminder**

This appendix:

* has no authority outside internal workflow,
* must not be cited in corpus documents,
* must not be summarized for readers,
* and must not be used to introduce new theoretical commitments.

It exists solely to **stabilize projection discipline over time**.
