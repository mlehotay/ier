# IER: Required Positions on Harm, Duty, Responsibility, Obligation, and Blame

This section states **what IER is committed to**, **what it must explicitly block**, and **where elaboration may occur without adding authority**.

---

## 1. Harm Comes First (Conceptually and Normatively)

### What must be stated

IER enforces a strict priority:

> **Harm is a structural fact.
> Duty, responsibility, obligation, and blame are downstream interpretive layers.**

Specifically:

* Experiential moral harm is defined **independently** of:

  * intention
  * justification
  * duty
  * responsibility
  * blame
* Whether harm occurred is determined **solely** by:

  * damage to the organization of intrinsic constraint
  * within a Unified Experiential Field

### What must be blocked

IER must explicitly reject:

* “If no one is responsible, no harm occurred”
* “If harm was justified, it doesn’t count”
* “If no duty was violated, no harm occurred”
* “If no one is to blame, no harm occurred”

> **Harm does not wait for moral bookkeeping.**

This is already implicit in E3 and must be preserved everywhere.

## 2. Duty Is Not Harm-Minimization

### What must be stated (IER-duty.md alignment)

IER **does not** define duty as:

* minimizing harm
* preventing all harm
* choosing the least harmful outcome
* optimizing experiential structure

Instead:

> **Duty concerns how intrinsic constraint becomes organized around action under uncertainty, not how outcomes score.**

Under IER:

* Duty is **structural**, not consequentialist
* Duty does **not** guarantee harm avoidance
* Fulfilling one duty may still cause harm
* Failing to prevent harm does **not** automatically imply duty violation

### What must be blocked

IER must reject:

* “If you had a duty, you must have been responsible for the harm”
* “If you did your duty, no harm occurred”
* “Duty determines whether harm counts”

Duty **never** retroactively edits harm.

## 3. Responsibility Tracks Authorship and Access — Not Harm Magnitude

### What must be stated

IER draws a clean distinction:

> **Harm tracks structure.
> Responsibility tracks authorship and access.**

Responsibility scales with:

* degree of causal authorship
* access to alternative actions
* coherence of agency
* level of coercion or constraint
* epistemic access to structural risk (not outcome certainty)

Crucially:

* **Responsibility is graded**
* **Harm is not**

A small harm may involve high responsibility.
A catastrophic harm may involve none.

### What must be blocked

IER must reject:

* “Greater harm implies greater responsibility”
* “No responsibility implies no harm”
* “Diffuse harm erases responsibility”
* “Ignorance automatically removes responsibility”

Reduced capacity mitigates responsibility, **not damage**.

## 4. Obligation Is Not Global and Not Retrospective

### What must be stated

Under IER:

* Obligation is **local**, **situated**, and **constraint-shaped**
* Obligation does **not** arise merely because harm is possible
* Obligation does **not** arise from:

  * moral standing alone
  * harm magnitude alone
  * hindsight outcome evaluation

IER allows:

* genuine obligation under uncertainty
* conflicting obligations
* obligations that cannot all be satisfied

### What must be blocked

IER must reject:

* “If harm occurred, someone must have violated an obligation”
* “Obligation implies harm-prevention success”
* “Moral obligation expands to cover all possible harms”

IER blocks obligation inflation.

## 5. Blame Is Optional, Secondary, and Often Inappropriate

### What must be stated

IER treats blame as:

* **non-fundamental**
* **non-required**
* **derivative of responsibility**, not harm

Blame may be:

* appropriate
* mitigated
* suspended
* or entirely absent

Even when harm is real.

IER explicitly allows:

* harm without blame
* harm with justified action
* harm without moral fault
* harm where blame would itself be harmful

### What must be blocked

IER must reject:

* “If harm occurred, blame is owed”
* “Blame tracks harm magnitude”
* “Blame is necessary for moral recognition”
* “Absence of blame trivializes harm”

Blame is **never** a condition for harm’s moral reality.

## 6. Justification Never Cancels Harm

(This must be stated **everywhere** harm is discussed.)

### What must be stated

IER enforces a three-way separation:

1. **Harm** — structural damage to experiential organization
2. **Justification** — reasons an action may be permitted
3. **Blame** — moral appraisal of the agent

These are **logically independent**.

An action may be:

* harmful and justified
* harmful and unjustified
* harmful and blameless
* harmful and tragic

### What must be blocked

IER must reject:

* “Justified harm is not really harm”
* “Necessary harm doesn’t count”
* “Preventing worse harm erases the harm done”

---

## 7. Tragedy Is a First-Class Moral Outcome

### What must be stated

IER must explicitly allow:

> **Cases where harm is unavoidable regardless of action.**

In such cases:

* Harm occurs
* Duty may still have been fulfilled
* Responsibility may be absent or diffuse
* Blame may be inappropriate
* Moral residue remains

This is not a failure of the framework.
It is a **forced consequence** of taking experience seriously.

## 8. What a Separate `IER-responsibility.md` May Do (and May Not Do)

### It MAY:

* Explain how responsibility scales with agency and access
* Clarify coercion, incapacity, emergency, and ignorance
* Analyze responsibility in distributed or institutional contexts
* Separate causal responsibility from moral responsibility
* Explain why responsibility does not track harm magnitude

### It MUST NOT:

* Redefine harm
* Introduce responsibility thresholds
* License blame or punishment
* Collapse responsibility into obligation
* Collapse responsibility into harm prevention
* Add decision procedures

It must remain **explanatory and non-normative**, like `IER-duty.md`.

## Minimal Canonical Summary (You Can Paste This Anywhere)

> **Under IER, experiential moral harm is a structural fact about damaged experience.
> Duty concerns how constraint organizes action under uncertainty.
> Responsibility tracks authorship and access, not outcome severity.
> Obligation is local and non-totalizing.
> Blame is optional, derivative, and often inappropriate.
> Justification never erases harm.
> Tragedy is real.**
