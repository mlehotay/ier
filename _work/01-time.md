# **Plan: Interface-Compliant Update of `IER-continuity.md` (Time Projection)**

## **Goal State**

After revision, `IER-continuity.md` must:

1. **Contain the Explanatory Orientation verbatim (or trivially equivalent)**
2. **Answer only** the Time question:
   **“What is happening now?”**
3. Foreground **asymmetry / traversal** *only*
4. Contain **no explanations of identity, ethics, memory, history, or possibility**
5. Include **no local synthesis**
6. Defer all unification explicitly to `IER-topology.md`

---

## **Phase 0 — Orientation Insertion (Mechanical)**

### Step 0.1 — Insert Orientation

* Insert the approved **Explanatory Orientation (Time)** immediately after:

  * the title header, and
  * before the Abstract.
* Do **not** adapt the Orientation to fit existing prose.
* Treat it as **normative**.

### Step 0.2 — Freeze Orientation

* No further edits to the Orientation unless an interface violation is discovered.
* All subsequent work treats it as a **contract**.

---

## **Phase 1 — Structural Re-scoping (High-Level)**

### Step 1.1 — Reclassify Article Purpose

Change the article’s *implicit purpose* from:

> “Explain time, continuity, interruption, identity persistence, and ethical implications”

to:

> **“Explain how temporal passage, flow, and interruption arise *while experience exists*, as features of irreversible constraint traversal.”**

Anything not strictly needed for that purpose is **out of scope**.

---

## **Phase 2 — Section-by-Section Audit & Action**

Below is a **decision table** for each major section of the current article.

---

### **Abstract**

**Problem**

* Answers multiple hexad questions (Time + Identity + Ethics).
* Pre-solves “rebirth” and “persistence” puzzles.

**Action**

* **Rewrite** abstract to include only:

  * time as asymmetry,
  * experience as regime requiring nonzero coherence,
  * interruption as absence of temporal regime.
* **Remove**:

  * “persons persist as systems”
  * any ethical framing
  * future-capacity language

**Replacement intent**

> “This article explains why experience exhibits passage and ‘now’ while present, and why temporal flow ceases during interruption, without invoking stored sequences or privileged instants.”

---

### **§1 The Apparent Problems of Time and Experiential Gaps**

**Problem**

* Frames identity and rebirth as problems Time must solve.

**Action**

* **Retain**: discussion of flow, now, direction, interruption.
* **Delete or relocate**:

  * “rebirth,” “death,” “subject persistence”
* **Reframe**:

  * Gaps are temporal absences, not identity threats.

**Allowed claim**

> “When no regime is present, there is no experiential time.”

**Forbidden claim**

> “Therefore the same person persists.”

---

### **§2 IER Commitments Presupposed**

**Problem**

* Includes future-oriented persistence and identity claims.

**Action**

* **Prune list** to only commitments required for Time:

  * regime ontology
  * intrinsic constraint
  * irreversibility
* **Remove**:

  * “future-oriented persistence”
  * anything about what “matters”

---

### **§3 Unified Experiential Fields as Temporal Regimes**

**Mostly acceptable**, with edits:

#### §3.1 What a UEF Is (and Is Not)

* Keep regime vs object distinction.
* Remove any implication that regime persistence grounds identity.

#### §3.2 Specious Present

* Keep entirely.
* Explicitly remind: this is about **existence of ‘now’**, not memory or selfhood.

#### §3.3 Experiential Flow Without Snapshots

* Keep.
* Replace “across successive windows” with language that avoids counting or sequencing (no proto-memory).

#### §3.4 Memory Does Not Unify Experience

**Problem**

* Answers Memory’s question.

**Action**

* Either:

  * **Delete entirely**, or
  * Replace with a single **refusal sentence**:

    > “This account does not explain reachability or re-accessibility; those belong to the Memory projection.”

---

### **§4 Time as Asymmetric Constraint Traversal**

**Core section — keep and strengthen**

**Action**

* Make this the **explanatory center of gravity**.
* Emphasize:

  * elimination of alternatives *as it occurs*,
  * asymmetry as what “now” consists in.
* Avoid:

  * “future space”
  * “what could still occur”

---

### **§5 Persistence Without Continuous Experience**

**Hard violation (Identity)**

**Action**

* **Remove entire section** from this article.
* Mark for relocation to:

  * `IER-identity.md` (system persistence),
  * with a pointer if needed.

**Replacement (optional)**
A short Time-only section:

> **5. Temporal Absence**
> When no Unified Experiential Field exists, there is no experiential time. This is a temporal fact, not an identity claim.

---

### **§6 Regime States and Transitions (Sleep, Dreaming, etc.)**

**Mixed status**

**Action**

* Keep **only** descriptions that concern:

  * presence/absence of temporal regime,
  * whether “now” exists.
* Remove:

  * ethical commentary,
  * agency impairment,
  * capacity preservation language.

**Example rewrite**

* Dreamless sleep: “no temporal regime; no ‘now’”
* Dreaming: “temporal regime present, reconfigured”
* Anesthesia: “temporal regime forcibly absent”

No “who,” no “standing,” no “future.”

---

### **§7 Death as Irreversible Capacity Loss**

**Out of scope (Identity + Ethics + Possibility)**

**Action**

* **Remove entirely** from this article.
* Relocate to:

  * `IER-identity.md` and/or `IER-ethics.md`.

---

### **§8 Ethical Orientation**

**Forbidden in Time**

**Action**

* **Delete entirely.**

---

### **§9 What This Account Does Not Do**

**Good, but incomplete**

**Action**

* Add explicit non-claims aligned with the Orientation:

  * no identity persistence
  * no memory reachability
  * no ethical standing
  * no future openness
  * no historical explanation

---

### **§10 Conclusion**

**Problem**

* Synthesizes Time + Identity.

**Action**

* Rewrite to a **Time-only close**, e.g.:

> “Time, under IER, is the irreversible traversal of intrinsic constraint while a Unified Experiential Field exists. When the regime exists, there is a now. When it does not, there is no experiential time. Nothing more is claimed here.”

---

## **Phase 3 — Final Interface Checks**

Before declaring PASS:

* [ ] Orientation present and unchanged
* [ ] Only Time question answered
* [ ] Only asymmetry / traversal used as explanatory driver
* [ ] No identity, memory, ethics, possibility, or history explanations
* [ ] Deferral clause present
* [ ] No synthesis after deferral

---

## **Phase 4 — Deferred Work (Explicitly Not in This File)**

Create TODO notes for:

* `IER-identity.md`: persistence across interruption
* `IER-ethics.md`: coma, death, moral terminality
* `IER-memory.md`: reachability vs unity
* `IER-futures.md`: admissible futures
* `IER-topology.md`: reconciliation of all of the above
