### **v10.8.5 — Rubric hardening (what your 10.8.4-plan-1 is trying to do)**

Your **v10.8.4-plan-1** is *good*, but it’s currently **mixing rubric packaging with new phenomenon coverage** (fringe/TOT, dreaming proof, amnesia, specious present, infants). That’s exactly the kind of “expand Part II dramatically” pressure you said you want to avoid right now.

So: keep the rubric release **purely evaluation-facing**.

**Keep in the rubric release (T3/T4, evaluation-facing):**

* **D1 `IER-explanandum.md`** (T4)
* **D5 `IER-identity-conditions.md`** (T3)
* **D8 `IER-falsifiability.md`** (T3)
* **D9 `IER-contrast-matrix.md`** (T2 appendix *or* folded into `IER-contrast.md` as an appendix)
* **AI clarification** only insofar as it is *misuse-blocking / “no certification”* (could be an appendix to `IER-slack.md`)

**Move out of the rubric release (because it’s Part II phenomena coverage):**

* D2 `IER-fringe.md`
* D3 dreaming proof (belongs in `IER-sleep.md`)
* D4 `IER-amnesia.md`
* D6 specious present/flow (belongs in `IER-continuity.md`)
* D7 ownership map (better as a section inside `IER-agency.md` / `IER-access.md`)
* D10 infants (belongs with diachronic / development)
  These are all excellent—but they’re **content-domain additions**, not rubric scaffolding.

This separation keeps your roadmap logic coherent and prevents the “rubric release” from becoming a second Part II expansion.

## **V. Optional Standalone Explanatory Articles (Non-Required)**

These are **audience-management tools only**.

They introduce no theory and are not required for closure.

* [ ] **`IER-regimes.md`**

  * Regime vs. description
  * Why regime talk does not imply modeling-level equivalence

* [ ] **`IER-and-engineering.md`**

  * What IER does *not* license in AI or systems engineering
  * Why “build-and-test” intuitions fail structurally

Failure to complete these documents does **not** indicate unfinished theory.
