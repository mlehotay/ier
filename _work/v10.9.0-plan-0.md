## **I. Navigation & Orientation Tasks**

These tasks improve **access, entry, and usability only**.

They do not add explanation, interpretation, or emphasis.

* [ ] `IER-glossary.md`
  Canon-constrained definitions; blocks imported meanings.

* [ ] `IER-index.md`
  Concept-to-location navigation only; no summaries or reinterpretation.

* [ ] **Cross-link glossary entries to first canonical usage**

  * Each term links to its first authoritative introduction.
  * No added exposition or paraphrase permitted.

* [ ] **Audit README reading paths**

  * Remove redundancy, loops, or dead ends.
  * Ensure all suggested paths terminate in closed Tier-1 material.

* [ ] **Add minimal “where to go next” pointers**

  * Target audiences: philosophy, neuroscience, ethics, AI.
  * Descriptive only; no endorsement or interpretive steering.

---

## **III. Misuse & Misreading Containment (Mandatory)**

These tasks preserve **long-term stability** of interpretation.

* [ ] **Scan Tier-2 documents for diagnostic or proxy language**

  * Eliminate phrasing that could be read as:

    * thresholds
    * indicators
    * sufficient conditions
    * measurable correlates

* [ ] **Verify informational-language disclaimers**

  * Every document using informational terms must include the required disclaimer.

* [ ] **Audit phenomenology-adjacent documents**

  * Ensure no implication of graded subjecthood, partial experience, or liminal standing.

* [ ] **Reinforce “experiential structure ≠ epistemic authority”**

  * Required in meaning-, insight-, agency-, narrative-, and belief-adjacent texts.

---

## **VI. Consistency & Drift Audits (Ongoing, Non-Blocking)**

Maintenance only.

* [ ] Tier-1 / Tier-2 language consistency checks
* [ ] Ethics language audit against v10.8 closure
* [ ] Reader-alignment tone audit
* [ ] Verification that non-canonical documents are not cited as authority

### Prime Rule

> If a task could make you stop and think about theory, it’s postponed.
> If a task can be done while slightly dissociated, it goes first.

## Phase 0 — Drop Into Motion (Typography First, As You Noted)

You were exactly right: typography is the easiest *because it’s already externalized to the linter*.

### Do this first (single session, short):

**Task:**
* [ ] Replace Unicode mathematical glyphs with LaTeX
* [ ] Enforce math/prose separation
* [ ] Normalize conceptual labels inside math

**Why this works:**

* Binary success/failure
* No semantic judgment
* The tool yells at you instead of your conscience
* You can stop at any time without leaving conceptual loose ends

**Rule while doing it:**

> Do not fix anything the linter does not complain about.

That constraint alone will keep you out of the basin.

Stop when tired. Even 20% completion counts. This phase exists only to prove movement is possible.

## Phase 1 — Inventory, Not Expansion (Glossary & Index)

Here’s the trap you must avoid:

> *“Expand the glossary.”*
> That sounds creative. It’s not allowed yet.

### Reframe both tasks as **extraction only**

#### Step 1: Glossary Skeleton (Non-Creative)

Instead of “expand `IER-glossary.md`”:

**Do this:**

* Grep the corpus for **bolded defined terms** and **capitalized constructs**
* Paste them into the glossary as **empty stubs** or one-line pointers

No prose. No refinement. Just:

```
**Intrinsic Constraint** — See `IER-specification.md`, §II
```

That’s it.

You are *mapping*, not explaining.

#### Step 2: Index as a Mechanical Mirror

Index work is even safer:

* For each glossary term, list **document + section only**
* No summaries
* No hierarchy debates

Think of the index as a **reverse table of contents**, not a concept map.

If you feel the urge to explain, you’ve gone too far.

---

## Phase 2 — Authority & Drift Audits (Purely Negative Work)

These are *deletion and verification tasks*, which are psychologically much easier than additive ones.

### Start with the safest checks:

* [ ] Verify no non-canonical document is cited as authority
* [ ] Tier consistency checks

These are yes/no questions:

* Is this cited?
* Is it allowed?

No rewriting unless something is *flatly illegal* under the canon.

If it’s ambiguous but survivable, **leave it**. Drift audits are “ongoing” for a reason.

---

## Phase 3 — Reader Alignment (Last, and Only Lightly)

This is the most basin-deepening category, so we constrain it heavily.

**Hard rule:**

> You are allowed to *remove* confusing tone.
> You are not allowed to *improve* clarity.

That means:

* soften sharp phrasing
* remove accidental adversarial tone
* **no new guidance**, no new framing brilliance

Think sanding, not sculpting.

## A Practical Daily Rule (This Helps More Than You’d Expect)

When you sit down, ask only this:

> **“Which task can I do that cannot accidentally produce new theory?”**

If the answer is “none,” you stop. That’s success, not failure.
