# **Audit: `IER-memory.md` Against Its Explanatory Orientation**

## **Overall Verdict: REVISE (but much closer than Time)**

This article is **theoretically strong**, but it **over-answers** its projection question and performs **identity and history synthesis locally**, which the interface forbids.

Crucially:
👉 **The Orientation itself is sound and should be frozen.**
All issues are **implementation-level**.

---

## **A. Orientation Integrity**

### **A1. Question Ownership — ⚠️ PARTIAL FAIL**

**Orientation claim:**

> *What remains reachable?*

**Article behavior:**

* Correctly explains reachability, re-entry, reproduction, and participation.
* **But also answers**:

  * *Who is bearing this?* (Identity)
  * *Why is the system shaped this way?* (History)
  * *What matters ethically?* (implicit standing language)

**Examples of overreach**

* §6 “Memory Is Not Identity”
* §6.2 “Diachronic Identity Is Not Memory-Based”
* Multiple passages asserting subject persistence, standing, replacement, etc.

**Diagnosis**
Memory is correctly explained — but the article also **pre-resolves identity disputes**, which is forbidden.

**Required fix**

* Memory may **refuse identity-based theories**, but must **not explain identity itself**.

---

### **A2. Foregrounded Aspect of Constraint — ✅ PASS**

Foregrounded aspect:

* **Reachability / re-entry** ✔️

This remains stable throughout:

* attractors
* reproduction
* participation
* basin viability
* constraint reshaping

No competing constraint aspects dominate.

---

### **A3. Fixed Structure — ⚠️ MINOR DRIFT**

Orientation invariants:

* no stored content ✔️
* irreversibility ✔️
* admissibility bound to system ✔️

**Drift**

* The article occasionally treats:

  * system persistence,
  * regime persistence,
  * subject persistence
    as background invariants.

Those belong to **Identity**, not Memory.

**Required fix**

* Reframe persistence claims as **presupposed elsewhere**, not established here.

---

### **A4. Allowed Variation — ✅ PASS**

Variation stays largely internal:

* accessibility
* participation
* pruning
* attractor stability

This is one of the strongest parts of the article.

---

## **B. Projection Isolation (Leakage Tests)**

### **B2 Memory Leakage — ✅ PASS**

No storage, no traces, no records. Excellent.

---

### **B3 Identity Leakage — ❌ FAIL**

Clear violations:

* §6 “Memory Is Not Identity”
* §6.2 “Diachronic Identity Is Not Memory-Based”
* Claims about subject persistence, replacement, standing

These **answer Identity’s question**, not merely refuse memory-based identity.

**Rule reminder**
Memory may say:

> “Memory does not constitute identity.”

Memory may not say:

> “Identity is constituted by X instead.”

---

### **B5 History Leakage — ⚠️ BORDERLINE**

* Sedimentation and hysteresis are used heavily.
* That is acceptable **only as background substrate**, not as explanatory focus.

**Drift occurs when**

* “Why the system is shaped this way” is answered *inside* Memory rather than deferred.

---

### **Ethics Leakage (implicit but real) — ❌ FAIL**

Even though Ethics isn’t one of the six projections, the interface still forbids it here.

Examples:

* “diminished standing”
* “replacement or death”
* “subject loss”

These are **normative implications**, not memory structure.

---

## **C. Topology Discipline**

### **C1 No Local Synthesis — ❌ FAIL**

The article repeatedly does the following:

> Memory doesn’t do X, therefore identity must be Y.

That is **local reconciliation**, which must occur only in `IER-topology.md`.

### **C2 Deferral Clause — ❌ MISSING**

The mandatory deferral sentence **does not appear at the end of the article body**.

It must appear **in the projection article itself**, not only in the Orientation block you supplied externally.

---

# **Summary of What’s Going Wrong (Conceptually)**

The article is doing **too good a job**.

It:

* explains memory correctly,
* anticipates misreadings,
* and then **preemptively solves identity and ethical confusions**.

Under the interface, that helpfulness is **a scope error**.

---

# **Plan to Bring `IER-memory.md` Into Compliance**

## **Phase 0 — Insert Orientation**

* Insert the **Explanatory Orientation (Memory)** verbatim after the title.
* Freeze it.

---

## **Phase 1 — Contain Identity Without Explaining It**

### **Target: Section 6 (“Memory Is Not Identity”)**

**Current state**

* Explains subject persistence and standing.

**Required change**

* Replace the entire section with a **pure refusal**, e.g.:

> Memory does not determine subjecthood, persistence, or standing.
> Questions of identity are handled exclusively in `IER-identity.md`.

No explanation of what identity *is*.

---

## **Phase 2 — Convert History Explanations to Background Presuppositions**

### **Sections affected**

* §2.1 Sedimentation
* §2.2 Hysteresis
* §7.3 Structural History

**Action**

* Keep them **only as enabling background**.
* Remove any “therefore” claims about why the system is shaped as it is.
* Add explicit language:

  > These mechanisms are explained fully in `IER-sedimentation.md`.

---

## **Phase 3 — Remove Ethical and Standing Language**

Delete or rephrase:

* “standing”
* “replacement”
* “death”
* “diminished”
* any normative implication

Memory can say:

> “Loss of recall does not imply X.”

Memory cannot say:

> “Therefore X is ethically irrelevant / preserved / central.”

---

## **Phase 4 — Tighten the Conclusion**

The final summary currently synthesizes:

* memory,
* identity,
* epistemology.

Revise it so it answers **only**:

> What remains reachable, and why reachability can change without storage.

---

## **Phase 5 — Add Mandatory Deferral Clause**

Add at the very end:

> **Unification with other constraint projections is handled exclusively in `IER-topology.md`.**

No synthesis after it.

---

# **Bottom Line**

* **Orientation: PASS**
* **Core memory theory: STRONG**
* **Interface compliance: NOT YET**

This is a **containment edit**, not a conceptual one.
