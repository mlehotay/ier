## Audit: `IER-futures.md` against its Explanatory Orientation (Possibility)

### Overall verdict: **REVISE (conceptually strong, but interface-violating in scope)**

This article is **the most ambitious** of the projection set, and it shows.
While the Orientation itself is sound, the implementation **systematically exceeds the Possibility projection’s mandate** by:

* performing **local synthesis across multiple projections**,
* re-explaining Memory, Identity, Continuity, Agency, and Ethics from within Possibility,
* and introducing a **dual-view framework** that belongs in `IER-topology.md`, not in a single projection article.

This is not a failure of theory.
It is a **failure of isolation discipline**.

## 1) Orientation contract check

### A1. Question ownership — **FAIL (over-answering)**

**Orientation question:**

> **What could still occur?**

**Article behavior:**
The article does answer this question — but it also answers, in the same file:

* **Who is bearing this?** (identity persistence language)
* **What remains reachable?** (memory and forgetting as future viability)
* **What is happening now?** (continuity across gaps)
* **Is this resolution owned?** (agency and moral harm framing)
* **Why is the system shaped this way?** (sedimentation recap)

This is explicit in:

* §1 (motivating all other projections),
* §4 (continuity, identity),
* §4.3 (memory),
* §6–§7 (moral harm, standing),
* §8 (mapping explanatory dependencies).

**Diagnosis:**
The article treats Possibility as a **unifying hub** rather than a **single projection**.

That directly violates the interface.

---

### A2. Foregrounded aspect of constraint — **PASS (but diluted)**

Foregrounded aspect:

> **topological openness**

This is present — but it is **not kept foregrounded**. It competes with:

* experiential continuity,
* identity persistence,
* memory reachability,
* moral harm.

Possibility should describe **structure of admissible continuations**, not how that structure is *used* by other projections.

---

### A3. Fixed structure — **PASS**

The invariants are respected:

* current intrinsic constraint ✔️
* physical law ✔️
* system boundary ✔️

No contradictions here.

---

### A4. Allowed variation — **PASS**

Variation stays within admissible-future structure *when considered alone*.
The problem is not what varies, but **what explanatory work is done with it**.

---

### A5. Non-claims — **FAIL (violated in practice)**

Orientation non-claims include:

* no probability
* no imagined alternatives
* no optimization
* no modal realism

While these are verbally rejected, the article **does introduce other forbidden claims** for Possibility:

* identity continuity explanations,
* memory explanation,
* ethical harm interpretation,
* two-view metaphysics.

These are not Possibility’s non-claims but are **interface-level prohibitions**.

---

### A6. Mandatory deferral clause — **VIOLATED IN PRACTICE**

Although the clause appears in the Orientation, the article **does the opposite**:

> It explicitly unifies projections *inside the article* instead of deferring to `IER-topology.md`.

The following are all **local synthesis**:

* “one structure, two explanatory views”
* “supports identity, memory, agency, moral harm”
* mapping which documents use which “view”

That synthesis must occur **only** in `IER-topology.md`.

---

## 2) Projection isolation failures (Appendix B)

### B1 Time leakage — **FAIL**

Explains:

* continuity across unconscious gaps,
* “forward-structured continuity,”
* regime persistence.

That is Time + Identity.

---

### B2 Memory leakage — **FAIL**

§4.3 explicitly explains:

* memory,
* forgetting,
* future accessibility.

That is Memory’s projection, not Possibility’s.

---

### B3 Identity leakage — **FAIL**

Identity persistence and “what the subject can still become” is explained repeatedly.

Possibility may describe **structure of continuations**, but not **who persists across them**.

---

### B4 Agency leakage — **FAIL**

Use of:

* “owned resolution,”
* “agency concerns owned resolution of alternatives,”
* collapse language tied to subject perspective.

Agency may *use* futures, but Possibility must not explain agency.

---

### B5 History leakage — **FAIL**

Sedimentation and path dependence are re-explained instead of presupposed.

---

### B6 Ethics leakage — **FAIL**

§6–§7 explicitly explain:

* moral harm,
* standing,
* why futures are not moral currency.

This is **IER-ethics.md** territory.

---

## 3) Core methodological problem (important)

This file is doing what **IER-topology.md** is supposed to do.

Specifically, it:

* introduces a **unifying explanatory schema** (“one structure, two views”),
* shows how that schema supports multiple projections,
* maps the corpus accordingly.

That is **topology**, not Possibility.

The Orientation itself explicitly forbids this.

---

## 4) What to do with `IER-futures.md` (clear plan)

### Phase 0 — Freeze the Orientation

The Orientation is **correct**. Do not weaken it to fit the article.

---

### Phase 1 — Decide the role of this file

You have two clean options. Only one is interface-compliant.

#### ❌ Option A (do NOT do this)

Keep `IER-futures.md` as a unifying explanation of futures across projections.

→ This violates the interface by design.

#### ✅ Option B (recommended)

**Narrow `IER-futures.md` to a pure Possibility projection** and move synthesis elsewhere.

---

### Phase 2 — Scope-correct `IER-futures.md` (Possibility-only)

#### KEEP (with light edits)

* Core definition of admissible futures (§2.1)
* Structural/dynamical description (§3.1–§3.3)
* Topological openness, branching, contraction/expansion
* Rejections of probability, optimization, modal realism

#### DELETE or RELOCATE

Move the following to `IER-topology.md` (or relevant projections):

* “one structure, two explanatory views”
* experiential “inside” description
* continuity across gaps
* memory and forgetting (§4.3)
* identity persistence language
* agency framing
* moral harm (§6–§7)
* corpus-mapping (§8)

Possibility must **not explain how futures matter** — only **what futures are**.

---

### Phase 3 — Rewrite the conclusion (Possibility-only)

A compliant conclusion would say something like:

> Under IER, admissible futures are the physically permitted continuations of a system’s intrinsic constraint organization.
> Their structure may expand, contract, or collapse under lawful dynamics.
> This article makes no claims about how these futures are experienced, owned, remembered, or valued.

---

### Phase 4 — Add deferral clause at end

Verbatim:

> **Unification with other constraint projections is handled exclusively in `IER-topology.md`.**

And ensure **no synthesis appears after it**.

---

## 5) Bottom line

* **Orientation:** PASS
* **Theory quality:** HIGH
* **Interface compliance:** FAIL (scope explosion)

This file is *excellent topology material* disguised as a projection article.

Once you strip it back to **pure Possibility**, the rest of what you’ve written does not get lost — it simply gets **put where the interface says it belongs**.
