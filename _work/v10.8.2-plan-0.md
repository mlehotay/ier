## **VII. Tier Assignment Corrections (Mandatory, Structural Only)**

These changes correct **labeling**, not authority.

### **A) `IER-math.md`**

* Reclassify from **[T1] → [T2]**

### **B) `IER-ethics.md`**

* Reclassify from **[T1] → [T2]**

Document placement is stylistic; tier labeling is binding.
