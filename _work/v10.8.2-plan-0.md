## **VII. Tier Assignment Corrections (Mandatory, Structural Only)**

These changes correct **labeling**, not authority.

### **A) `IER-math.md`**

* Reclassify from **[T1] → [T2]**

### **B) `IER-ethics.md`**

* Reclassify from **[T1] → [T2]**

Document placement is stylistic; tier labeling is binding.

---

## **VIII. Tooling / Meta (Optional)**

Convenience only.

* [ ] Machine-readable manifest or index
* [ ] Lightweight linting rules for:

  * agentive language in definitions
  * missing informational disclaimers
  * forbidden diagnostic phrasing
* [ ] Automated tier-violation checks

---

## **XII. Mathematical Notation & Glyph Hygiene (Mandatory, Corpus-Wide)**

* [ ] **Replace all Unicode mathematical glyphs with LaTeX notation**

  Perform a **full-corpus audit** to eliminate all Unicode math symbols and replace them with their canonical LaTeX equivalents, in accordance with `IER-canon.md` typography rules.

  This includes (non-exhaustive):

  * Unicode operators: `≠`, `≈`, `≤`, `≥`, `→`, `⇒`, `↦`, `⊂`, `⊆`, `∈`, `∉`, `∅`, `∑`, `∫`, `∆`
  * Unicode arrows, relations, and set symbols
  * Unicode superscripts, subscripts, primes, or decorated variables
  * Mixed Unicode / ASCII mathematical expressions

  All such symbols must be replaced with:

  * LaTeX math mode equivalents (e.g. `\neq`, `\Rightarrow`, `\subseteq`, `\in`)
  * Proper use of `$...$` or `$$...$$` as required by scope and structure

---

* [ ] **Enforce strict separation between math mode and prose**

  Verify corpus-wide that:

  * Mathematical expressions appear **only** in LaTeX math mode
  * Sentence punctuation appears **outside** math mode
  * Backticks are **never** used for mathematics
  * Math mode is not used for emphasis, metaphor, or informal shorthand

---

* [ ] **Normalize conceptual labels inside math expressions**

  Ensure that:

  * Conceptual terms inside math mode are wrapped in `\text{...}`
  * Subscripts use `_` with `\text{...}` for conceptual labels
  * Genuine variables, functions, and operators are **not** wrapped in `\text{}`

  Example (canonical form):

  ```
  $I_{\text{intrinsic}}(t) \neq I_{\text{external}}(t)$
  ```

---

* [ ] **Audit display math vs inline math usage**

  Confirm that:

  * Governing relations and multi-line expressions use display math (`$$...$$`)
  * Inline math is used only for short expressions embedded in prose
  * No display math appears mid-sentence or mid-paragraph

---

* [ ] **Verify renderer-independence and copy stability**

  Ensure that all mathematical notation:

  * renders correctly in Markdown, Pandoc, PDF, EPUB, and HTML outputs
  * survives copy-paste without glyph corruption
  * does not depend on font-specific Unicode symbols

  The goal is **semantic stability**, not aesthetic optimization.

---

* [ ] **Confirm canon compliance**

  Verify that all mathematical notation conforms to the **Typography and Notation** rules in `IER-canon.md`, and that no document introduces:

  * informal symbol variants
  * personal shorthand
  * nonstandard operators
  * visually suggestive but semantically ambiguous glyphs

---

### **Stopping Condition**

This task is complete when:

* no Unicode mathematical glyphs remain anywhere in the corpus
* all mathematical content is expressed in LaTeX
* notation is consistent across Tier-1 through Tier-4 documents
* builds render identically across supported output formats

This task introduces **no new mathematics** and **no new commitments**.
It is a **pure representational hygiene requirement**.
