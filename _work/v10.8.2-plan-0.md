## **VII. Tier Assignment Corrections (Mandatory, Structural Only)**

These changes correct **labeling**, not authority.

### **A) `IER-math.md`**

* Reclassify from **[T1] → [T2]**

### **B) `IER-ethics.md`**

* Reclassify from **[T1] → [T2]**

Document placement is stylistic; tier labeling is binding.

* [ ] **Confirm canon compliance**

  Verify that all mathematical notation conforms to the **Typography and Notation** rules in `IER-canon.md`, and that no document introduces:

  * informal symbol variants
  * personal shorthand
  * nonstandard operators
  * visually suggestive but semantically ambiguous glyphs
