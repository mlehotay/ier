# v10.8.3-plan-3.md

**Rubric-coverage implementation plan (commitment-preserving)**
**Target version:** v10.8.3 (PATCH)
**Constraint:** *No new primitives, no new criteria/thresholds/diagnostics, no graded subjecthood, no softening of non-diagnosability, no new ethical rules.* All additions must be **expository / consolidative / translational** only, and canon-aligned.

---

## 0. Goal and Success Condition

### Goal

Raise “rubric coverage” to ~100% **without changing IER’s commitments**, by adding (or consolidating) *explicit articulations* that evaluators expect to see in one place.

### Success condition

A reader can take the checklist and find an explicit IER statement for every item, where each statement:

1. is **consistent with** `IER-specification.md`
2. introduces **no criteria, diagnostics, thresholds, or graded standing**
3. uses the required **disclaimers** (informational language is derivative; no epistemic authority)
4. makes any “testability” talk explicitly **identity-level**, not “consciousness detection”

## 1. Deliverables Overview (New Documents)

### D1 — `IER-explanandum.md`

**Tier:** T4 (Orientation)
**Purpose:** Explicit matrix of what IER explains vs excludes.

**Contents (required):**

* Explanandum matrix:

  * phenomenal consciousness: **YES (core)**
  * access consciousness: **NO (non-criterial; may co-occur)**
  * reportability: **NO**
  * self-awareness: **derived / optional**
* Level-of-description map:

  * IER as **physicalist identity theory** + **regime-level** description
* Domain applicability: humans/animals/AI/physical systems (with the “strictness” framing)
* Explicit exclusions: diagnostics, meters, behavioral tests, graded subjecthood

**Acceptance criteria:**

* Includes a “what this document does not do” section.
* Contains **no new necessary/sufficient conditions** beyond those in the Specification.

---

### D5 — `IER-identity-conditions.md`

**Tier:** T3 (Misuse-blocking / clarity) **or** T2 (if kept purely expository)
**Purpose:** Reframe “NCC” demands into IER’s “physical identity conditions,” without implying detectability.

**Contents (required):**

* Terminology bridge:

  * “correlates” (standard usage) vs “identity conditions” (IER)
* Explicit clause:

  * experience is neither epiphenomenal nor downstream (identity)
* Clarify:

  * IER specifies **what matters physically**
  * IER does *not* license **how to find it externally**
* One section: “Compatible with neuroscience; not a neuroscience theory”

**Acceptance criteria:**

* Must include “Identity is not a detection rule.”
* Must include “diagnostics are structurally impossible” pointer.

---

### D8 — `IER-falsifiability.md`

**Tier:** T3
**Purpose:** “Testability without diagnostics” clarification.

**Contents (required):**

* What would count as falsifying IER:

  * coherent contradictions to identity conditions (conceptual / structural)
  * demonstration of experience in slack-admitting systems **on IER’s own definitions** (i.e., showing the definition is inconsistent)
* What would not:

  * failures of behavioral tests
  * disagreements about correlates
* Why “no diagnostics” is not “not falsifiable” (identity-theory framing)

**Acceptance criteria:**

* Must include a section titled “Not a consciousness test.”
* Must include the underdetermination argument pointer.

---

### D9 — `IER-contrast-matrix.md` (or Appendix to `IER-contrast.md`)

**Tier:** T2
**Purpose:** A rubric-facing comparison matrix with major theories.

**Contents (required):**

* IIT, GNW, Predictive Processing, Panpsychism (and optionally Higher-Order Thought)
* Columns aligned to rubric headers (framing, phenomenology, diagnostics, AI, etc.)
* Notes emphasize incommensurability where relevant

**Acceptance criteria:**

* Must not strawman rivals; must keep it descriptive.
* Must include “IER forbids diagnostics in principle” as a differentiator.

---

### D11 — `IER-ai-proof-expanded.md` (or Appendix to `IER-slack.md`)

**Tier:** T2
**Purpose:** Expanded “AI likely slack-admitting” structural argument.

**Contents (required):**

* Why common AI architectures (modularity, buffering, external orchestration) typically imply slack
* Therefore: structural preclusion under IER
* Explicit caveat: does not certify non-experience for any particular system

**Acceptance criteria:**

* Must include “No certification” language.
* Must avoid implementation guidance (no “how to build conscious AI”).

---

## 2. Modifications to Existing Documents

### M1 — `IER-manifest.md`

Add new documents in correct Part II / Part III sections with tiers:

* T4: `IER-explanandum.md`
* T2: `IER-ai-proof-expanded.md`, (and any appendices)
* T3: `IER-identity-conditions.md`, `IER-falsifiability.md`
* T2 appendix: `IER-contrast-matrix.md` (or attach to existing `IER-contrast.md`)

**Acceptance criteria:** manifest ordering remains coherent; tier assignments consistent with canon roles.

---

## 3. Canon and Alignment Guardrails

### G1 — No new commitments checklist (must pass for every new/edited doc)

* No new primitives beyond: physical systems, intrinsic constraint, dynamical regimes
* No thresholds, no metrics, no “likely conscious if…”
* No graded subjecthood
* No experiential diagnostics / tests / certification pathways
* Informational-language disclaimer present
* Reaffirm epistemic non-authority where meaning/insight/salience appear

### G2 — Placement discipline

* Anything that reads like “misuse-blocking” goes T3.
* Pure translation/orientation goes T4.
* Phenomenology/edge cases/examples go T2.

## 4. Work Sequence

1. **Create orientation/translation scaffolding:** D1
4. **Rubric pain points (NCC/testability):** D5, D8
5. **Comparative matrix:** D9
6. **AI expansion:** D11
7. Update `IER-manifest.md` M1
8. Final canon sweep: ensure every doc includes required disclaimers and doesn’t accidentally imply diagnostics.

---

## 5. Definition of Done

IER v10.8.3 is “rubric-complete” when:

* Every checklist item has a **direct pointer** to a heading in the corpus.
* The project still truthfully says:

  * experience is **identity** with UEF operation
  * subjecthood is **categorical**
  * diagnostics are **structurally impossible**
* New material is clearly labeled as:

  * translation, consolidation, or rubric-facing articulation
  * not new theory, not new criteria, not new methods
