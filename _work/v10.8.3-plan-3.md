# v10.8.3-plan-3.md

### D9 — `IER-contrast-matrix.md` (or Appendix to `IER-contrast.md`)

**Tier:** T2
**Purpose:** A rubric-facing comparison matrix with major theories.

**Contents (required):**

* IIT, GNW, Predictive Processing, Panpsychism (and optionally Higher-Order Thought)
* Columns aligned to rubric headers (framing, phenomenology, diagnostics, AI, etc.)
* Notes emphasize incommensurability where relevant

**Acceptance criteria:**

* Must not strawman rivals; must keep it descriptive.
* Must include “IER forbids diagnostics in principle” as a differentiator.

## 2. Modifications to Existing Documents

### M1 — `IER-manifest.md`

Add new documents in correct Part II / Part III sections with tiers:

* T4: `IER-explanandum.md`
* T2: `IER-ai-proof-expanded.md`, (and any appendices)
* T3: `IER-identity-conditions.md`, `IER-falsifiability.md`
* T2 appendix: `IER-contrast-matrix.md` (or attach to existing `IER-contrast.md`)

**Acceptance criteria:** manifest ordering remains coherent; tier assignments consistent with canon roles.

## 3. Canon and Alignment Guardrails

### G1 — No new commitments checklist (must pass for every new/edited doc)

* No new primitives beyond: physical systems, intrinsic constraint, dynamical regimes
* No thresholds, no metrics, no “likely conscious if…”
* No graded subjecthood
* No experiential diagnostics / tests / certification pathways
* Informational-language disclaimer present
* Reaffirm epistemic non-authority where meaning/insight/salience appear

### G2 — Placement discipline

* Anything that reads like “misuse-blocking” goes T3.
* Pure translation/orientation goes T4.
* Phenomenology/edge cases/examples go T2.

## 4. Work Sequence

5. **Comparative matrix:** D9
7. Update `IER-manifest.md` M1
8. Final canon sweep: ensure every doc includes required disclaimers and doesn’t accidentally imply diagnostics.

## 5. Definition of Done

IER v10.8.3 is “rubric-complete” when:

* Every checklist item has a **direct pointer** to a heading in the corpus.
* The project still truthfully says:

  * experience is **identity** with UEF operation
  * subjecthood is **categorical**
  * diagnostics are **structurally impossible**
* New material is clearly labeled as:

  * translation, consolidation, or rubric-facing articulation
  * not new theory, not new criteria, not new methods
