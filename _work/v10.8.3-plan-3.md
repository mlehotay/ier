## 3. Canon and Alignment Guardrails

### G1 — No new commitments checklist (must pass for every new/edited doc)

* No new primitives beyond: physical systems, intrinsic constraint, dynamical regimes
* No thresholds, no metrics, no “likely conscious if…”
* No graded subjecthood
* No experiential diagnostics / tests / certification pathways
* Informational-language disclaimer present
* Reaffirm epistemic non-authority where meaning/insight/salience appear

### G2 — Placement discipline

* Anything that reads like “misuse-blocking” goes T3.
* Pure translation/orientation goes T4.
* Phenomenology/edge cases/examples go T2.

## 5. Definition of Done

IER v10.8.3 is “rubric-complete” when:

* Every checklist item has a **direct pointer** to a heading in the corpus.
* The project still truthfully says:

  * experience is **identity** with UEF operation
  * subjecthood is **categorical**
  * diagnostics are **structurally impossible**
* New material is clearly labeled as:

  * translation, consolidation, or rubric-facing articulation
  * not new theory, not new criteria, not new methods
