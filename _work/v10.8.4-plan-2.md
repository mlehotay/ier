### D2 — `IER-fringe.md`

**Tier:** T2 (Elaboration)
**Purpose:** Consolidate partial/fringe awareness phenomena under **participation modulation**.

**Contents (required):**

* Definitions (non-normative): “fringe,” “peripheral,” “tip-of-the-tongue,” “background feelings”
* Structural account:

  * low participation ≠ partial subjecthood
  * fringe awareness = weak, unstable, or background participation under intact UEF
* Worked examples:

  * vague awareness of a sound
  * “something’s off” feeling
  * TOT (tip-of-the-tongue) pressure
* Explicit link-back to Principle: participation changes content, not subjecthood

**Acceptance criteria:**

* At least one boxed “Do not infer graded consciousness” warning.
* Explicitly distinguishes “limited access” from “non-experience.”

### D3 — `IER-dreaming-proof.md` (or add as appendix to `IER-sleep.md`)

**Tier:** T2
**Purpose:** A compact “why dreams are conscious” argument.

**Contents (required):**

* A short necessity argument:

  * Dreams are conscious **iff** a UEF persists (input independence)
* Clarify reduced insight / reduced agency in dreams as:

  * altered participation topology
  * different constraint organization
* Explicit rejection of: “dreams are conscious because they are reportable”

**Acceptance criteria:**

* Includes a clean “IFF” structure in prose (no new formalism required).
* Doesn’t propose any dream-state detection rule.

### D4 — `IER-amnesia.md`

**Tier:** T2
**Purpose:** Canonical “amnesia with preserved consciousness” case treatment.

**Contents (required):**

* Anterograde amnesia case walkthrough:

  * intact UEF → intact experience
  * memory formation failure → narrative discontinuity, not experiential absence
* Distinguish:

  * experiential continuity (regime) vs autobiographical continuity (memory)
* Map to: “temporal continuity” rubric items

**Acceptance criteria:**

* Includes one explicit “memory is not a criterion for experience” statement.
* Avoids neuroanatomical claims unless clearly labeled “illustrative only.”

### D6 — `IER-specious-present.md` (or add to `IER-continuity.md`)

**Tier:** T2
**Purpose:** Explicit handling of “specious present” and flow.

**Contents (required):**

* Specious present = minimal temporal window of coherent intrinsic constraint
* Flow = regime persistence across successive windows
* Not memory, not introspective sampling, not a moving snapshot

**Acceptance criteria:**

* Directly addresses the rubric terms “specious present” and “flow of experience.”
* No new claims about measurable window sizes.

### D7 — `IER-ownership-map.md` (could be a section inside `IER-agency.md` or `IER-access.md`)

**Tier:** T2
**Purpose:** Translation table from phenomenology to IER structure.

**Contents (required):**

* A mapping table:

  * mineness → ownership of intrinsic constraint
  * for-me-ness → non-externalizable burden in a UEF
  * self/ownership boundary → regime-relative system boundary
* Short examples:

  * ownership in pain
  * ownership in decision pressure
  * ownership disruption in dissociation

**Acceptance criteria:**

* Must explicitly say “This is a translation, not a reduction to reportability.”

### D10 — `IER-infants.md`

**Tier:** T2
**Purpose:** Infant/development coverage articulated in IER terms.

**Contents (required):**

* Preparatory variables accumulate continuously
* Onset remains categorical (regime transition)
* Strong caution: no neonatal/infant diagnostics implied
* Ethical note: precaution under uncertainty (scoped)

**Acceptance criteria:**

* No biological claims presented as criterial.
* Must preserve categorical onset.

---

### M2 — `IER-FAQ.md`

Add a short “Rubric quick answers” section linking to the new docs:

* “Do you explain qualia?” → spec + theory
* “Do you explain unconscious processing?” → fringe + slack + participation
* “Why no diagnostics?” → diagnostics + identity-conditions
* “What about AI/infants?” → infants + AI expanded

**Acceptance criteria:** still brief, still non-normative, no new claims.

---

### M3 — `IER-sleep.md` / `IER-continuity.md` / `IER-agency.md`

Optionally absorb D3/D6/D7 as appendices instead of new standalone docs (editor choice), but ensure:

* each rubric keyword has an explicit heading somewhere (“dreams,” “specious present,” “mineness”)

## 4. Work Sequence

1. **Create orientation/translation scaffolding:** D7
2. **Close rubric “phenomena consolidation” gaps:** D2, D4, D6
3. **Cover states & development:** D3, D10
7. Update `IER-manifest.md` + `IER-FAQ.md` (M1–M2)
