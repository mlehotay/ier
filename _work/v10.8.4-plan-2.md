# **v10.8.4-plan-2.md (Revised)**

**Remaining Diachronic Closure Work — Post-Integration**

---

## Status

This document is a **planning artifact only**.

It:

* introduces **no ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical commitments**
* authorizes **no revisions** to the IER Specification
* proposes **no diagnostics, mechanisms, or detection rules**
* does **not** imply that the listed work is mandatory for v10.8.4 completion

All binding authority remains fixed **exclusively** in the IER v10.8 canon.

---

## What Has Already Been Implemented Elsewhere

The following items from earlier drafts of this plan have been **fully absorbed** into existing v10.8.4 work and are **removed from this plan**:

* Infant / development framing → implemented in `IER-development.md`
* Specious present + flow → implemented in `IER-skill.md`
* Fringe / partial awareness (core structure + warning) → implemented in `IER-attention.md`

They no longer require standalone treatment for v10.8.4.

---

## Remaining Work Items

### D2 — `IER-fringe.md` *(Optional Standalone Consolidation)*

**Tier:** T2 (Elaboration)
**Status:** Optional / deferrable
**Rationale:** Core concepts already absorbed into `IER-attention.md`

**Purpose (if created):**
Provide a **single consolidation document** for fringe, peripheral, and background awareness phenomena, primarily for reader navigation and rubric satisfaction.

**Would Contain (only if written):**

* Non-normative definitions:

  * fringe awareness
  * peripheral awareness
  * tip-of-the-tongue pressure
  * background feelings
* Structural clarification:

  * low participation ≠ partial subjecthood
  * limited access ≠ non-experience
* Cross-references only (no new theory)

**Explicit Non-Goals:**

* No graded consciousness
* No access-based criteria
* No diagnostics

**Note:**
This document is **not required** for v10.8.4 if the absorption into `IER-attention.md` is judged sufficient.

---

### D3 — Dreaming Consciousness Argument

*(Appendix to `IER-sleep.md` or short standalone `IER-dreaming-proof.md`)*

**Tier:** T2
**Status:** Unimplemented

**Purpose:**
Provide a compact, explicit argument explaining **why dreams are conscious under IER**, without appealing to reportability, imagery, or introspection.

**Required Contents:**

* A short necessity-and-sufficiency argument in prose:

  * Dreams are conscious **iff** a Unified Experiential Field persists
* Clarification that:

  * reduced insight = altered participation topology
  * reduced agency ≠ loss of experience
* Explicit rejection of:

  * “dreams are conscious because they can be reported”

**Acceptance Constraints:**

* No dream-state detection rules
* No neural correlates
* No expansion of sleep taxonomy

---

### D7 — Ownership Translation Map

*(Section inside `IER-agency.md` or `IER-access.md`)*

**Tier:** T2
**Status:** Unimplemented

**Purpose:**
Provide a **phenomenology → structure translation table** to reduce reader confusion around ownership language.

**Required Contents:**

* A mapping table translating:

  * *mineness* → ownership of intrinsic constraint
  * *for-me-ness* → non-externalizable burden within a UEF
  * *self-boundary* → regime-relative system boundary
* Brief worked examples:

  * ownership in pain
  * ownership in decision pressure
  * ownership disruption in dissociation

**Mandatory Disclaimer:**

> *This is a translation for interpretive clarity, not a reduction to reportability, access, or introspection.*

**Explicit Non-Goals:**

* No endorsement of phenomenological method
* No diagnostics
* No authority inflation

---

### M2 — `IER-FAQ.md` (Rubric Pointers Only)

**Tier:** T4
**Status:** Unimplemented

**Purpose:**
Add a **very short “Rubric Quick Answers” subsection** pointing readers to the correct documents.

**Proposed Additions (links only):**

* “Do you explain qualia?” → `IER-specification.md`, `IER-theory.md`
* “Do you explain unconscious processing?” → `IER-attention.md`, `IER-slack.md`, `IER-participation.md`
* “Why no diagnostics?” → `IER-diagnostics.md`, identity conditions
* “What about infants / AI?” → `IER-development.md`, `IER-intelligence.md`

**Constraints:**

* No new explanations
* No new claims
* Must remain brief and non-normative

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope for v10.8.4

This plan does **not** include:

* new phenomenology domains
* new Tier-1 or Tier-3 documents
* neuroscience, biology, or correlates
* experience detection or certification
* graded or liminal subjecthood

Any work touching those areas must be deferred to a later version or rejected.

---

## Current Completion Status (Post-Integration)

After absorption into the four diachronic documents:

* Diachronic structure is **theoretically closed**
* Remaining items are **clarificatory, translational, or navigational**
* v10.8.4 can ship **without** completing this plan in full

---

## Orientation Signal

> **v10.8.4 no longer lacks structure.
> What remains is reader alignment, not theory.**
