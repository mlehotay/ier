# **IER — Release Roadmap**

## **Status**

This document is **non-canonical**, **non-authoritative**, and **non-binding**.

It:

* introduces **no ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical commitments**
* proposes **no revisions** to the IER Specification
* authorizes **no new claims, diagnostics, or methods**
* does **not** reopen normative closure

All binding authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

* `IER-specification.md`
* governed by `IER-canon.md`

If any conflict arises, **canonical documents take precedence and this document is void**.

---

## **Purpose**

`IER-roadmap.md` defines the **intended sequencing and scope discipline** for future IER releases **after normative closure (v10.8)**.

It exists to:

1. Map **which kinds of work belong in which versions**
2. Prevent **scope creep across patch releases**
3. Separate **architectural change** from **cleanup and polish**
4. Provide a psychologically and structurally finite release ladder

This document is **not**:

* a list of tasks
* a substitute for `IER-future-work.md`
* a theory roadmap
* a promise of future features

`IER-future-work.md` remains the **authoritative inventory of permissible work**.
This document specifies **when and how subsets of that work should be released**.

---

# **Release Roadmap**

## **Versioning Principle (Reaffirmed)**

> **IER patch versions track changes in articulation and structure, not expansion of authority.**

All releases below preserve:

* the IER identity claim
* categorical subjecthood
* non-diagnosability
* closed ethical commitments
* canon authority structure

No listed release reopens normative closure.

---

## **v10.8.5 — Freeze, Canon Lock, and Baseline Stabilization**

**Intent:**

> *Establish a stable, pre-hexad baseline.*

This release **does not introduce new architecture**.
It exists to ensure that the corpus entering the hexad phase is **internally consistent, readable, and frozen**.

### **Includes**

#### **A. Mechanical & Editorial Cleanup**

* Formatting, LaTeX, and glyph hygiene
* Minor clarity edits (no semantic change)
* Typographical corrections
* Cross-reference consistency

#### **B. Navigation & Orientation Polish**

* Glossary and index refinement
* Reading-path cleanup
* README and entry-point alignment
* Minimal audience-specific pointers

#### **C. Misuse & Misreading Containment (Non-Structural)**

* Diagnostic / proxy language sweep (Tier-2 only)
* Informational-language disclaimer verification
* Reinforcement: *experiential structure ≠ epistemic authority*
* No new interface rules or enforcement mechanisms

### **Explicit Exclusions**

* No new documents
* No projection discipline
* No refactors
* No audits
* No scope reclassification

**Outcome:**
A clean, locked **pre-hexad corpus** suitable for architectural overlay.

---

## **v10.9.0 — Hexad & Projection Architecture (Structural Declaration)**

**Intent:**

> *Make explicit the projection architecture already implicit in IER.*

This release introduces **no new theory**.
It introduces **explicit structure about how existing theory is organized and interpreted**.

### **Core Additions**

* `IER-hexad.md`
  *Reader-facing map of the six explanatory projections*

* `IER-interface.md`
  *Internal projection-discipline and isolation rules*

* Mandatory **Explanatory Orientation** sections (added, not enforced)

* Explicit designation of `IER-topology.md` as **keystone synthesis**

### **Critical Scope Rule**

> **This release declares architecture; it does not enforce compliance.**

Projection articles:

* may fail audits
* may contain legacy leakage
* are not required to be refactored

Audits are **diagnostic only**.

### **Explicit Non-Goals**

* No projection rewrites
* No material relocation
* No deletions of legacy prose
* No narrowing of existing explanations

**Outcome:**
IER becomes **self-aware of its projection structure**, without destabilizing content.

---

## **v10.9.1+ — Projection Refactor Passes (Optional, Staged)**

**Intent:**

> *Align legacy projection articles with the declared architecture, incrementally and without urgency.*

These are **optional, future releases**, not commitments.

### **Permitted Work**

* One projection at a time
* Interface-compliant refactors
* Relocation (not loss) of material
* Creation of:

  * Topology-only synthesis
  * Projection-pure anchors
  * Cross-projection “consequence” documents

### **Explicit Constraints**

* No new theory
* No new authority
* No change to ethical closure
* No requirement that all projections be refactored

**Outcome:**
Structural cleanliness improves **without sacrificing prior insight**.

---

## **v10.10 — Explicitly Not Planned**

A bump to **v10.10** is **not authorized** under this roadmap.

It would be justified **only if**:

* identity conditions change
* necessary or sufficient conditions change
* ethical consequences change
* epistemic limits are altered
* normative closure is reopened

No currently anticipated work meets these criteria.

---

## **Global Guardrail**

> **If a proposed addition does not prevent a concrete misreading or resolve a structural ambiguity, it must not be released.**

IER advances by **constraint**, not accumulation.

---

## **Relationship to `IER-future-work.md`**

* `IER-future-work.md`
  → **What** work is permitted (exhaustive, authoritative checklist)

* `IER-roadmap.md`
  → **When and how** subsets of that work are released

The checklist governs scope.
The roadmap governs sequencing and discipline.

---

## **Closing Statement**

IER is **normatively closed**.

Future releases exist only to:

* stabilize articulation
* make implicit structure explicit
* prevent long-term drift
* preserve interpretive coherence

This roadmap is intentionally finite.

> **IER does not advance by expansion.
> It completes by constraint.**
