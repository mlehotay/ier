# **IER — Release Roadmap**

## **Status**

This document is **non-canonical**, **non-authoritative**, and **non-binding**.

It:

* introduces **no ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical commitments**
* proposes **no revisions** to the IER Specification
* authorizes **no new claims, diagnostics, or methods**
* does **not** reopen normative closure

All binding authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

* `IER-specification.md`
* governed by `IER-canon.md`

If any conflict arises, **canonical documents take precedence and this document is void**.

---

## **Purpose**

`IER-roadmap.md` defines the **intended sequencing and scope discipline** for future IER releases **after normative closure (v10.8)**.

It exists to:

1. Map **which kinds of work belong in which versions**
2. Prevent **scope creep across patch releases**
3. Separate **checklist completeness** from **release readiness**
4. Provide a psychologically and structurally finite release ladder

This document is **not**:

* a list of tasks
* a substitute for `IER-future-work.md`
* a theory roadmap
* a promise of future features

`IER-future-work.md` remains the **authoritative inventory of permissible work**.
This document specifies **when and how subsets of that work should be released**.

---

## **Versioning Principle**

> **IER version numbers track changes in authoritative commitment, not effort.**

Accordingly:

* **PATCH releases (v10.8.x)** may include:

  * articulation tightening
  * consolidation of implied consequences
  * translation and rubric-facing clarification
  * misuse- and misreading-containment
  * navigation and orientation improvements

* **MINOR releases (v10.9)** are permitted **only if**:

  * identity conditions change
  * necessary or sufficient conditions change
  * ethical consequences change
  * epistemic limits change
  * normative closure is reopened

No currently planned work meets the criteria for **v10.9**.

# **Release Ladder**

## **v10.8.3 — Part II Diachronic Completion**

**Intent:**

> *Time-extended experiential organization made explicit.*

This release draws **only** from items already enumerated in `IER-future-work.md`, specifically those that:

* close diachronic explanatory gaps
* prevent representational or graded-onset imports
* complete consequences already implied by IER v10.8

### Scope discipline

* Up to **four (4)** new **Tier-2** documents total
* No new domains
* No rubric packaging
* No evaluation-facing material

### Expected content families

* Memory as structural history (not storage or representation)
* Development and maturation as pre-UEF preparation
* Skill, habit, expertise, and automaticity as attractor narrowing
* Mood and temperament as long-horizon constraint bias

### Absorption rule (mandatory)

To prevent document sprawl, the following **must be absorbed** into existing documents as sections or appendices rather than standalone files:

* Dreams → `IER-sleep.md`
* Specious present / flow → `IER-continuity.md`
* Amnesia → memory document
* Attention → skill / agency document

### Explicit exclusions

* Rubric matrices
* Falsifiability discussions
* NCC or neuroscience reframing
* AI evaluation or certification expansion

**Stopping condition:**
Readers can no longer plausibly import representational memory, proto-experience, or graded onset **without adding new theory**.

---

## **v10.8.4 — Rubric & Evaluation Hardening**

**Intent:**

> *IER can be evaluated correctly without distortion.*

This release is **evaluation-facing**, not phenomenology-facing.

### Scope

Material that prevents **mis-evaluation**, **mis-ranking**, or **misclassification** of IER by external rubrics.

### Includes

* Explanandum matrices (what IER explains vs excludes)
* Identity conditions vs diagnostics clarification
* Falsifiability without tests articulation
* Theory contrast matrices
* AI slack-based exclusion clarifications (non-certifying)

### Tier discipline

* Misuse-blocking → **Tier-3**
* Orientation / translation → **Tier-4**

### Excludes

* New experiential phenomena
* Part II expansions
* Engineering, detection, or implementation guidance

---

## **v10.8.5 — Reader Navigation & Polish (Optional)**

**Intent:**

> *Lower friction, zero new substance.*

This release is optional and non-blocking.

### Includes

* Cross-linking improvements
* Reading-path cleanup
* Glossary and index polish
* Tone and clarity edits

### Excludes

* New documents
* New sections
* Structural or authority changes

---

## **v10.9 — Explicitly Not Planned**

A bump to **v10.9** is **not authorized** under this roadmap.

It would be justified **only if**:

* identity conditions change
* necessary or sufficient conditions change
* ethical consequences change
* epistemic limits are altered
* normative closure is reopened

No currently planned work meets these criteria.

---

## **Global Guardrail**

> **If a proposed addition does not prevent a concrete misreading or close a structural gap, it must not be released.**

The following are **insufficient justifications** for new work:

* “It would help some readers”
* “Someone might ask”
* “This completes the picture”
* “This would be nice to have”

All future releases must be defensible **solely** in terms of misreading prevention and structural inevitability.

---

## **Relationship to `IER-future-work.md`**

* `IER-future-work.md`
  → **What** work is permitted (exhaustive checklist)

* `IER-roadmap.md`
  → **When and how** subsets of that work are released

The checklist remains authoritative for scope.
The roadmap governs sequencing and release discipline.

---

## **Closing Statement**

IER is **normatively closed**.

Future work exists only to:

* stabilize articulation
* prevent misinterpretation
* preserve long-term coherence

This roadmap is intentionally finite.

> **IER does not advance by expansion.
> It completes by constraint.**
