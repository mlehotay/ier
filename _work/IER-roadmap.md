# **IER — Release Roadmap**

## **Status**

This document is **non-canonical**, **non-authoritative**, and **non-binding**.

It:

* introduces **no ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical commitments**
* proposes **no revisions** to the IER Specification
* authorizes **no new claims, diagnostics, or methods**
* does **not** reopen normative closure

All binding authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

* `IER-specification.md`
* governed by `IER-canon.md`

If any conflict arises, **canonical documents take precedence and this document is void**.

---

## **Purpose**

`IER-roadmap.md` defines the **intended sequencing and scope discipline** for future IER releases **after normative closure (v10.8)**.

It exists to:

1. Describe **what kinds of work justify which version increments**
2. Prevent **patch-version scope creep**
3. Distinguish **structural consolidation** from **editorial cleanup**
4. Keep the project **finite, legible, and non-aspirational**

This document is **not**:

* a task list
* a promise of future work
* a theory roadmap
* a substitute for `IER-future-work.md`

`IER-future-work.md` remains the **authoritative inventory of permissible work**.
This document governs **when and how subsets of that work are released**.

---

# **Versioning Principle (Reaffirmed)**

> **IER version numbers track changes in binding interpretive structure, not repository activity.**

All post–v10.8 releases preserve:

* the IER identity claim
* categorical subjecthood
* non-diagnosability
* ethical closure
* canon authority hierarchy

No release listed here reopens normative closure.

# **Release Roadmap**

## **v10.9.0 — Structural Consolidation of Choice, Time, and History**

**Intent:**

> *Make explicit a large set of interdependent structures that were previously implicit, scattered, or underdetermined.*

This release performs **no foundational revision** and introduces **no new primitives**.
It **does** substantially **narrow admissible interpretations** by consolidating how IER treats:

* choice and traversal
* admissible futures
* resolution and ownership
* temporal asymmetry
* sedimentation and history
* deformation of future possibility
* psychopathology as resolution failure

### **Characteristics**

* Significant **Tier-2 expansion**
* Coordinated clarification across many documents
* Explicit closure of previously “hand-wavy” explanatory gaps
* Reader-facing synthesis added where needed

This release should be understood as:

> **a single, coherent interpretive tightening event**,
> not a sequence of incremental patches.

### **Hexad Integration (Reduced-Scale)**

Work related to the hexad and projection structure is **merged into this release**, but **at deliberately reduced rigidity**.

Specifically:

* The hexad is treated as a **recurring explanatory pattern**, not a governing ontology
* Projections are understood as **overlapping descriptive lenses**, not orthogonal axes
* Articles may legitimately span multiple projections
* No enforcement of projection purity is introduced
* No refactors are required to “fit” a projection

`IER-hexad.md` and related materials serve as **orientation and navigation aids**, not architectural constraints.

### **Explicit Non-Goals**

This release does **not**:

* introduce projection isolation rules
* enforce interface discipline
* require article realignment
* delete or relocate legacy prose
* claim that the hexad is exhaustive or privileged

**Outcome:**

IER becomes **structurally clearer, temporally grounded, and choice-coherent**, without sacrificing organic overlap or explanatory richness.

---

## **v10.9.1+ — Optional Clarification and Alignment Passes**

**Intent:**

> *Improve clarity and local coherence without reopening structure.*

These are **optional patch releases**, not obligations.

### **Permitted Work**

* Local clarification edits
* Cross-reference cleanup
* Light reorganization for readability
* Non-semantic tightening of language
* Correction of accidental ambiguity revealed by v10.9.0

### **Explicit Constraints**

* No new documents that add binding structure
* No reclassification of article scope
* No introduction of enforcement mechanisms
* No expansion of projection discipline

These releases exist **only if they prevent concrete misreadings**.

---

## **v10.10 — Explicitly Not Planned**

A bump to **v10.10** is **not authorized** under this roadmap.

It would be justified **only if**:

* the identity claim changes
* necessary or sufficient conditions change
* ethical consequences change
* epistemic limits are revised
* normative closure is reopened

No currently anticipated work meets these criteria.

---

## **Global Guardrail**

> **If a proposed addition does not block a real misreading or resolve a structural ambiguity, it must not be released.**

IER advances by **constraint**, not accumulation.

---

## **Relationship to `IER-future-work.md`**

* `IER-future-work.md`
  → **What** work is permitted (complete inventory)

* `IER-roadmap.md`
  → **When and how** that work may be released

The checklist governs scope.
The roadmap governs discipline.

---

## **Closing Statement**

IER is **normatively closed**.

Future releases exist only to:

* stabilize articulation
* consolidate structure
* make implicit dependencies explicit
* prevent interpretive drift

This roadmap is intentionally short and conservative.

> **IER does not grow by adding ideas.
> It completes by removing ambiguity.**
