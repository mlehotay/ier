# **IER — Release Roadmap**

## **Status**

This document is **non-canonical**, **non-authoritative**, and **non-binding**.

It:

* introduces **no ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical commitments**
* proposes **no revisions** to the IER Specification
* authorizes **no new claims, diagnostics, or methods**
* does **not** reopen normative closure

All binding authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

* `IER-specification.md`
* governed by `IER-canon.md`

If any conflict arises, **canonical documents take precedence and this document is void**.

---

## **Purpose**

`IER-roadmap.md` defines the **intended sequencing and scope discipline** for future IER releases **after normative closure (v10.8)**.

It exists to:

1. Map **which kinds of work belong in which versions**
2. Prevent **scope creep across patch releases**
3. Separate **checklist completeness** from **release readiness**
4. Provide a psychologically and structurally finite release ladder

This document is **not**:

* a list of tasks
* a substitute for `IER-future-work.md`
* a theory roadmap
* a promise of future features

`IER-future-work.md` remains the **authoritative inventory of permissible work**.
This document specifies **when and how subsets of that work should be released**.

# **Release Roadmap**

## **Versioning Principle (Reaffirmed)**

> **IER patch versions track changes in articulation, not expansion of authority.**

All releases below preserve:

* the IER identity claim
* categorical subjecthood
* non-diagnosability
* closed ethical commitments
* canon authority structure

No listed release reopens normative closure.

---

## **v10.8.4 — Diachronic Organization (Focused Completion)**

**Intent:**

> *Complete IER’s account of time-extended experiential organization.*

This release treats diachrony **properly and deliberately**, without rushing.

> This release introduces **no new primitives, mechanisms, criteria, or explanatory levels**. All material consists of **structural consequences and organizational clarifications** already implied by the IER identity claim.

### **Core Topics**

* Memory as structural history (integration pass)
* Forgetting as pruning / dissolution (integration pass)
* Development and maturation as pre-UEF preparation
* Skill, habit, automaticity, and flow as attractor narrowing
* Long-horizon affect: mood and temperament
* Attention as constraint allocation (integrative, optional)

All material:

* presupposes categorical onset
* introduces no proto-experience
* rejects representational storage
* avoids sub-agents and scripts
* preserves non-diagnosability

## **v10.8.5 — Navigation, Formatting, and Polish (Optional)**

**Intent:**

> *Reduce reader friction without changing substance.*

> No changes in this release alter meaning, commitments, or interpretive constraints.

### **Includes**

* Glossary and index polish
* Cross-link refinement
* Reading-path cleanup
* Formatting, LaTeX, and glyph hygiene
* Tone and clarity edits

#### **B. Misuse & Misreading Containment**

* Diagnostic / proxy language sweep across Tier-2
* Informational-language disclaimer verification
* Phenomenology-adjacent graded-subjecthood audit
* Global reinforcement: *experiential structure ≠ epistemic authority*

#### **D. Navigation & Orientation Cleanup**

* Glossary and index expansion
* Canonical cross-linking
* README reading-path audit
* Minimal “where to go next” pointers by audience

### **Excludes**

* New documents
* New sections
* Any authority-affecting change

---

## **v10.9 — Explicitly Not Planned**

A bump to **v10.9** is **not authorized** under this roadmap.

It would be justified **only if**:

* identity conditions change
* necessary or sufficient conditions change
* ethical consequences change
* epistemic limits are altered
* normative closure is reopened

No currently planned work meets these criteria.

---

## **Global Guardrail**

> **If a proposed addition does not prevent a concrete misreading or close a structural gap, it must not be released.**

IER advances by **constraint**, not accumulation.

---

## **Relationship to `IER-future-work.md`**

* `IER-future-work.md`
  → **What** work is permitted (exhaustive checklist)

* `IER-roadmap.md`
  → **When and how** subsets of that work are released

The checklist remains authoritative for scope.
The roadmap governs sequencing and release discipline.

---

## **Closing Statement**

IER is **normatively closed**.

Future work exists only to:

* stabilize articulation
* prevent misinterpretation
* preserve long-term coherence

This roadmap is intentionally finite.

> **IER does not advance by expansion.
> It completes by constraint.**
