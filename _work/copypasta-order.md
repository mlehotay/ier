## ✅ **Correct Writing Order (Structural Dependency Order)**

### **1️⃣ `IER-choice-topology.md`**

**(Foundation layer — must come first)**

**Why first:**
This article defines the **primary object everything else operates on**: admissible futures as structured topology.

Everything downstream assumes:

* futures are structural, not representational
* choice is geometry, not selection
* possibility exists *before* traversal

If this isn’t written first, later articles are forced to smuggle in topology implicitly.

**Dependency role:**

> Defines the space.

### **2️⃣ `IER-traversal.md`**

**(Dynamics layer — movement through topology)**

**Why second:**
Traversal explains **what happens when paths are actually taken**:

* curing
* settlement
* irreversible commitment

Without traversal, topology is static.
Without traversal, sedimentation has no cause.

**Dependency role:**

> Defines motion and irreversible path-taking.

### **3️⃣ `IER-sedimented-substrate.md`**

**(Diachronic persistence layer)**

**Why third:**
This article answers:

> *What remains after traversal, without storage?*

It formalizes:

* sedimentation
* hysteresis
* unowned deformation
* integration (structural)

This *must* come before trauma and sleep, because both rely on **persistent deformation** already being defined.

**Dependency role:**

> Defines what traversal leaves behind.

---

### **4️⃣ `IER-history-future-boundary.md`**

**(Keystone synthesis — locates experience)**

**Why fourth (not first):**
This article *names* the boundary object, but it **presupposes**:

* topology (1)
* traversal (2)
* sedimentation (3)

If written earlier, it would feel metaphysical.
Written here, it feels inevitable.

This is where:

* experience is finally *located*
* the present becomes a frontier
* welding becomes precise

**Dependency role:**

> Locates intrinsic constraint and experience.

### **5️⃣ `IER-navigation-control.md`**

**(Control surface — cognition)**

**Why fifth:**
Navigation-control explains **how a UEF operates on the boundary**:

* cognition knobs
* raw vs cured paths
* past-thinking = future-thinking

This article assumes:

* the boundary exists (4)
* paths are differently fixed (3)

It should *not* precede the boundary article, or it will look like cognitive theory instead of structural control.

**Dependency role:**

> Explains steering within existing structure.

---

### **6️⃣ `IER-sleep-welding-capacity.md`**

**(Regime maintenance layer)**

**Why sixth:**
Sleep only makes sense once we know:

* welding is continuous (4)
* welding consumes capacity (2+3)
* navigation narrows over time (5)

This article explains **why the system must stop resolving** to survive.

**Dependency role:**

> Explains recovery from irreversible cost.

---

### **7️⃣ `IER-trauma.md`**

**(Deformation under failure conditions — must be last)**

**Why last:**
Trauma is the **stress test** of the whole structure.

It requires:

* topology (what is deformed)
* traversal (what happened)
* sedimentation (what persisted)
* boundary (where constraint failed)
* navigation (what became impossible)

If written earlier, it collapses into metaphor or psychology.
Written last, it reads as *inevitable consequence*.

**Dependency role:**

> Explains survival under abrupt unowned deformation.
