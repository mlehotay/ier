# **IER v10.8.4 — Unified Completion Checklist**

**Part II: Time-Extended Organization Under Intrinsic Constraint**

---

## Files to create

* `IER-fringe.md` (D2)
* `IER-dreaming-proof.md` *(D3, only if not absorbed as an appendix)*
* `IER-specious-present.md` *(D6, only if not absorbed into `IER-continuity.md`)*
* `IER-ownership-map.md` *(D7, only if not absorbed into `IER-agency.md` or `IER-access.md`)*
* `IER-infants.md` (D10)
* **One long-horizon anchor (recommended, if you don’t want 2–3 separate docs):**

  * `IER-long-horizon.md` *(working name: skill + habit + mood + temperament + attention as integrative sections)*
    **OR** split into:
  * `IER-skill.md`
  * `IER-mood.md`
  * *(and keep “attention” as a section inside one of those, not standalone)*

## Files to modify (definite)

* `IER-manifest.md` (add new docs + tiers/order)
* `IER-FAQ.md` (add “Rubric quick answers” links to the new docs)

## Files to modify (if you choose “appendix instead of new doc”)

* `IER-sleep.md` *(absorb D3 as an appendix; add explicit “Dreams” heading + IFF argument)*
* `IER-continuity.md` *(absorb D6; add explicit “Specious Present” and “Flow” headings)*
* `IER-agency.md` **or** `IER-access.md` *(absorb D7; add explicit “Mineness / For-me-ness / Ownership” heading + mapping table)*

## Files to modify (light-touch alignment / insertions, recommended)

* `IER-memory.md` *(add the few missing explicit refusals/clarifications: unremembered-but-decisive history; no “memory without experience”; felt authority ≠ epistemic authority; diachronic identity not memory-based)*

## A. Global Constraints (Must Hold Everywhere)

* [ ] No new ontological primitives
* [ ] No new criterial or sufficiency conditions
* [ ] No diagnostics, indicators, or measurements
* [ ] Preserve categorical experiential onset
* [ ] Preserve non-diagnosability
* [ ] No representational, proto-experiential, or graded imports
* [ ] All claims strictly downstream of v10.8 identity commitments

---

## B. Core Diachronic Spine (Required)

### B1. Memory / Structural History

* [ ] Memory treated as **experiential re-entry into sedimented constraint**, not storage
* [ ] Explicit distinction: sedimentation ≠ hysteresis ≠ memory
* [ ] Structural availability ≠ experiential participation
* [ ] Explicit statement: **unremembered history can remain structurally decisive**
* [ ] Explicit refusal: “memory without experience”
* [ ] Explicit refusal: memory as epistemic authority
* [ ] Cross-link to admissible futures and ethical foreclosure

---

## C. Temporal Coherence & Flow

### C1. Specious Present / Flow

* [ ] Specious present defined as **minimal window of coherent intrinsic constraint**
* [ ] Flow = persistence of regime coherence across successive windows
* [ ] Explicit rejection of snapshot / sampling metaphors
* [ ] Explicit rejection of measurable window sizes
* [ ] Explicit statement: memory does not unify experience

---

## D. Participation & Access Consolidation

### D1. Fringe / Peripheral Awareness

* [ ] Fringe awareness defined as **weak or unstable participation under intact UEF**
* [ ] Low participation ≠ partial subjecthood
* [ ] Structural availability ≠ current participation
* [ ] Worked examples: vague sound, “something’s off,” TOT
* [ ] Boxed warning: **Do not infer graded consciousness**
* [ ] Explicit distinction: limited access ≠ non-experience

---

## E. State Variants (No New Criteria)

### E1. Dreaming

* [ ] Prose IFF: dreams are conscious **iff** a UEF persists
* [ ] Altered insight/agency explained as participation topology change
* [ ] Explicit rejection of reportability as justification
* [ ] Explicit rejection of dream diagnostics or sleep-stage criteria

---

## F. Ownership & Mineness Translation

### F1. Ownership Map

* [ ] Translation table:

* mineness → ownership of intrinsic constraint
* for-me-ness → non-externalizable burden
* self-boundary → regime-relative system boundary
  * [ ] Examples: pain, decision pressure, dissociation
  * [ ] Explicit statement: translation ≠ reduction to reports
  * [ ] Explicit rejection of self as entity

---

## G. Development & Preparation

### G1. Infants / Development

* [ ] Continuous accumulation of preparatory variables
* [ ] Categorical experiential onset preserved
* [ ] Explicit rejection of proto-experience
* [ ] Explicit rejection of developmental diagnostics
* [ ] Ethical note: scoped precaution under uncertainty
* [ ] No biological milestones treated as criterial

---

## H. Long-Horizon Organization (Completion, Not Expansion)

### H1. Skill / Habit / Automaticity

* [ ] Skill = collapse into narrow, low-cost attractors
* [ ] Automaticity = reduced global load, not unconscious agent
* [ ] Explicit rejection of representational scripts
* [ ] Explicit rejection of dual-track cognition

### H2. Mood / Temperament

* [ ] Mood as persistent bias in constraint geometry
* [ ] Temperament as long-horizon attractor structure
* [ ] Mood disorders framed as structural skew, not diagnostic kinds
* [ ] No psychological or clinical import

### H3. Attention (Integrative Only)

* [ ] Attention = intrinsic constraint allocation / recruitment
* [ ] Explicit distinction from control, authorship, or subject creation
* [ ] Integrated with memory, skill, and mood (not standalone unless necessary)

---

## I. Diachronic Identity Clarifications (Leak Prevention)

* [ ] Explicit statement: diachronic identity is **system/regime-based**, not memory-based
* [ ] Explicit statement: irreversible change ≠ subject replacement
* [ ] Explicit statement: felt past authority is organizational, not epistemic
* [ ] Direction of time explained via irreversible constraint deformation

---

## J. Explicit Refusals (Must Be Visible)

* [ ] No measurable specious present
* [ ] No memory-based subject persistence
* [ ] No unconscious experiencers
* [ ] No developmental or dream diagnostics
* [ ] No degrees or continua of experience

---

## K. Integration & Navigation

### K1. Manifest

* [ ] Add new docs / appendices to `IER-manifest.md`
* [ ] Preserve tier classifications

### K2. FAQ

* [ ] Add “rubric quick answers” section
* [ ] Link:

* memory → structural history
* fringe → participation
* dreams → UEF persistence
* infants → preparation + categorical onset
  * [ ] No expansion of scope

---

## L. Version Framing

* [ ] Frame v10.8.4 explicitly as **Part II completion**
* [ ] Language emphasizes closure, inevitability, and gap-filling
* [ ] No suggestion of theoretical growth or revision

---

## Completion Criterion (Single Sentence Test)

> *A careful reader should be unable to ask a time-extended question about experience, memory, development, skill, or continuity without the corpus already containing a structurally correct answer — or an explicit refusal.*
