## **IER-continuity.md — Explanatory Orientation (Time)**

### **Explanatory Orientation**

**Question answered**
This article answers the question: **What is happening now?**
It explains temporal continuity and passage as features of irreversible constraint resolution.

**Foregrounded aspect of constraint**
This projection foregrounds **asymmetry and traversal** within constraint geometry—how admissible futures are eliminated in a directionally irreversible manner.

**Treated as fixed**
The following are held invariant throughout this account:

* the existence of intrinsic constraint
* the irreversibility of constraint resolution
* the continued existence of a single physical system sustaining a Unified Experiential Field

**Allowed to vary**
Within this projection, the following may vary:

* which admissible futures remain available
* how rapidly alternatives are eliminated
* the local structure of continuity across experiential gaps

**Non-claims**
This projection does **not** assert:

* a privileged present or moving “now”
* a temporal container or background dimension
* stored sequences of past states
* spacetime metaphysics or temporal substances

## **IER-memory.md — Explanatory Orientation (Memory)**

### **Explanatory Orientation**

**Question answered**
This article answers the question: **What remains reachable?**
It explains remembering and forgetting as features of future accessibility under current constraint.

**Foregrounded aspect of constraint**
This projection foregrounds **reachability and re-entry**—which experiential organizations remain admissible given the present constraint geometry.

**Treated as fixed**
The following are held invariant throughout this account:

* the absence of stored experiential content
* the irreversibility of constraint resolution
* the binding of admissible futures to the system under intrinsic constraint

**Allowed to vary**
Within this projection, the following may vary:

* accessibility of prior experiential organizations
* viability of participation pathways
* pruning of re-entry routes under constraint evolution

**Non-claims**
This projection does **not** assert:

* memory storage, traces, or archives
* retrieval, recall mechanisms, or representations of the past
* temporal relations to “past states” as objects
* mnemonic substrates or encoding schemes

## **IER-identity.md — Explanatory Orientation (Identity)**

### **Explanatory Orientation**

**Question answered**
This article answers the question: **Who is bearing this?**
It explains personal identity as persistence of intrinsic constraint ownership across time.

**Foregrounded aspect of constraint**
This projection foregrounds **ownership persistence**—the continued binding of admissible futures to the same physical system across changes in experiential organization.

**Treated as fixed**
The following are held invariant throughout this account:

* the physical system boundary
* the existence of intrinsic constraint
* the continued existence of a physical system sustaining a Unified Experiential Field

**Allowed to vary**
Within this projection, the following may vary:

* experiential contents
* the organization of admissible futures under constraint deformation
* structural narrowing of future-bearing capacity

**Non-claims**
This projection does **not** assert:

* memory-based identity criteria
* narrative, psychological, or personality continuity
* similarity metrics across time
* identity as a representational or informational construct
* experiential continuity as an identity requirement

## **IER-agency.md — Explanatory Orientation (Agency)**

### **Explanatory Orientation**

**Question answered**
This article answers the question: **Is this resolution owned?**
It explains agency as owned collapse of admissible futures under intrinsic constraint.

**Foregrounded aspect of constraint**
This projection foregrounds **collapse under ownership**—the irreversible resolution of multiple admissible trajectories into a single continuation borne non-externalizably by the system.

**Treated as fixed**
The following are held invariant throughout this account:

* the presence of multiple admissible futures prior to resolution
* the irreversibility of collapse
* the system-level ownership of constraint resolution

**Allowed to vary**
Within this projection, the following may vary:

* the size and structure of the choice space
* the organizational pressure manifest as inevitability or effort
* the dynamical point at which resolution becomes unavoidable within the system

**Non-claims**
This projection does **not** assert:

* indeterminism or randomness
* executive controllers or decision modules
* deliberation or representation of options
* freedom as exemption from constraint

## **IER-sedimentation.md — Explanatory Orientation (History)**

### **Explanatory Orientation**

**Question answered**
This article answers the question: **Why is the system shaped this way?**
It explains historical influence as sedimentation of constraint without storage.

**Foregrounded aspect of constraint**
This projection foregrounds **sedimentation and hysteresis**—the hardening and reshaping of constraint geometry through prior resolution.

**Treated as fixed**
The following are held invariant throughout this account:

* the absence of stored past states
* the irreversibility of constraint modification
* the continuity of the underlying physical system across constraint deformation

**Allowed to vary**
Within this projection, the following may vary:

* degrees of freedom available for future response
* rigidity or plasticity of the constraint geometry
* sensitivity to perturbation under accumulated constraint

**Non-claims**
This projection does **not** assert:

* stored memories of the past
* replay, retrieval, or encoded history
* temporal databases or state records
* causal influence of non-existent past entities
