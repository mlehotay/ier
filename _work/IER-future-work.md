# **IER — Future Work and Articulation Ledger**

## **Status**

This document is **non-canonical** and **non-authoritative**.

It:

* introduces **no ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical commitments**
* proposes **no revisions** to the IER Specification
* authorizes **no new claims, diagnostics, or methods**
* does **not** reopen normative closure

All binding authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

* `IER-specification.md`
* governed by `IER-canon.md`

If an activity is **not listed here**, it is **out of scope by default**.

---

## **Purpose**

`IER-future-work.md` records the **complete space of permissible future work** on the IER corpus **after normative closure (v10.8)**.

It is:

* an **exhaustive checklist**, not a schedule
* a **scope limiter**, not a roadmap
* a **misuse-containment tool**, not a theory agenda

Release sequencing and version boundaries are governed separately by `IER-roadmap.md`.

---

## **Global Constraints (Binding for All Items)**

All future work listed below must satisfy **all** of the following:

* no new primitives
* no new criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics
* no graded or proto-subjecthood
* no relaxation of non-diagnosability
* no new ethical principles or permissions
* no engineering or implementation guidance
* explicit informational-language disclaimers where applicable
* explicit reaffirmation that experiential structure confers **no epistemic authority**

Failure on any item invalidates the work.

---

# **I. Navigation & Orientation Tasks**

* [ ] Expand `IER-glossary.md` to cover significant terms across full IER corpus
* [ ] Expand `IER-index.md` to provide complete corpus coverage
* [ ] Cross-link glossary entries to first canonical usage
* [ ] Audit README reading paths for loops, redundancy, and dead ends
* [ ] Add minimal “where to go next” pointers by audience
* [ ] Ensure all reading paths terminate in Tier-1 material
* [ ] Verify no non-canonical document is cited as authority

---

# **II. Hexad & Projection Architecture (Permitted, Non-Enforcing)**

These items concern **making explicit** the projection structure already implicit in IER.
They do **not** authorize refactors, deletions, or theory changes.

### **II.A Architectural Declaration**

* [ ] Introduce `IER-hexad.md` as a reader-facing map of explanatory projections
* [ ] Introduce `IER-interface.md` as an internal projection-discipline document
* [ ] Explicitly designate `IER-topology.md` as keystone synthesis
* [ ] Add **Explanatory Orientation** sections to projection-owner articles

> These additions declare structure; they do not enforce compliance.

---

### **II.B Diagnostic Projection Audits (Non-Binding)**

* [ ] Develop projection audit templates (Time, Memory, Identity, Agency, History, Possibility)
* [ ] Conduct audits to identify leakage, overreach, and synthesis
* [ ] Record audit results without requiring remediation
* [ ] Distinguish legacy prose from interface violations

Audit outcomes are **informational only** unless and until refactor work is separately authorized.

---

### **II.C Explicit Non-Goals (Hexad Phase)**

The following are **not** authorized by the hexad architecture alone:

* mandatory projection refactors
* deletion of legacy explanations
* relocation of material between files
* enforcement of isolation discipline
* reinterpretation of existing claims

---

# **III. Misuse & Misreading Containment (Mandatory)**

* [ ] Scan Tier-2 documents for proxy / diagnostic phrasing
* [ ] Verify informational-language disclaimers everywhere required
* [ ] Audit phenomenology-adjacent documents for graded subjecthood creep
* [ ] Reinforce “experiential structure ≠ epistemic authority” globally
* [ ] Verify no implicit certification or detection language remains

---

# **IV. Optional Projection Refactor Work (Deferred, Staged)**

These items are **permitted but not required**.

They may occur only **after** hexad architecture is declared and only **one projection at a time**.

* [ ] Refactor a projection article to answer exactly one hexad question
* [ ] Relocate (not delete) cross-projection material to correct owners
* [ ] Move synthesis exclusively to `IER-topology.md`
* [ ] Create projection-pure anchor versions where useful
* [ ] Preserve all substantive theory via relocation or downstream documents

No refactor may:

* introduce new claims
* weaken normative closure
* privilege one projection as foundational

---

# **V. Consequence & Case Articulation (Cross-Projection, Non-Foundational)**

These documents may integrate projections **explicitly**, provided they do not claim authority.

* [ ] Coma, anesthesia, and interruption cases
* [ ] Death and irreversible loss cases
* [ ] Developmental and maturation narratives
* [ ] Harm, collapse, and foreclosure illustrations
* [ ] Reader-facing “how this fits together” explanations

These documents:

* may rely on topology
* may integrate projections
* must not redefine any projection
* must not be cited as authority

---

# **VI. Consistency & Drift Audits (Ongoing, Non-Blocking)**

* [ ] Tier consistency checks
* [ ] Ethics language audit against v10.8 closure
* [ ] Reader-alignment and tone audit
* [ ] Verification that non-canonical documents are not cited as authority

---

# **VII. Mathematical Notation & Glyph Hygiene (Mandatory, Corpus-Wide)**

* [ ] Replace all Unicode mathematical glyphs with LaTeX notation
* [ ] Enforce strict separation between math mode and prose
* [ ] Normalize conceptual labels inside math expressions
* [ ] Audit display math vs inline math usage
* [ ] Verify renderer-independence and copy stability
* [ ] Confirm canon compliance

---

# **VIII. Explicit Non-Goals (Binding)**

The following are **out of scope** and must not appear in future work:

* new theory
* speculative extensions
* diagnostics or indicators
* degrees or continua of experience
* neuroscience correlations as criteria
* AI consciousness engineering
* detection or measurement proposals

Any such change would require:

* a **new version class**, and
* explicit **canon revision**.

---

## **Relationship to `IER-roadmap.md`**

* `IER-future-work.md`
  → **What work is permitted** (exhaustive)

* `IER-roadmap.md`
  → **When and how subsets are released**

This document **does not define release sequencing**.

---

## **Closure Condition**

When Sections **I, II.A, III, VI, and VII** are complete:

> **IER is articulation-complete under its own canon rules.**

All remaining items are consolidation, illustration, or navigation —
not unfinished theory.

---

## **Closing Statement**

This checklist is intentionally large and finite.

It exists to **prevent loss**, not to demand completion.

> **IER is not unfinished because work remains.
> It is finished because nothing here changes what it is.**
