# **IER — Future Work and Articulation Ledger (Expanded)**

## **Status**

This document is **non-canonical** and **non-authoritative**.

It:

* introduces **no ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical commitments**
* proposes **no revisions** to the IER Specification
* authorizes **no new claims, diagnostics, or methods**
* does **not** reopen normative closure

All binding authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

* `IER-specification.md`
* governed by `IER-canon.md`

If an activity is **not listed here**, it is **out of scope by default**.

---

## **Purpose**

`IER-future-work.md` records the **complete space of permissible future work** on the IER corpus **after normative closure (v10.8)**.

It is:

* an **exhaustive checklist**, not a schedule
* a **scope limiter**, not a roadmap
* a **misuse-containment tool**, not a theory agenda

Release sequencing is governed separately by `IER-roadmap.md`.

---

## **Global Constraints (Binding for All Items)**

All future work listed below must satisfy **all** of the following:

* no new primitives
* no new criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics
* no graded or proto-subjecthood
* no relaxation of non-diagnosability
* no new ethical principles or permissions
* no engineering or implementation guidance
* explicit informational-language disclaimers where applicable
* explicit reaffirmation that experiential structure confers **no epistemic authority**

Failure on any item invalidates the work.

# **I. Navigation & Orientation Tasks**

* [ ] Expand `IER-glossary.md` to cover significant terms across full IER corpus
* [ ] Expand `IER-index.md` to provide complete corpus coverage
* [ ] Cross-link glossary entries to first canonical usage
* [ ] Audit README reading paths for loops, redundancy, and dead ends
* [ ] Add minimal “where to go next” pointers by audience
* [ ] Ensure all reading paths terminate in Tier-1 material
* [ ] Verify no non-canonical document is cited as authority

---

# **II. Mandatory Articulation Tightening (Non-Normative)**

Each clarification must appear **exactly once** as an **explicit non-inference**.

* [x] Anti-isomorphism clarification (`IER-theory.md`)
* [x] No nested subjects / no mini-fields (`IER-dynamics.md`)
* [x] Temporal continuity ≠ timescale threshold (`IER-theory.md` or `IER-math.md`)
* [x] Autopoiesis / operational closure denial (`IER-denials.md` or `IER-FAQ.md`)
* [x] Multiple realizability ≠ implementation independence (`IER-theory.md`)
* [x] Global metaphor audit (representation, sufficiency, epistemic creep)

---

# **III. Misuse & Misreading Containment (Mandatory)**

* [ ] Scan Tier-2 documents for proxy / diagnostic phrasing
* [ ] Verify informational-language disclaimers everywhere required
* [ ] Audit phenomenology-adjacent documents for graded subjecthood creep
* [ ] Reinforce “experiential structure ≠ epistemic authority” globally
* [ ] Verify no implicit certification language remains

---

# **IV. History & Lineage Guardrails (Mandatory)**

* [x] Add guardrail box to `IER-history.md` (no influence, no refutation, no evaluation)
* [x] Reaffirm Specification exclusivity explicitly

---

# **V. Diachronic & Time-Extended Organization (Part II Completion)**

*(All items here presuppose categorical onset and intact UEF identity.)*

### **Memory & History**

* [ ] Memory as structural history (hysteresis, path-dependence, sedimentation)
* [x] Explicit rejection of memory as storage, representation, or content
* [ ] Amnesia as narrative discontinuity without experiential loss
* [ ] Memory authority without epistemic privilege

### **Development & Preparation**

* [ ] Development as accumulation of constraint-bearing capacity
* [ ] Pre-UEF preparation without proto-experience
* [ ] Infant / maturation trajectories with categorical onset preserved

### **Skill, Habit, Automaticity**

* [ ] Skill as attractor narrowing and load reduction
* [ ] Habit without scripts, sub-agents, or representations
* [ ] Automaticity as simplification, not delegation
* [ ] Flow as regime persistence across temporal windows

### **Affect Over Long Horizons**

* [ ] Mood as persistent constraint bias
* [ ] Temperament as long-horizon attractor geometry
* [ ] Mood disorder framing without clinical diagnostics

### **Attention (Integrative, Optional)**

* [ ] Attention as constraint allocation
* [ ] Participation recruitment vs subject creation
* [ ] Attention ≠ control, authorship, or epistemic access

---

# **VI. State-Specific Clarifications (Consolidative)**

* [ ] Dreams conscious iff UEF persists (input-independence argument)
* [ ] Specious present as minimal temporal coherence window
* [ ] Experiential flow without sampling or snapshots
* [ ] Fringe awareness as low-participation content
* [ ] Tip-of-the-tongue and “something’s off” phenomena
* [ ] Dissociation and ownership disruption without subject loss

---

# **VII. Rubric & Evaluation Hardening**

*(Evaluation-facing; no new experiential claims.)*

* [ ] Explanandum matrix (what IER explains vs excludes)
* [ ] Identity conditions vs diagnostics clarification
* [ ] “Identity ≠ detection rule” explicit statement
* [ ] Falsifiability without tests articulation
* [ ] Structural underdetermination explanation
* [ ] Contrast matrix with major theories (descriptive only)

---

# **VIII. AI, Engineering, and Boundary Stress Tests**

*(Misuse-blocking only; no certification.)*

* [ ] Expanded slack-based exclusion arguments for AI architectures
* [ ] Explicit “no certification” and “no sufficiency” language
* [ ] Clarify compatibility with neuroscience without becoming one
* [ ] Reaffirm engineering irrelevance to experiential attribution

---

# **IX. Tooling, Build, and Publication Infrastructure**

* [x] Machine-readable manifest or index
* [x] Validation scripts for book build
* [x] Sentinel enforcement
* [ ] Automated tier-violation checks
* [ ] Linting for forbidden language classes

---

# **X. Consistency & Drift Audits (Ongoing, Non-Blocking)**

* [ ] Tier consistency checks
* [ ] Ethics language audit against v10.8 closure
* [ ] Reader-alignment tone audit
* [ ] Verification that non-canonical docs are not cited as authority

---

# **XI. Tier Assignment Corrections (Mandatory)**

* [ ] Reclassify `IER-math.md` → T2
* [ ] Reclassify `IER-ethics.md` → T2

---

# **XII. Mathematical Notation & Glyph Hygiene (Mandatory, Corpus-Wide)**

* [ ] Replace all Unicode mathematical glyphs with LaTeX notation
* [ ] Enforce strict separation between math mode and prose
* [ ] Normalize conceptual labels inside math expressions
* [ ] Audit display math vs inline math usage
* [ ] Verify renderer-independence and copy stability
* [ ] Confirm canon compliance

---

# **XIII. Explicit Non-Goals (Binding)**

The following are **out of scope** and must not appear in future work:

* new theory
* speculative extensions
* diagnostics or indicators
* degrees or continua of experience
* neuroscience correlations as criteria
* AI consciousness engineering
* detection or measurement proposals

Any such change would require:

* a **new version class**, and
* explicit **canon revision**.

---

## **Relationship to `IER-roadmap.md`**

* `IER-future-work.md`
  → **What work is permitted** (exhaustive)

* `IER-roadmap.md`
  → **How and when subsets are released**

This document **does not define release sequencing**.

---

## **Closure Condition**

When Sections **II, III, IV, and XI** are complete:

> **IER is articulation-complete under its own canon rules.**

All remaining items are consolidation, translation, or navigation —
not unfinished theory.

---

## **Closing Statement**

This checklist is intentionally large and finite.

It exists to **prevent loss**, not to demand completion.

> **IER is not unfinished because work remains.
> It is finished because nothing here changes what it is.**
