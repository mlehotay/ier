# **IER — Future Work and Articulation Ledger**

## **Status**

This document is **non-canonical** and **non-authoritative**.

It:

* introduces **no ontological, criterial, epistemic, or ethical commitments**
* proposes **no revisions** to the IER Specification
* authorizes **no new claims, diagnostics, or methods**
* does **not** reopen normative closure

All binding authority remains fixed **exclusively** in:

* `IER-specification.md`
* governed by `IER-canon.md`

If an activity is **not listed here**, it is **out of scope by default**.

---

## **Purpose**

`IER-future-work.md` records the **complete and finite space of permissible future work** on the IER corpus **after normative closure (v10.8)**.

It is:

* an **exhaustive ledger**, not a plan
* a **scope limiter**, not an agenda
* a **misuse-containment device**, not a research program

Release sequencing and version boundaries are governed separately by `IER-roadmap.md`.

---

## **Global Constraints (Binding for All Items)**

All future work listed below must satisfy **all** of the following:

* no new primitives
* no new criteria, thresholds, or diagnostics
* no graded, proto-, or partial subjecthood
* no relaxation of non-diagnosability
* no new ethical principles, permissions, or tradeoffs
* no engineering, implementation, or optimization guidance
* explicit informational-language disclaimers where applicable
* explicit reaffirmation that experiential structure confers **no epistemic authority**

Failure on any item invalidates the work.

---

# **I. Navigation & Reader Orientation (Ongoing)**

These items concern **making the existing corpus legible**, not expanding it.

* [ ] Expand `IER-glossary.md` to cover all high-frequency canonical terms
* [ ] Expand `IER-index.md` to provide full corpus coverage
* [ ] Cross-link glossary entries to first **canonical** usage
* [ ] Audit reading paths for loops, dead ends, and redundancy
* [ ] Add minimal “where to go next” pointers by reader motivation
* [ ] Ensure all reading paths terminate in Tier-1 material
* [ ] Verify that no non-canonical document is cited as authority

---

# **II. Hexad & Projection Structure (Descriptive, Non-Enforcing)**

The hexad and projection language exists to **describe recurring explanatory patterns**, not to impose architectural constraints.

Projections are **overlapping lenses**, not orthogonal axes.

### **II.A Descriptive Structure (Largely Complete)**

* [x] Introduce `IER-hexad.md` as a reader-facing orientation map
* [x] Designate `IER-topology.md` as the primary synthesis anchor
* [ ] Lightly annotate projection-heavy articles with orientation notes where helpful

These steps **declare patterns**.
They do **not** impose purity, ownership, or isolation.

---

### **II.B Explicit Limits on Projection Use**

The following clarifications may be added **only where confusion persists**:

* Projections are not mutually exclusive
* Articles may legitimately span multiple projections
* No projection has priority or foundational status
* Projection membership has **no canonical force**

No enforcement mechanisms are authorized.

---

# **III. Misuse & Misreading Containment (Mandatory, Ongoing)**

These checks are required whenever new text is added or revised.

* [ ] Scan Tier-2 documents for diagnostic or proxy phrasing
* [ ] Verify informational-language disclaimers where required
* [ ] Audit phenomenology-adjacent prose for graded subjecthood creep
* [ ] Reinforce globally: *experiential structure ≠ epistemic authority*
* [ ] Verify absence of certification, detection, or measurement language
* [ ] Confirm no “functional sufficiency” or “access” framing leaks in

---

# **IV. Optional Clarification & Local Refactor Work (Deferred)**

These items are **permitted but not required**.
They exist to improve clarity, not structure.

* [ ] Local rewrites to reduce ambiguity or reader misinterpretation
* [ ] Relocation of material **only** to reduce redundancy (no deletion)
* [ ] Clarifying distinctions where multiple articles converge on the same structure
* [ ] Reader-facing summaries that explicitly integrate multiple lenses

Constraints:

* no new documents that add binding structure
* no projection purity requirements
* no reclassification of article scope
* no reinterpretation of existing claims

---

# **V. Case, Consequence, and Illustration Documents (Permitted)**

These documents may integrate multiple structures **explicitly**, but remain **non-authoritative**.

Examples include:

* coma, anesthesia, and interruption cases
* irreversible loss and death boundaries
* development and maturation narratives
* harm, collapse, and foreclosure illustrations
* reader-facing “how this fits together” explanations

Such documents:

* may rely on topology
* may integrate multiple projections
* must not redefine any construct
* must not be cited as authority

---

# **VI. Consistency & Drift Audits (Non-Blocking, Ongoing)**

* [ ] Tier consistency checks
* [ ] Ethics language audit against v10.8 closure
* [ ] Reader-alignment and tone audit
* [ ] Verification that non-canonical documents are not cited as authority
* [ ] Confirmation that new text does not narrow or expand normative scope

---

# **VII. Mathematical Notation & Rendering Hygiene (Mandatory)**

* [ ] Replace all Unicode math glyphs with LaTeX
* [ ] Enforce strict separation between math mode and prose
* [ ] Normalize conceptual labels inside math expressions
* [ ] Audit inline vs display math usage
* [ ] Verify renderer-independence and copy stability
* [ ] Confirm compliance with canon typography rules

---

# **VIII. Explicit Non-Goals (Binding)**

The following are **out of scope** and must not appear in future work:

* new theory
* speculative extensions
* diagnostics or indicators
* degrees or continua of experience
* neuroscience correlations as criteria
* AI consciousness engineering
* detection, testing, or measurement proposals

Any such change would require:

* a **new version class**, and
* explicit **canon revision**.

---

## **Relationship to `IER-roadmap.md`**

* `IER-future-work.md`
  → **What work is permitted** (complete inventory)

* `IER-roadmap.md`
  → **When and how subsets may be released**

This document defines **scope**, not sequence.

---

## **Closure Condition**

When Sections **I, II.A, III, VI, and VII** are complete:

> **IER is articulation-complete under its own canon rules.**

All remaining items are optional clarity, illustration, or navigation —
not unfinished theory.

---

## **Closing Statement**

This ledger is intentionally conservative and finite.

It exists to prevent **drift**, **inflation**, and **reinterpretation** —
not to demand completion.

> **IER is not unfinished because work remains.
> It is finished because nothing here changes what it is.**
