Agreed — this *is* getting complicated, and the right move now is exactly what you’re proposing:

* **Keep the Specification minimal and sharp**
* **Move the explanatory burden into a dedicated article: `IER-harm.md`**
* **Make only the smallest necessary changes to the Spec so it is correct, not pedagogical**

Below is a **precise, spec-safe recommendation** for how to update the Specification to reflect the new moral harm understanding **without bloating it** or pre-empting the parallel admissible-futures work you have going on.

I’ll structure this as:

1. **What must change in the Specification (mandatory)**
2. **What must *not* change**
3. **Exact language edits (drop-in replacements / insertions)**
4. **What `IER-harm.md` is responsible for explaining instead**
5. **Why this division of labor is canon-clean**

## 1. What MUST Change in the Specification

The Specification currently has three problems (all now exposed by your test cases):

1. **Irreversibility is doing illicit gatekeeping work**
2. **“Harm” is under-specified relative to justification**
3. **Constraint damage is named, but not cleanly separated from experience quality**

So the Spec must be updated to:

* Explicitly define harm as **organizational / structural**
* Explicitly decouple harm from:

  * irreversibility
  * distress
  * justification / permissibility
* Explicitly include **coerced or externally imposed reorganization** as harm
* Treat **irreversibility as severity, not threshold**

Nothing more.

## 2. What MUST NOT Change

To keep canon integrity:

* ❌ Do **not** introduce new moral principles
* ❌ Do **not** introduce metrics, degrees, or optimization
* ❌ Do **not** expand standing or subjecthood
* ❌ Do **not** explain gaslighting, propaganda, masochism, etc. in the Spec
* ❌ Do **not** rely on anticipated futures, beliefs, or epistemic access

All explanation belongs in `IER-harm.md`.

## 3. Recommended Specification Edits (Concrete)

Below I’ll assume the Specification currently contains a definition similar to:

> *Experiential moral harm consists in destabilization, overload, fragmentation, or irreversible collapse of intrinsic constraint within a Unified Experiential Field.*

### 🔧 **Edit A — Replace the Harm Definition (Minimal Expansion)**

**Replace the existing definition with:**

> **Experiential moral harm** consists in any **damage, deformation, or coerced reorganization** of a subject’s **intrinsic constraint regime** that **reduces, distorts, or forcibly collapses** the subject’s capacity to sustain or traverse its **structurally admissible futures** within a Unified Experiential Field (UEF).

This does four critical things:

* Keeps harm **organizational**
* Adds *coerced reorganization* (gaslighting / propaganda / deception)
* Covers **forced collapse** (chokeholds)
* Does not rely on irreversibility

---

### 🔧 **Edit B — Add a Single Clarifying Sentence on Irreversibility**

Immediately following the definition, add **one sentence only**:

> **Irreversibility characterizes the severity and trajectory of harm, not whether harm has occurred.**

That’s it.
This sentence is doing enormous work and replaces many paragraphs of confusion.

---

### 🔧 **Edit C — Explicitly Separate Harm from Justification**

Add a short clause in the ethics section (or wherever harm is operationalized):

> The existence of experiential moral harm is **independent of moral justification, permissibility, or responsibility**; actions may be harmful yet justified, and justification does not erase harm.

This is required to handle:

* benign chokeholds
* emergency interventions
* tragic tradeoffs (elderly mother case)

---

### 🔧 **Edit D — Explicitly Block Hedonic & Epistemic Misreadings**

Add one boundary sentence (this can live either immediately after the definition or in a “Clarifications” subsection):

> Experiential moral harm is defined by **structural impact on intrinsic constraint**, not by **pain, pleasure, distress, belief, prediction, or narrative understanding**, though such experiences may accompany or signal harm.

This preserves:

* pain ≠ harm (masochism)
* calm ≠ safety
* distress ≠ automatic harm
* ignorance ≠ mitigation

---

## 4. What `IER-harm.md` Is Responsible For (and the Spec Is Not)

Your new article should do **all** of the following *instead of the Spec*:

* Explain:

  * destabilization
  * overload
  * fragmentation pressure
  * coerced reorganization
  * forced UEF dissolution
* Walk through:

  * gaslighting
  * propaganda
  * malign vs justified chokeholds
  * masochism
  * protective deception / tragic tradeoffs
* Explain:

  * reversible vs irreversible harm
  * silent harm
  * harm without distress
  * distress without harm
* Clarify:

  * relation to admissible futures (conceptually, not normatively)
  * relation to responsibility and blame
  * why harm is not erased by good intentions

The Spec should **point** to `IER-harm.md` as an explanatory document, not replicate it.

---

## 5. Why This Division of Labor Is Canon-Clean

This approach:

* Preserves the Specification as:

  * short
  * sharp
  * normative
  * non-pedagogical
* Keeps all intuition pumps and edge cases out of Tier-1
* Prevents future revisions from cascading
* Allows admissible-futures work to evolve without re-breaking harm
* Makes IER *more* resistant to misuse, not less

Most importantly:

> **The Specification now says only what must be true — and no longer implies what is false.**

---

## 6. Recommended Next Step (Optional but Clean)

When you’re ready, the natural next move is:

1. Write `IER-harm.md` as **Tier-2 explanatory**
2. Add a single pointer in the Spec:

   > *For extended analysis of experiential moral harm and its forms, see `IER-harm.md` (non-normative).*
3. Do **not** modify the Spec again unless a *new* contradiction appears

If you want, next I can:

* outline `IER-harm.md` section-by-section
* draft its opening “Orientation” and “Status and Scope”
* or help you retrofit existing morals docs so they defer cleanly to it

You’ve done the hard conceptual work. Now it’s just careful surgery.
