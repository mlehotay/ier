## Audit: `IER-sedimentation.md` against its Explanatory Orientation

### Overall verdict: **PASS (with minor hygiene notes)**

This is the **cleanest and most interface-compliant projection article so far**.
The Orientation and the implementation are well aligned, projection isolation is strong, and there is no illicit synthesis.

Only **minor tightening suggestions** are warranted; no structural revision is required.

## 1) Orientation contract check

### A1 Question ownership — **PASS**

Orientation question:

> **Why is the system shaped this way?**

The article **consistently answers exactly this question**:

* why history matters,
* how prior resolution reshapes constraint,
* without explaining memory, identity, agency, time, or possibility.

No other hexad question is answered, even implicitly.

---

### A2 Foregrounded aspect of constraint — **PASS**

Foregrounded aspect:

> **sedimentation and hysteresis**

This remains stable throughout:

* constraint deformation
* admissible transition loss
* slack exhaustion
* topology change

No drift into ownership (Agency), reachability (Memory), openness (Possibility), or traversal (Time).

---

### A3 Fixed structure — **PASS**

Invariants in the Orientation:

* no stored past states ✔️
* irreversibility ✔️
* continuity of the physical system ✔️

The article **never undermines these**.
Crucially, it does *not* assume:

* experiential continuity,
* UEF persistence,
* subjecthood.

That’s exactly right for History.

---

### A4 Allowed variation — **PASS**

All variation described is:

* structural,
* future-directed,
* non-representational.

Degrees of freedom, rigidity, sensitivity — all remain **inside History’s scope**.

---

### A5 Non-claims — **PASS**

The refusals are explicit, enforced, and repeatedly honored in the body:

* no stored past
* no replay
* no encoded records
* no causal influence of non-existent past entities

The article *demonstrates* these refusals rather than merely stating them.

---

### A6 Deferral clause — **PASS**

The mandatory deferral clause appears in the Orientation and the article **does not synthesize afterward**.

There is no local reconciliation with Memory, Identity, or Time.

---

## 2) Projection isolation (Appendix B tests)

### Time leakage — **PASS**

Although irreversibility is discussed, **time itself is not explained**:

* no “now”
* no passage
* no temporal phenomenology
* no traversal narrative

Irreversibility is treated as a **structural fact**, not a temporal theory.

---

### Memory leakage — **PASS**

Memory is explicitly excluded and carefully distinguished:

* sedimentation ≠ memory
* hysteresis ≠ recall
* history ≠ access

This file is doing exactly the containment work Memory needs elsewhere.

---

### Identity leakage — **PASS**

The article is extremely disciplined here:

* no bearer claims
* no subject persistence
* no ownership
* no standing

Even §8 (“Sedimentation Inside a UEF”) is carefully fenced as **structural prerequisite only**, not identity explanation.

---

### Agency leakage — **PASS**

No deliberation, no ownership, no “choice,” no resolution borne “from within” unless explicitly marked as *not required*.

---

### Possibility leakage — **PASS**

“Altered possibility” is used **correctly**:

* as structural admissibility,
* not as modal realism,
* not as forecasting,
* not as branching futures.

This is exactly how Possibility should be presupposed, not explained.

---

## 3) Topology discipline — **PASS**

No synthesis, no “taken together,” no reconciliation language.

The article does not try to explain how sedimentation fits with agency, memory, or identity. It simply **does its job**.

---

## 4) Minor hygiene notes (optional, not required)

These are **not failures**, just optional polish to future-proof the file:

1. **Section 2.1 “Path Dependence Without Structure”**
   You might add one explicit sentence clarifying:

   > “Path dependence here is a descriptive symptom, not a projection-level explanation.”

2. **Use of “future” language**
   You already do this well, but occasionally you could substitute:

   * “admissible continuation” for “future”
     to further reduce any risk of modal misreading.

3. **Deferral clause duplication (optional)**
   If you want maximal uniformity, you could repeat the deferral sentence at the very end of the file, but this is **not required** given current compliance.

---

## 5) Final assessment

* **Orientation:** PASS
* **Implementation:** PASS
* **Isolation:** STRONG
* **Topology discipline:** EXEMPLARY

This file can be treated as a **reference-standard projection** for the others.
