## **I. Navigation & Orientation Tasks**

These tasks improve **access, entry, and usability only**.

They do not add explanation, interpretation, or emphasis.

* [ ] `IER-glossary.md`
  Canon-constrained definitions; blocks imported meanings.

* [ ] `IER-index.md`
  Concept-to-location navigation only; no summaries or reinterpretation.

* [ ] **Cross-link glossary entries to first canonical usage**

  * Each term links to its first authoritative introduction.
  * No added exposition or paraphrase permitted.

* [ ] **Audit README reading paths**

  * Remove redundancy, loops, or dead ends.
  * Ensure all suggested paths terminate in closed Tier-1 material.

* [ ] **Add minimal “where to go next” pointers**

  * Target audiences: philosophy, neuroscience, ethics, AI.
  * Descriptive only; no endorsement or interpretive steering.

## **III. Misuse & Misreading Containment (Mandatory)**

These tasks preserve **long-term stability** of interpretation.

* [ ] **Scan Tier-2 documents for diagnostic or proxy language**

  * Eliminate phrasing that could be read as:

    * thresholds
    * indicators
    * sufficient conditions
    * measurable correlates

* [ ] **Verify informational-language disclaimers**

  * Every document using informational terms must include the required disclaimer.

* [ ] **Audit phenomenology-adjacent documents**

  * Ensure no implication of graded subjecthood, partial experience, or liminal standing.

* [ ] **Reinforce “experiential structure ≠ epistemic authority”**

  * Required in meaning-, insight-, agency-, narrative-, and belief-adjacent texts.

## **VI. Consistency & Drift Audits (Ongoing, Non-Blocking)**

Maintenance only.

* [ ] Tier-1 / Tier-2 language consistency checks
