# Implementation Steps to Achieve ~100% Rubric Coverage

---

## Phase 5 — Implement D9 (`IER-contrast-matrix.md`)

**Objective:** Prevent mis-evaluation via forced commensurability.

14. Create the contrast matrix with columns aligned to **rubric dimensions**, not experimental ones.
15. Include explicit notes where:

    * IER refuses diagnostics *in principle*
    * comparison is structurally incommensurable
16. Do **not** rank or score theories.

> Acceptance check: comparison clarifies differences without implying IER is “missing” features.

---

## Phase 6 — Manifest Update (M1)

**Objective:** Make rubric coverage discoverable and official.

17. Update `IER-manifest.md` to include:

    * D1 with Appendix A
    * D5, D8, D9 at correct tiers
18. Ensure tier logic matches canon roles (T4 = orientation, T3 = misuse-blocking).

> Acceptance check: a reader browsing the manifest can find the rubric mapping immediately.

## Phase 7 — Final Canon Sweep (Definition of Done)

**Objective:** Verify “~100% rubric coverage” is actually true.

19. Take the **rubric checklist** and perform a dry run:

    * For each principle, start at the rubric
    * Jump to Appendix A
    * Follow the pointer
20. Confirm that for every principle:

    * There is **no missing pointer**
    * The language does **not** imply diagnostics or thresholds
    * Rejections are explicit, not silent
21. Confirm the project still truthfully asserts:

    * Identity with UEF operation
    * Categorical subjecthood
    * Structural non-diagnosability

## End State (What “100% Coverage” Means Here)

After these steps:

* Every rubric demand has:

  * an explicit IER answer *or refusal*
  * a canonical pointer
* No evaluator can claim:

  * “IER didn’t address X”
  * “IER is vague here”
* Any remaining disagreement is:

  * ontological or methodological
  * not due to missing articulation

That satisfies your rubric **on its own terms**, without softening IER or turning it into a detection framework.
