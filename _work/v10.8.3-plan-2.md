# v10.8.5-plan-0.md

### **v10.8.5 — Rubric hardening**

So: keep the rubric release **purely evaluation-facing**.

**Keep in the rubric release (T3/T4, evaluation-facing):**

* **D1 `IER-explanandum.md`** (T4)
* **D5 `IER-identity-conditions.md`** (T3)
* **D8 `IER-falsifiability.md`** (T3)
* **D9 `IER-contrast-matrix.md`** (T2 appendix *or* folded into `IER-contrast.md` as an appendix)
* **AI clarification** only insofar as it is *misuse-blocking / “no certification”* (could be an appendix to `IER-slack.md`)

## **V. Optional Standalone Explanatory Articles (Non-Required)**

These are **audience-management tools only**.

They introduce no theory and are not required for closure.

* [ ] **`IER-regimes.md`**

  * Regime vs. description
  * Why regime talk does not imply modeling-level equivalence

* [ ] **`IER-and-engineering.md`**

  * What IER does *not* license in AI or systems engineering
  * Why “build-and-test” intuitions fail structurally

Failure to complete these documents does **not** indicate unfinished theory.
