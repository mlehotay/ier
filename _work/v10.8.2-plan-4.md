# **IER Book — v10.8.2 Remaining Work Checklist (Plan-4)**

This document enumerates **all remaining work required to fully satisfy the v10.8.2 book governance plan**, based on the current repository state, scripts, and build tooling.

It replaces informal TODOs and serves as the **final convergence checklist** for v10.8.2.

---

## 0. Scope and Intent

This checklist covers:

* governance alignment
* validation completeness
* structural enforcement
* documentation clarity

It **does not** propose new architecture, new theory, or future features.

Completion of every unchecked item below is required for v10.8.2 to be considered **done**.

---

## 1. Preface Inclusion and Placement (REQUIRED)

* [ ] Ensure `IER-paper/IER-paper.md` is **explicitly included** in the book build.
* [ ] Enforce Preface placement:

  * [ ] after `00-front-matter.md`
  * [ ] before `01-theory.md` (Part I sentinel)
* [ ] Ensure Preface is included **exactly once**.
* [ ] Tighten Preface identification:

  * [ ] default validator regex matches the intended Preface path (not a loose substring match).
* [ ] Ensure Preface is:

  * [ ] treated as *non-authoritative*
  * [ ] never counted as a chapter
  * [ ] allowed explicitly by validation rules.

---

## 2. Manifest Parsing: Part I / II / III Segmentation (CRITICAL)

* [ ] Update manifest parsing to extract **three distinct ordered lists**:

  * [ ] Part I chapters
  * [ ] Part II chapters
  * [ ] Part III chapters
* [ ] Stop book extraction at **Part IV** (non-book material).
* [ ] Remove reliance on a single flat “Parts I–III” chapter list for validation.

---

## 3. Sentinel Enforcement (STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY)

### Presence and Uniqueness

* [ ] Enforce presence of **exactly one** of each sentinel:

  * [ ] `01-theory.md`
  * [ ] `02-applications.md`
  * [ ] `03-meta.md`

### Order

* [ ] Enforce strict ordering:

  * `01-theory.md` → `02-applications.md` → `03-meta.md`

### Part Segmentation

* [ ] Enforce that:

  * [ ] Only Part I chapters appear between `01-theory.md` and `02-applications.md`
  * [ ] Only Part II chapters appear between `02-applications.md` and `03-meta.md`
  * [ ] Only Part III chapters appear after `03-meta.md`
* [ ] Fail validation if any chapter crosses Part boundaries.

### Sentinel Content Rules

* [ ] Enforce that sentinel files:

  * [ ] contain no chapter-level headers
  * [ ] do not introduce canonical content
* [ ] Define and enforce what constitutes a “chapter-level header” (e.g., `##`).

---

## 4. Validation Allowlist (INPUT HYGIENE)

* [ ] Enforce a strict allowlist of permitted book inputs:

  * [ ] canonical chapters (`IER/IER-*.md`)
  * [ ] Preface source (`IER-paper/IER-paper.md`)
  * [ ] book scaffold / sentinel files (e.g., `pub/corpus-book/*`)
* [ ] Fail validation if any other path appears in the book input list.
* [ ] Ensure no file under `IER/` other than canonical chapters is allowed.

---

## 5. Chapter Membership and Ordering (MANIFEST AUTHORITY)

* [ ] Ensure validation fails if:

  * [ ] any Manifest Part I–III chapter is missing
  * [ ] any non-manifest chapter is included
  * [ ] chapter ordering differs from the manifest
* [ ] Enforce **exact order match**, not just set equality.

---

## 6. Glyph and Math-Mode Discipline (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED, VERIFY COVERAGE)

* [ ] Confirm glyph checks apply to:

  * [ ] all canonical chapters
  * [ ] Preface content
* [ ] Confirm sentinel files are included or excluded intentionally.
* [ ] Confirm `--skip-glyphs` mode is documented and intentional.

---

## 7. Build Gating (FAIL LOUDLY)

* [ ] Re-enable validation as a hard dependency for:

  * [ ] corpus book build
  * [ ] any public or tagged release
* [ ] Ensure no Pandoc rendering occurs if validation fails.

---

## 8. Script Naming and Role Alignment

* [ ] Resolve naming mismatch:

  * [ ] `verify_book.py` vs `validate_book.py`
* [ ] Ensure documentation and Makefile agree on:

  * [ ] script names
  * [ ] responsibilities (structure vs rendering).

---

## 9. Documentation Clarifications (GOVERNANCE)

### Authority and Non-Authority

* [ ] Explicitly state:

  * [ ] `IER-book/` is non-authoritative
  * [ ] it cannot override `IER-canon`, `IER-manifest`, or `IER-specification`
* [ ] Bind book structure explicitly to `IER-book.md`.

### Build Process (Operational)

* [ ] Add a short “Build Quickstart” explaining:

  * [ ] entrypoint(s)
  * [ ] generated artifacts
  * [ ] what validation enforces
  * [ ] what renderers do *not* decide

### Validation Rules

* [ ] Document validator hard constraints explicitly:

  * [ ] input allowlist
  * [ ] Part boundaries
  * [ ] Preface rules
  * [ ] sentinel rules
  * [ ] manifest supremacy

### Scaffold File Roles

* [ ] Document the role of each scaffold file (not its prose content).

---

## 10. Legal / Disclosure Posture

* [ ] Clarify:

  * [ ] `IER-legal.md` is reference-only
  * [ ] disclosure text (if any) lives in front matter
  * [ ] omission of disclosure does not affect authority or authorship

---

## 11. Output Contracts (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)

* [ ] Define stable output naming conventions tied to v10.8.2.
* [ ] Clarify which formats are authoritative for structure vs archival use.

---

## 12. Hygiene Sweep (MANDATORY)

* [ ] Repo-wide removal of legacy language:

  * [ ] “division”
  * [ ] “two parts”
  * [ ] pre-v10.8.2 structure references
* [ ] Ensure all docs consistently state:

  * [ ] “three Parts”
  * [ ] “manifest-driven”
  * [ ] “v10.8.2”

---

## 13. Definition of Done (v10.8.2)

v10.8.2 is complete **only when**:

* [ ] All checklist items above are satisfied.
* [ ] Validation fails on any structural drift.
* [ ] Book structure is mechanically derivable from upstream authority.
* [ ] Renderers never infer structure.
* [ ] Documentation and tooling state the same rules.

---

## Final Statement

> v10.8.2 is complete when the IER book is a **validation-first, mechanically enforced projection** of canonical theory, whose structure is immutable upstream and whose build fails loudly on any violation.
