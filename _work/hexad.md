# The Six Top-Level Projection Articles

## 1. **IER-time.md**

### *Time as Asymmetric Constraint Traversal*

**Core claim**

> Time is not a container, parameter, or stored sequence.
> It is the asymmetry induced by irreversible constraint resolution within a Unified Experiential Field.

**Primary questions answered**

* Why does experience feel like it moves forward?
* Why is there a “now” without a privileged present?
* Why temporal passage survives determinism?

**Structural focus**

* Irreversibility
* Collapse of admissible futures
* Temporal continuity as dynamical dependence

**Explicit non-claims**

* No metaphysics of spacetime
* No privileged present
* No temporal primitives beyond dynamics

**Dependencies**

* `IER-dynamics.md`
* `IER-continuity.md`
* `IER-topology.md`

## 2. **IER-memory.md** *(already exists, but becomes a Stone)*

### *Memory as Constraint-Structured Re-Entry*

**Core claim**

> Memory is not retention of the past.
> It is the continued admissibility of certain experiential organizations into the future.

**Primary questions answered**

* Why remembering is future-facing
* Why forgetting is not loss
* Why memory can fail without damage

**Structural focus**

* Reachability
* Participation pathways
* Re-entry under current constraint

**Explicit non-claims**

* No storage
* No engrams
* No internal archives

**Dependencies**

* `IER-forgetting.md`
* `IER-hysteresis.md`
* `IER-topology.md`

*(This article already exists; its role is clarified, not rewritten.)*

## 3. **IER-identity.md**

### *Identity as Persistence of Constraint Ownership*

**Core claim**

> Identity persists not by sameness of content, memory, or narrative,
> but by continued ownership of admissible futures under intrinsic constraint.

**Primary questions answered**

* Why you remain you across radical change
* Why memory loss doesn’t erase identity
* Why continuity survives experiential gaps

**Structural focus**

* System persistence
* Forward-structured ownership
* UEF continuity vs regime interruption

**Explicit non-claims**

* No psychological criteria
* No narrative self as identity
* No experiential accumulation

**Dependencies**

* `IER-persistence.md`
* `IER-continuity.md`
* `IER-topology.md`

## 4. **IER-agency.md** *(already exists, but becomes a Stone)*

### *Agency as Owned Resolution of Constraint*

**Core claim**

> Agency is not freedom from causation or representation of options.
> It is the owned collapse of admissible futures under intrinsic constraint.

**Primary questions answered**

* What choice really is
* Why inevitability can still be agency
* How coercion modifies responsibility

**Structural focus**

* Choice spaces
* Collapse
* Ownership vs mere resolution

**Explicit non-claims**

* No indeterminism
* No executive controller
* No homunculus

**Dependencies**

* `IER-choice.md`
* `IER-resolution.md`
* `IER-topology.md`

*(Again: role elevation, not conceptual change.)*

## 5. **IER-history.md**

### *History as Sedimented Constraint*

**Core claim**

> History persists without storage.
> What remains is not the past, but the loss of degrees of freedom caused by it.

**Primary questions answered**

* Why you cannot respond as you once did
* Why trauma, learning, and calibration matter
* Why the past shapes without being present

**Structural focus**

* Sedimentation
* Hysteresis
* Path dependence

**Explicit non-claims**

* No retained traces
* No encoded past
* No replay

**Dependencies**

* `IER-sedimentation.md`
* `IER-hysteresis.md`
* `IER-topology.md`

## 6. **IER-possibility.md**

### *Possibility as Open Constraint Topology*

**Core claim**

> Possibility is not imagination, probability, or expectation.
> It is the structure of physically admissible continuations under current constraint.

**Primary questions answered**

* What “could still happen” really means
* Why options disappear over time
* Why saturation feels like being trapped

**Structural focus**

* Admissible futures
* Slack vs saturation
* Topological openness and closure

**Explicit non-claims**

* No modal metaphysics
* No counterfactual worlds
* No optimization

**Dependencies**

* `IER-futures.md`
* `IER-saturation.md`
* `IER-topology.md`

# How the Pieces Fit Canonically

* **`IER-topology.md`**
  → names the shared object and proves non-duplication

* Each Stone:

  * takes **one projection**
  * answers **one family of questions**
  * refuses to explain what another Stone explains
  * explicitly defers to topology for unification

No Stone is foundational.
No Stone is privileged.
No Stone introduces machinery.

## Structural Payoff

This gives you:

* A **clean mental map** for readers
* A **canonical place** to put future refinements
* A way to talk about time, memory, identity, agency, history, and possibility **without faculty inflation**
* A conceptual architecture that feels powerful without becoming mystical

If you want, next we can:

* draft one of these six in full (my vote: **Identity** or **Possibility**), or
* add a **one-page reader map** that introduces the Stones as a set without Marvel cringe, or
* do a **canon alignment check** to make sure no existing article accidentally oversteps into another Stone’s territory.
