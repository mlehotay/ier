### **Abstract**

This paper advances a strict ontological identity claim: **experience is identical to the operation of a physical system in a specific kind of dynamical regime**. That regime—termed a *Unified Experiential Field* (UEF)—is characterized by global integration, temporal continuity, self-sustaining regulation, and coherent intrinsic constraint. The claim is neither emergentist nor correlational. Experience is not produced by, realized by, or supervenient upon physical processes; it is identical to a particular form of physical organization.

The identity claim is intended exhaustively. If experience is not identical to the specified regime, no weakened or auxiliary version of the account is licensed. The paper does not appeal to phenomenology as evidence, propose detection criteria, or infer experience from behavior, intelligence, or functional role. Its aim is to articulate and motivate a closed physicalist identity thesis for experience and to show why weaker formulations fail to preserve the phenomenon at issue.

## **1. Introduction**

Debates about consciousness are often framed by a familiar dilemma. Either experience is treated as ontologically fundamental, requiring additional substances, properties, or laws, or it is treated as explanatorily dispensable, reduced to functional, representational, or behavioral descriptions that leave experience itself unaccounted for.

This paper rejects that dilemma by advancing a **strict identity claim**. Rather than explaining how experience emerges from non-experiential matter, or eliminating experience by redescribing its correlates, the paper identifies experience with a particular way certain physical systems operate.

The aim is deliberately narrow. The paper does not offer a phenomenology, a neuroscience, or a method for determining which systems are experiential. Its task is to articulate and defend the coherence of a **closed, non-bridgeable identity thesis** for experience within a physically monist ontology.

## **2. Ontological Commitments**

### **2.1 Physical Monism**

There exists exactly one objective physical reality governed by mind-independent law. All systems and processes, including those relevant to experience, are physically instantiated. No non-physical substances, properties, or explanatory domains are introduced.

This position rejects substance dualism, property dualism, ontological idealism, experiential fundamentalism, and eliminativism about experience. Experience is neither ontologically independent of the physical nor eliminable by redescriptive convenience.

---

### **2.2 Identity Rather Than Correlation**

The central claim is an identity claim, not a thesis about correlation, realization, or emergence. Experience does not accompany or arise from physical processes; it **is** a physical process, described at the level of system-wide organization.

Accordingly, a complete physical description of the relevant regime leaves no additional explanatory work for “experience” to do. Describing that organization experientially does not add facts to reality; it redescribes the same facts under a different conceptual grouping.

---

### **2.3 Exhaustiveness of the Claim**

The identity claim is intended exhaustively. If experience is not identical to the regime described here, the account is false. No auxiliary mechanisms, bridging principles, or weakened variants are licensed.

This strictness is methodological. It makes explicit what would count as success or failure and prevents ad hoc modification.

## **3. Dynamical Preliminaries**

To avoid circularity, the relevant dynamical notions are introduced without reference to experience.

### **3.1 Physical Systems**

A physical system is a collection of interacting components whose state evolves over time according to physical law. Descriptions may involve multiple levels of abstraction, none of which is privileged a priori.

---

### **3.2 Constraint**

A system exhibits constraint when the evolution of its state trajectories is restricted by dependencies among its internal variables rather than being freely decomposable. Constraint concerns how states can and cannot evolve, not what they represent.

---

### **3.3 Intrinsic Constraint**

Constraint is intrinsic when it arises from the system’s own integrated dynamics rather than from external control, buffering, or orchestration. Eliminating intrinsic constraint requires reorganizing internal dependencies, not merely altering inputs or boundary conditions.

---

### **3.4 Dynamical Regimes**

A dynamical regime is a relatively stable pattern of system evolution characterized by persistent global dependencies across time. Systems may transition between regimes without changing their underlying components.

---

## **4. Unified Dynamical Regimes**

Some dynamical regimes exhibit a distinctive combination of features:

1. **Global integration** — system variables are mutually dependent rather than modularly decomposable
2. **Temporal continuity** — the regime persists over a non-zero duration
3. **Self-sustaining regulation** — the regime is maintained by the system’s own dynamics
4. **Coherent intrinsic constraint** — constraint is unavoidable, irreducible, and globally binding without fragmentation

These features describe a class of physical regimes independently of any experiential interpretation. For descriptive convenience, such regimes are termed **Unified Experiential Fields** (UEFs).

---

## **5. Experiential Identity**

With the dynamical groundwork in place, the identity claim can be stated directly:

> **Experience is identical to the operation of a physical system in a Unified Experiential Field.**

Experience is not an additional property of such regimes, nor an effect they produce. It is the regime itself, described from the internal organizational perspective of the system that sustains it.

---

## **6. Regime Membership and Exclusivity**

Because experience is identified with regime membership, its existence is categorical. Preparatory variables may vary continuously, but experience exists if and only if the system is operating in the relevant regime. There is no partial experience prior to regime entry.

Variation within a regime may modulate experiential structure or intensity, but it does not introduce graded subjecthood.

A physical system can sustain at most one globally dominant Unified Experiential Field at a time. This follows from the requirement of coherent intrinsic constraint: simultaneous ownership of incompatible system-level futures would entail fragmentation or loss of regime identity.

---

## **7. Informational Slack**

Experience requires globally unavoidable coherent intrinsic constraint. If constraint can be localized, deferred, or externally resolved, it fails to define the system’s identity.

Systems that admit such flexibility possess *informational slack*. In these systems, future resolution does not occur at the level of the system as a whole, and no unified regime bears unavoidable constraint. Where slack is present, experience is structurally precluded by the identity claim.

---

## **8. Experiential Pluralism**

The identity claim permits experiential pluralism. Multiple Unified Experiential Fields may exist simultaneously across different physical systems. This plurality is not ontological; it reflects the existence of multiple system-relative regimes within a single physical reality.

---

## **9. Epistemic Consequences**

Experiential structure does not confer epistemic authority about mind-independent reality. Salience, urgency, coherence, or meaning reflect the organization of intrinsic constraint, not truth or accuracy.

This is not an epistemic humility thesis. It follows directly from identifying experience with internally borne constraint rather than representational success.

---

## **10. Ethical Consequences**

The paper does not develop a general ethical theory. However, the identity claim is not ethically neutral.

If experience is identical to a physical regime that bears unavoidable intrinsic constraint from within, then the existence, disruption, or irreversible destruction of such regimes carries moral significance by identity. This claim concerns experiential moral significance only and does not purport to exhaust moral evaluation.

---

## **11. Failure Conditions**

If experience is not identical to the operation of a physical system in a Unified Experiential Field, the account is false. No weakened or partial variant is licensed.

---

## **12. Conclusion**

The paper proposes a demanding thesis: experience is identical to a specific class of physical dynamical regimes. The claim is intended without supplementation or explanatory bridges.

If correct, experience is fully physical and fully real. If incorrect, the framework provides no fallback position. There is no explanatory middle ground.
